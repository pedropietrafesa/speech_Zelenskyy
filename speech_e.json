  "speech": "I am addressing you at this tense moment. Our state is facing serious external and internal challenges that require responsibility, confidence and concrete actions from me and each of us. We are being intimidated by the great war and the date of the military invasion is being set again. This is not the first time. The war against us is being systematically waged on all fronts. On the military one, they increase the contingent around the border. On the diplomatic one, they are trying to deprive us of the right to determine our own foreign policy course. On the energy one, they limit the supply of gas, electricity and coal. On the information one, they seek to spread panic among citizens and investors through the media. But our state today is stronger than ever. This is not the first threat that the strong Ukrainian people have faced. Two years ago, we, like the rest of the world, looked confused in the eyes of the pandemic. However, we united and with clear systemic steps practically defeated it. In this difficult time, the strong Ukrainian people have shown their best qualities - unity and the will to win. Unlike the pandemic two years ago, today we clearly understand all the challenges we face and what to do about them. We are confident, but not self-confident. We understand all the risks. We are constantly monitoring the situation, working out different scenarios, preparing decent responses to all possible aggressive actions. We know exactly where the foreign army is near our borders, its numbers, its locations, its equipment and its plans. We have something to respond with. We have a great army. Our guys have unique combat experience and modern weapons. This is an army many times stronger than eight years ago. Along with the army, Ukrainian diplomacy is at the forefront of defending our interests. We have managed to gain diplomatic support from almost all leaders of the civilized world. Most of them have either already visited and supported Ukraine, or will do so in the near future. Today, everyone recognizes that the security of Europe and the entire continent depends on Ukraine and its army. We want peace and we want to resolve all issues exclusively through negotiations. Both Donbas and Crimea will return to Ukraine. Exclusively through diplomacy. We do not encroach on what’s not ours, but we will not give up our land. We are confident in our Armed Forces, but our military must also feel our support, our cohesion and our unity. The foothold of our army is the confidence of their own people and a strong economy. We have formed sufficient reserves to repel attacks on the hryvnia exchange rate and our financial system. We will not ignore any industry that will need government support. As it happened the other day with airlines. And evidence of this is a stable hryvnia exchange rate and open skies. An important front of defense is the objective coverage of the situation by the domestic media. And now I want to address our Ukrainian journalists. Some of you sometimes have to perform the tasks of media owners. Most of them have already fled their own country. Work for Ukraine, not for those who fled. The fate of the country today depends on your honest position. And now I want to address not those who stayed with Ukraine and in Ukraine, but those who left it at the most crucial moment. Your strength is not in your money and planes, but in the civic position you can show. Return to your people and the country due to which you got your factories and wealth. Today, everyone passes a real test for a citizen of Ukraine. Pass it with dignity. Let everyone understand for whom Ukraine is really the Homeland, and for whom it is just a platform for money making. I address separately all representatives of the state: civil servants, people's deputies of all levels who have fled the country or plan to do so. The people of Ukraine have entrusted you not only to govern the state, but also to protect it. It is your direct duty in this situation to be with us, with the Ukrainian people. I urge you to return to your homeland within 24 hours and stand side by side with the Ukrainian army, diplomacy and people! We are told that February 16 will be the day of the attack. We will make it the Day of Unity. The relevant decree has already been signed. On this day, we will hoist national flags, put on blue and yellow ribbons and show the world our unity. We have one great European aspiration. We want freedom and are ready to fight for it. 14,000 defenders and civilians killed in this war are watching us from the sky. And we will not betray their memory. We all want to live happily, and happiness loves the strong ones. We have never known what it is to give up and we are not going to learn that. Today is not just Valentine's Day. It is the day of those in love with Ukraine. We believe in our own strength and continue to build our future together. Because we are united by love for Ukraine, united and unique. And love will win. Yes, now you may think it's darkness all around. But tomorrow the sun will rise again over our peaceful sky."

  "speech": "Ukraine wants peace. Europe wants peace. The world says it doesn't want to fight, and Russia says it doesn't want to attack. Someone is lying. This is not an axiom, but it is no longer a hypothesis. Two days ago I was in Donbas, on the delimitation line. Legally - between Ukraine and the temporarily occupied territories. In fact, the delimitation line between peace and war. Where on the one side there is a kindergarten, and on the other side there is a projectile that hit it. On the one side there is a school, on the other side there is a projectile hitting the school yard. And next to it there are 30 children who go… no, not to NATO, but to school. Someone has physics classes. Knowing its basic laws, even children understand how absurd the statements that the shelling is carried out by Ukraine sound. Someone has math classes. Children can calculate the difference between the number of shelling occasions in these three days and the occasions of mentioning Ukraine in this year's Munich Security Report without a calculator. And someone has history classes. And when a bomb crater appears in the school yard, children have a question: has the world forgotten its mistakes of the XX century? What do attempts at appeasement lead to? As the question \"Why die for Danzig?\" turned into the need to die for Dunkirk and dozens of other cities in Europe and the world. At the cost of tens of millions of lives. These are terrible lessons of history. I just want to make sure you and I read the same books. Hence, we have the same understanding of the answer to the main question: how did it happen that in the XXI century, Europe is at war again and people are dying? Why does it last longer than World War II? How did we get to the biggest security crisis since the Cold War? For me, as the President of a country that has lost part of the territory, thousands of people and on whose borders there are now 150,000 Russian troops, equipment and heavy weapons, the answer is obvious. The architecture of world security is fragile and needs to be updated. The rules that the world agreed on decades ago no longer work. They do not keep up with new threats. They are not effective for overcoming them. This is a cough syrup when you need a coronavirus vaccine. The security system is slow. It crashes again. Because of different things: selfishness, self-confidence, irresponsibility of states at the global level. As a result, we have crimes of some and indifference of others. Indifference that makes you an accomplice. It is symbolic that I am talking about this right here. It was here 15 years ago that Russia announced its intention to challenge global security. What did the world say? Appeasement. Result? At least - the annexation of Crimea and aggression against my state. The UN, which is supposed to defend peace and world security, cannot defend itself. When its Charter is violated. When one of the members of the UN Security Council annexes the territory of one of the founding members of the UN. And the UN itself ignores the Crimea Platform, the goal of which is to de-occupy Crimea peacefully and protect the rights of Crimeans. Three years ago, it was here that Angela Merkel said: “Who will pick up the wreckage of the world order? Only all of us, together.\" The audience gave a standing ovation. But, unfortunately, the collective applause did not grow into collective action. And now, when the world is talking about the threat of a great war, the question arises: is there anything left to pick up? The security architecture in Europe and the world is almost destroyed. It's too late to think about repairs, it's time to build a new system. Mankind has done this twice, paying too high a price - two world wars. We have a chance to break this trend until it becomes a consistent pattern. And start building a new system before millions of victims. Having the old lessons of the First and Second World Wars, not our own experience of the possible third, God forbid. I talked about it here. And on the rostrum of the UN. That in the XXI century there are no more foreign wars. That the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas affects the whole world. And this is not a war in Ukraine, but a war in Europe. I said this at summits and forums. In 2019, 2020, 2021. Will the world be able to hear me in 2022? This is no longer a hypothesis, but not an axiom yet. Why? Evidence is needed. More important than words on Twitter or statements in the media. Action is required. It is the world that needs it, not just us. We will defend our land with or without the support of partners. Whether they give us hundreds of modern weapons or five thousand helmets. We appreciate any help, but everyone should understand that these are not charitable contributions that Ukraine should ask for or remind of. These are not noble gestures for which Ukraine should bow low. This is your contribution to the security of Europe and the world. Where Ukraine has been a reliable shield for eight years. And for eight years it has been rebuffing one of the world's biggest armies. Which stands along our borders, not the borders of the EU. And Grad rockets hit Mariupol, not European cities. And after almost six months of fighting, the airport in Donetsk was destroyed, not in Frankfurt. And it's always hot in the Avdiivka industrial zone - it was hot there in the last days, not in Montmartre. And no European country knows what military burials every day in all regions are. And no European leader knows what regular meetings with the families of the deceased are. Be that as it may, we will defend our beautiful land no matter if we have 50,000, 150 or one million soldiers of any army on the border. To really help Ukraine, it is not necessary to say how many servicemen and military equipment are on the border. Say what numbers we have. To really help Ukraine, it is not necessary to constantly talk only about the dates of the probable invasion. We will defend our land on February 16, March 1 and December 31. We need other dates much more. And everyone understands perfectly well which ones. Tomorrow in Ukraine is the Day of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred. Eight years ago, Ukrainians made their choice, and many gave their lives for that choice. Eight years later, should Ukraine constantly call for recognition of the European perspective? Since 2014, Russia has been convincing that we have chosen the wrong path, that no one is waiting for us in Europe. Shouldn't Europe constantly say and prove by action that this is not true? Shouldn't the EU say today that its citizens are positive about Ukraine's accession to the Union? Why do we avoid this question? Doesn't Ukraine deserve direct and honest answers? This also applies to NATO. We are told: the door is open. But so far authorized access only. If not all members of the Alliance want to see us or all members of the Alliance do not want to see us, be honest. Open doors are good, but we need open answers, not open questions for years. Isn't the right to the truth one of our enhanced opportunities? The best time for it is the next summit in Madrid. Russia says Ukraine seeks to join the Alliance to return Crimea by force. It is gratifying that the words \"return Crimea\" appear in their rhetoric. But they inattentively read Article 5 of the NATO Charter: collective action is for protection, not offensive. Crimea and the occupied regions of Donbas will certainly return to Ukraine, but only peacefully. Ukraine consistently implements the Normandy agreements and the Minsk agreements. Their foundation is the unquestionable recognition of the territorial integrity and independence of our state. We seek a diplomatic settlement of the armed conflict. Note: solely on the basis of international law. So what is really going on in the peace process? Two years ago, we agreed with the Presidents of France, the Russian Federation, the Chancellor of Germany on a full-scale ceasefire. And Ukraine is scrupulously adhering to these agreements. We are as restrained as possible against the background of constant provocations. We are constantly making proposals in the framework of the Normandy Four and the Trilateral Contact Group. And what do we see? Shells and bullets from the other side. Our soldiers and civilians are being killed and wounded, and civilian infrastructure is being destroyed. The last days have become especially illustrative. Hundreds of massive shelling occasions with weapons prohibited by the Minsk agreements. It is also important to stop restricting the admission of OSCE observers to Ukraine's TOT. They are threatened. They are intimidated. All humanitarian issues are blocked. Two years ago, I signed a law on the unconditional admission of representatives of humanitarian organizations to detainees. But they are simply not admitted to the temporarily occupied territories. After two exchanges of captives, the process was blocked, although Ukraine provided agreed lists. Inhuman torture at the infamous Isolation Prison in Donetsk has become a symbol of human rights abuses. The two new checkpoints we opened in November 2020 in the Luhansk region still do not function - and here we see outright obstruction under contrived pretexts. Ukraine is doing everything possible to reach progress in discussions and political issues. In the TCG, in the Minsk process, we’ve put forward proposals - draft laws, but everything is blocked - no one talks about them. Ukraine demands to unblock the negotiation process immediately. But this does not mean that the search for peace is limited to it alone. We are ready to look for the key to the end of the war in all possible formats and platforms: Paris, Berlin, Minsk. Istanbul, Geneva, Brussels, New York, Beijing - I don't care where in the world to negotiate peace in Ukraine. It does not matter if four countries, seven or a hundred participate, the main thing is that Ukraine and Russia are among them. What is really important is the understanding that peace is needed not only by us, the world needs peace in Ukraine. Peace and restoration of territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders. This is the only way. And I hope no one thinks of Ukraine as a convenient and eternal buffer zone between the West and Russia. This will never happen. Nobody will allow that. Otherwise - who's next? Will NATO countries have to defend each other? I want to believe that the North Atlantic Treaty and Article 5 will be more effective than the Budapest Memorandum. Ukraine has received security guarantees for abandoning the world's third nuclear capability. We don't have that weapon. We also have no security. We also do not have part of the territory of our state that is larger in area than Switzerland, the Netherlands or Belgium. And most importantly - we don’t have millions of our citizens. We don’t have all this. Therefore, we have something. The right to demand a shift from a policy of appeasement to ensuring security and peace guarantees. Since 2014, Ukraine has tried three times to convene consultations with the guarantor states of the Budapest Memorandum. Three times without success. Today Ukraine will do it for the fourth time. I, as President, will do this for the first time. But both Ukraine and I are doing this for the last time. I am initiating consultations in the framework of the Budapest Memorandum. The Minister of Foreign Affairs was commissioned to convene them. If they do not happen again or their results do not guarantee security for our country, Ukraine will have every right to believe that the Budapest Memorandum is not working and all the package decisions of 1994 are in doubt. I also propose to convene a summit of permanent members of the UN Security Council in the coming weeks with the participation of Ukraine, Germany and Turkey in order to address security challenges in Europe. And elaborate new, effective security guarantees for Ukraine. Guarantees today, as long as we are not a member of the Alliance and in fact are in the gray zone - in a security vacuum. What else can we do now? Continue to effectively support Ukraine and its defense capabilities. Provide Ukraine with a clear European perspective, the tools of support available to candidate countries, and clear and comprehensive timeframes for joining the Alliance. Support the transformation in our country. Establish a Stability and Reconstruction Fund for Ukraine, a land-lease program, the supply of the latest weapons, machinery and equipment for our army - an army that protects the whole of Europe. Develop an effective package of preventive sanctions to deter aggression. Guarantee Ukraine's energy security, ensure its integration into the EU energy market when Nord Stream 2 is used as a weapon. All these questions need answers. So far we have silence instead of them. And as long as there is silence, there will be no silence in the east of our state. That is - in Europe. That is - in the whole world. I hope the whole world finally understands this, Europe understands. Ladies and Gentlemen! I thank all the states that supported Ukraine today. In words, in declarations, in concrete help. Those who are on our side today. On the side of truth and international law. I'm not calling you by name - I don't want some other countries to be ashamed. But this is their business, this is their karma. And this is on their conscience. However, I do not know how they will be able to explain their actions to the two soldiers killed and three wounded in Ukraine today. And most importantly - to three girls from Kyiv. One is ten years old, the second is six, and the third is only one. Today they were left without a father. At 6 o'clock in the morning Central European Time. When the Ukrainian intelligence officer, Captain Anton Sydorov was killed as a result of artillery fire prohibited by the Minsk agreements. I don't know what he thought at the last moment of his life. He definitely didn't know what agenda someone needs to meet to end the war. But he knows exactly the answer to the question I asked at the beginning. He knows exactly who of us is lying. May his memory live forever. May the memory of all those who died today and during the war in the east of our state live forever."

  "speech": "Citizens of Ukraine. What do we hear today? It's not just rocket explosions, battles, the roar of aircraft. It is the sound of a new Iron Curtain lowering and closing Russia away from the civilized world. Our national task is to make this curtain pass not through our Ukrainian territory, but at the home of Russians. The Ukrainian army, our border guards, police and special services stopped the enemy's attacks. In the language of conflict, this can be called an operational pause. In Donbas, our Armed Forces are doing great, the Kharkiv direction is very difficult, the forces for the defense of the city are working, they are reliable, they are our men. The most problematic situation today is in the south. Our troops are fighting fierce battles in the suburbs of Kherson. The enemy is pushing out of the occupied Crimea, trying to advance towards Melitopol. In the north of the country, the enemy is slowly advancing in the Chernihiv region, but there are forces to hold it. Reliable defense is built in the Zhytomyr region. Enemy paratroopers in Hostomel are blocked, troops are ordered to destroy them. Yes, we, unfortunately, have losses, losses of our heroes. Yes, we have captured Russian soldiers. Our doctors are helping some of them - those who have surrendered. Many Russian aircraft and many armored vehicles were destroyed. Yes, we see that many Russians are shocked by what is happening. Some Russians are already calling on social media that they are against the war. We see it. But the leadership of the Russian Federation is unlikely to see it. So please. If you hear us, if you understand us, if you understand that you are attacking an independent country, please go out to the squares and address the President of your country. We are Ukrainians. We are on our land. You are Russians. Now your military has started a war. The war in our state. I would very much like you to speak on Red Square or somewhere else on the streets of your capital, in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia. Not only in Instagram - it is very important. What do we see at this hour? For the world community, Russia is becoming an analogue of the so-called DPR - this is complete isolation. I am in constant contact with the leaders of partner countries and international organizations. Russia has already begun receiving the first sanctions from a large package of sanctions, the most powerful in world history. No one will be able to convince or force us, Ukrainians, to give up our freedom, our independence, our sovereignty. But it seems that the Russian leadership is trying to do this by destroying the potential of their country. Everything that Russia has done since 2000 can now be burned live in front of the world. We emphasize that Ukraine did not choose the path of war. But Ukraine offers to return to peace. What can Ukrainians do? Help the national defense. Join the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and territorial defense units. Any citizen with combat experience will now be useful. It is up to you and all of us whether the enemy will be able to advance further into the territory of our independent state. Please help the volunteer community and the medical system, for example by donating blood. Politicians and community leaders - help people, ensure normal life on the ground as much as possible. Everyone should take care of their loved ones and take care of those neighbors or acquaintances who need it. The duty of journalists, an important duty, is to defend democracy and freedom in Ukraine. I spoke today with many leaders - the United Kingdom, Turkey, France, Germany, the EU, the United States, Sweden, Romania, Poland, Austria and others. If you, dear European leaders, dear world leaders, leaders of the free world, do not help us today, then tomorrow the war will knock on your door."

  "speech": "Men and women, our defenders! You are brilliantly defending the country from one of the most powerful countries in the world. Today Russia attacked the entire territory of our state. And today our defenders have done a lot. They defended almost the entire territory of Ukraine, which suffered direct blows. They regain the one that the enemy managed to occupy. For example, Hostomel near Kyiv. This gives more confidence to the capital. According to preliminary data, unfortunately, we have lost 137 of our heroes today - our citizens. 10 of them are officers. 316 are wounded. On our Zmiinyi Island, defending it to the last, all the border guards died heroically. But did not give up. All of them will be posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. May the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine live forever. I am grateful to everyone who saves people right now and helps maintain order in the state. The enemy strikes not only at military facilities, as it claims, but also at civilians. They kill people and turn peaceful cities into military targets. This is vile and will never be forgiven. I know that a lot of fakes are being produced now. In particular, that I allegedly left Kyiv. I stay in the capital, I stay with my people. During the day, I held dozens of international talks, directly managed our country. And I will stay in the capital. My family is also in Ukraine. My children are also in Ukraine. My family is not traitors. They are the citizens of Ukraine. But I have no right to say where they are now. According to our information, the enemy marked me as the number one target. My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the Head of State. We also have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv. That's why I am asking Kyivites very much: be careful, follow the rules of curfew. I remain in the government quarter together with all those who are necessary for the work of the central government. No matter how many conversations I had with the leaders of different countries today, I heard a few things. The first is that we are supported. And I am grateful to each state that helps Ukraine concretely, not just in words. But there is another - we are left alone in defense of our state. Who is ready to fight with us? Honestly - I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO? Honestly, everyone is afraid. Today we heard from Moscow that they still want to talk. They want to talk about Ukraine's neutral status. I tell all the partners of our state: now is an important moment - the fate of our country is being decided. I ask them: are you with us? They answer that they are with us. But they are not ready to take us to the Alliance. Today, I asked the twenty-seven leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer. And we are not afraid of anything. We are not afraid to defend our state. We are not afraid of Russia. We are not afraid to talk to Russia. We are not afraid to say everything about security guarantees for our state. We are not afraid to talk about neutral status. We are not in NATO now. But the main thing - what security guarantees will we have? And what specific countries will give them? We need to talk about the end of this invasion. We need to talk about a ceasefire. But now the fate of the country depends entirely on our army, on our heroes, our security forces, all our defenders. And on our people, your wisdom and the great support of all friends of our country."

  "speech": "The second morning of a large-scale war. At 4 am, Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. This is a lie. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas to operate. Just as yesterday, the military and civilians are equally under Russian attack. The purpose of this attack is to put pressure on you, the citizens of Ukraine, to put pressure on our entire society. I emphasize: not just on the government - on all Ukrainians. And today - even more than yesterday. Our men and women - all defenders of Ukraine - did not allow the enemy to realize the operational plan of invasion on the first day. Ukrainians demonstrate real heroism. The enemy was stopped in most directions. There are fights. Therefore, Russia's attack continues with the expectation that our forces will be tired. But no one is tired. Ukraine's air defense forces are protecting our sky. As much as possible. Enemy aircraft operate treacherously over residential areas, including the capital. Terrible explosions in the morning sky over Kyiv, bombing, hitting a house, fire - all this reminds of the first such attack on our capital, which took place in 1941. This morning we are defending our state alone, as we did yesterday. The world's most powerful forces are watching from afar. Did yesterday's sanctions convince Russia? We hear in our sky and see on our earth that this is not enough. Foreign troops are still trying to become more active in our territory. Only the solidarity and determination of Ukrainians can preserve our freedom and protect the state. The army, border guards, the National Guard, the police, intelligence, the Territorial Defense Forces - everyone performs their tasks to the maximum. It is very important that today our citizens also demonstrate maximum endurance and mutual support. Take care of your family and loved ones, but do not forget about the people around you. Those who are single, those who are older. Help them with food. Help find shelter when there is an air alarm. Help with access to verified official information. Stop the enemy wherever you see it. The fate of Ukraine depends only on Ukrainians. No one but ourselves will control our lives. We are on our land, the truth is on our side. It will not be possible to destroy our character. Kalibr missiles are helpless against our freedom. Russia will still have to talk to us sooner or later. Talk about how to end the fighting and stop this invasion. The sooner the conversation begins, the smaller Russia's losses will be. Dear citizens of the Russian Federation. As I said, tonight they started bombing residential areas of the hero city of Kyiv. It all reminds me of 1941. To all the citizens of the Russian Federation who come out to protest, I want to say - we see you. This means that you heard us. This means that you begin to trust us. Fight for us. Fight against the war."

  "speech": "Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz yesterday said Russia's invasion of Ukraine is something Europe has not seen for 75 years. And it's true. But this is not the whole truth. This is not just Russia's invasion in Ukraine, this is the beginning of the war against Europe. Against the unity of Europe. Against elementary human rights in Europe. Against all coexistence rules on the continent. Against the fact that European states refuse to divide, yes, to divide the borders by force. The cities of Ukraine undergo rocket bombing for the second day already. Tank columns and air strikes are as similar as something Europe has already seen a long time ago - during the Second World War and talked \"never again\" about it. But this is it! Again. Now. In 2022. 75 years after the Second World War completion. I’m confident you see it - all of you, entire Europe. But we do not see in full what you are going to do. How are you going to protect yourself when you help us so slowly in Ukraine? I’d like to point out what has already happened. And for this we are grateful. Sectoral sanctions. The United States, Canada, United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand introduced precisely sectoral sanctions against Russia. In particular, against all the largest banks. Against the largest Russian enterprises. Against Russia's access to Western technologies. But Russian tanks are still shooting at residential buildings in our cities. Armored vehicles are still attacking, including civilians. Ordinary citizens of Ukraine. Europe has sufficient force to stop this aggression. What to expect from European states further? Cancellation of visas for Russians? Cutting off Swift? Full isolation of Russia? Recalling ambassadors? Oil embargo? Closure of the sky? Today, all this should be on the table, because it is a threat to us, all of us, all of Europe. You can still stop aggression. We must act without delay. Ordinary people can also do their part of the job, I'm sure, in every country of the world, in each country of Europe. Go out on the square of your cities and demand peace for Europe, peace for Ukraine, stop this war. Go out, go out on the squares and demand to stop the war. This is our right. This is your right. When bombs fall in Kyiv, this happens in Europe, not only in Ukraine. When missiles kill our people, it's the death of all Europeans. Require more protection for Europe, more protection for Ukraine - as part of a democratic world. While state institutions in Europe are in no hurry with really strong decisions, every European in the capital can already come to our embassy and offer assistance. Demand from your governments more financial, more military assistance to Ukraine. For this help is a help to you. For it is a help to Europe. You help yourself. If you have a combat experience in Europe and do not want to look at the indecision of politicians, you can arrive in our state and protect Europe with us where it is now urgently required. You have already been blackmailed with gas. Already humiliated. They already want to split and divide you the same way as they are trying to divide Ukraine today. Protect yourself. Just as we protect yourself. I want to address Russian Federation President once again. Battles take place all over the territory of Ukraine. Let's sit at the negotiating table. To stop the death of people. And now I want to address the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Stand firmly. You are all we have. You are everything that protects our state. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Today was a hard yet courageous day. We are fighting for our state absolutely on all frontlines: South, East, North, in many cities of our beautiful country. Fighting around the clock on the diplomatic frontline as well - it's easier to say with whom I did not speak to among world leaders today. We continue this. I have been constantly working and spoke with President Macron, Scholz, Rutte, Mrs. von der Leyen, President of the United States Biden. I outlined what answer Ukrainians still expect from the West to this aggression and agreed on new assistance, new support, significant assistance for our state. I thank all the leaders and I am separately grateful to President Biden. I was really glad to see the news from friendly Georgia. I want to thank the good, beautiful Georgian people who went out on the streets of their country and supported Ukraine. You are true friends! Thanks. Our main goal is to end this slaughter. The enemy suffers very-very serious losses. These are hundreds, hundreds of killed soldiers who crossed our border, who came to our land. We suffer losses as well, unfortunately. Ukrainians resist the aggression heroically. It is impossible to justify. Therefore, the invaders have to come up with more and more absurd accusations to say at least something. I am convinced that these allegations are biased, nobody will believe them. Ukrainians won’t believe them, the world won’t believe them, citizens of the Russian Federation won’t believe them. It's simply cannot be such a truth that could clarify why kindergartens and housing infrastructure are fired from a missile artillery. In Vorzel, Kyiv region, they fired \"Grads\" at an orphanage. Okhtyrka, Sumy region, was shelled by \"Uragans\". Housing quarters, shelter, kindergartens were under the shelling. What is this war against Ukrainian children in a kindergarten? Who are they? Are they neo-Nazis from kindergarten as well? Or were they NATO soldiers that threatened Russia? Killed and injured children are the sentence to this invasion. Everyone, I emphasize, everyone must do everything they can to stop this war. Every day of aggression destroys normal life not only in Ukraine, but also in Russia, and in Europe, in the world. Europeans do not imagine yet what it is like to live when there is such a confrontation next to you. I have to say absolutely frankly: this night will be harder than a day. Many cities of our state are under attack. Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, our boys, our girls in Donbas, cities of the south of Ukraine. Kyiv requires special attention. We cannot lose the capital. I appeal to our defenders on all frontlines. This night the enemy will use all the forces available to break our resistance. Treacherously, viciously, inhumanly. This night they will make an assault upon us. We all have to understand what we are going to face. This night we have to withstand. The fate of Ukraine is now being decided. Each civilian should be as careful as possible. Help, please, each other, especially elderly people, lonely, those for whom it is very difficult now. In case of any danger go to the shelter. Everyone who has already joined the country's defense or can help defend, stop the enemy everywhere you can. Remove special signs that saboteurs leave on the roads and buildings. Burn the enemy’s equipment with anything you can. If even kindergartens are a permissible target for invaders, you must not leave them any chance. All thoughts, all prayers of Ukrainians are with our military. We believe in them, take care of them. Defend our state. The night will be tough, very tough. But the morning will come."

  "speech": "I can start this address with good news. We withstood and successfully repel enemy attacks. The fighting continues. In many cities and districts of our state. But we know what we are defending. The country, the land, the future of children. Kyiv and key cities around the capital are controlled by our army. The invaders wanted to block the center of our state and put their puppets here, as in Donetsk. We broke their plan. They did not gain any advantage over us. On our streets, in the skies of Kyiv, in Vasylkiv, in Vyshhorod, even in the surrounding fields, a real battle for Kyiv took place. The enemy used everything against us: missiles, fighter aircraft, drones, artillery, armored vehicles, saboteurs, paratroopers. The invaders are shelling residential neighborhoods, including with the use of missile artillery, trying to destroy energy facilities. They have very treacherous tactics. Dwellings destroyed by missiles and artillery are the ultimate argument for the world to stop the occupation invasion together with us. I say this as frankly as possible now: the people of Ukraine have already earned and have the right to become a member of the European Union. This will be the key evidence of our country's support. It is a crucial moment to close the long-standing strategic discussion once and for all and to decide on Ukraine's membership in the European Union. I discussed this today with Charles Michel, Ursula von der Leyen, Emmanuel Macron. The anti-war coalition is operating - defense weapons and equipment are heading to Ukraine. We already have almost full support from EU countries for disconnecting Russia from SWIFT. I hope that Germany and Hungary will have the courage to support this decision. We have the courage to defend our homeland, to defend Europe. In each of our cities, the invaders are being severely rebuffed. Uman, Odesa, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donbas, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv - wherever the enemy kills our people, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to stop and destroy the invaders. Lviv and other cities in western and central Ukraine that are under air attacks endure firmly. Well done! Every Ukrainian needs to remember one thing. If you can stop and destroy the invaders, do it. All those who can return to Ukraine, come back to defend Ukraine. And then we will have a lot of work with you to rebuild it! All those who can defend Ukraine abroad, do it purposefully, unitedly, continuously! All friends of Ukraine who want to join the defense - come, we will give you weapons! All the details of how to implement this will be announced in the near future. Glory to all those who defend Ukraine today! You are heroes! I adopted a decision to posthumously award the title of Hero of Ukraine to Vitaliy Volodymyrovych Skakun, a sapper of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade. At the cost of his own life, he blew up the bridge. And now I want absolutely everyone in Russia to hear me. Thousands of victims. Hundreds of prisoners who simply cannot understand why they were sent to Ukraine. Sent to be killed. The sooner you tell your government that the war must be stopped immediately, the more of your people will remain alive. We see that there are indeed protests by your citizens against the war. We know that many in Russia are now simply shocked by the meanness and cruelty of the authorities. This is a truly correct response. I thank you for this reaction. Thanks to Leonid Parfyonov, Dmitry Muratov, Yury Dud, Liya Akhedzhakova, Valery Meladze and thousands, thousands of other Russians whose conscience is heard loud. Just stop those who lie to you, lie to us, lie to the whole world. We need to end this war. We can live in peace - in global peace, in human peace. Our military, national guards, national police, territorial defense, border guards, special services, citizens - hold on! We will defeat everyone. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "These words of mine will be addressed to the citizens of Belarus. Today, all of you are called to the polls to vote in the referendum. This could look like a normal political process. But now it certainly cannot be anything normal. Now decisions are made on a completely different level. Last night in Ukraine was cruel. More shelling. More bombing of residential areas, civilian infrastructure. Today there is not a single object in the country that the invaders would not consider a valid target for themselves. They fight against everyone. They fight against everything that’s alive - against kindergartens, against residential buildings and even against ambulances. They use rocket artillery, missiles against entire urban areas in which there has never been any military infrastructure. Vasylkiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and many other cities of Ukraine are surviving in conditions that were last seen on our land and your land during the Second World War. But in the war that is going on now, you are not on the same side with us. Regretfully. From your territory, the troops of the Russian Federation launch rockets into Ukraine. Our children are being killed from your territory, our houses are being destroyed, they are trying to blow up everything that has been built over decades - and, by the way, not only by us, but also by our fathers, our grandfathers. And all this is also a de facto referendum for you, Belarusians. You decide who you are. You decide who to be. How will you look into the eyes of your children, how will you look into the eyes of each other, your neighbors. And we are your neighbors. We, Ukrainians. Be Belarus, not Russia! You are making this choice right now. Exactly today. Now there is a lot of news about possible negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, which can end this war and restore peace to all of us. And they often mention your capital. Minsk. As a platform for these negotiations. A place we didn't choose. And, in fact, you did not, too.The leadership of Russia chose it. And now, there is an offer to meet there again. Four days ago, cruise missiles, planes, helicopters and equipment came from Belarusian territory. They hit our homes, they hit our lives. The heavy equipment followed. And this is a dreadful deja vu. You know, Kyiv was attacked at 4 am. Someone has such a sense of humor, just as in 1941. You slept, Belarusian brothers. And we woke up. But you are still sleeping. And we haven't gone to bed since that moment. Because we are fighting. We are fighting for our country. We are fighting for our freedom. Because we have every right to do so. If there were no aggressive actions from your territory, we could speak in Minsk. In your city. When you were neutral, we spoke in Minsk, we met many times. This is right. This is truthful. To talk like neighbors. Right now, you haven't made your big choice yet. And it is ahead, it should depend only on you. Not on Russia, not on Ukraine, not on America, but on the people of Belarus. That is why now we say - not Minsk. The venue for the meeting may be other cities. Of course, we want peace. We want to meet, we want the end of the war! Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku - we proposed to the Russian side all of this. Any other city suits us in a country from whose territory missiles are not launched. Only in this way can negotiations be honest. And they can really end the war. I sincerely wish Belarus to once again become that kind, safe Belarus that everyone saw not so long ago. Make the right choice. I am sure this is the main choice of your great people."

  "speech": "This night was hard. What do they do? This is revenge. The people rose to defend their state, and they showed their true faces. This is terror. They are going to bomb our Ukrainian cities even more. They are going to kill our children even more insidiously. This is an evil that has come to our land and must be destroyed. They lied that they would not touch the civilian population. But since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure. They consciously chose tactics to destroy people and everything that makes life just normal. Power plants, hospitals, kindergartens, residential buildings - all this is under attack every day. What the invaders are doing to Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Kyiv, Odesa and other cities and towns deserves an international tribunal. We clearly record all their crimes. And there would have been many more of these crimes if it hadn't been for our courageous defenders. Ukrainian forces are great. Repulse attacks, breaking the enemy's plans. They do their job brilliantly. Yes, this is truly a job. A hard, fundamental, and most importantly - fair job. A job that deserves the highest appraisal and the highest gratitude. A decision was made to significantly increase the payments to our defenders. I can honestly say that it will be expensive. But there is nothing more precious than life and the struggle for our freedom and freedom of our next generations. And there are those who will help us. This is already real. We get weapons, medicine, food, diesel, money. A strong international coalition in support of Ukraine has been formed. An anti-war coalition. Here is the latest summary from the diplomatic frontline. There were very substantive talks with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the President of Georgia, the Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson. Each conversation added specifics to the defense capabilities of our state and the strength of our military. Germany has announced the supply of 1,000 anti-tank grenade launchers and 500 Stingers with additional ammunition. Belgium provides 5,000 machine guns and 5 million rounds of ammunition, and another 4,000 tons of fuel. Thanks to active diplomacy, we’ve convinced all European countries to disconnect Russia from SWIFT. We thank President of Poland Andrzej Duda for his personal leadership in granting Ukraine membership in the European Union. Poland's daily assistance to our country is also very much needed. We have to call a spade a spade. Russia's criminal actions against Ukraine show signs of genocide. I talked about this with the UN Secretary General. Russia is on the path of evil. The world must deprive Russia of the right to vote in the UN Security Council. Ukrainians! We know exactly what we are defending. We will definitely win."

  "speech": "I had a phone conversation with Alexander Lukashenko. We haven't spoken to him in two years. And today I had a long substantive conversation with him. I explained to him in detail the impossibility of our clash. I do not want missiles, planes, helicopters to fly to Ukraine from Belarus. I do not want troops to go to Ukraine from Belarus. And he assured me of that.My task as President is to protect our state. And you have seen during these tough days how we are fulfilling this task. Alexander Lukashenko called on the meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian delegations on the Pripyat River. I emphasize: without any conditions. I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as President, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance. And while our guys are there, the President is here, the Head of the Office is here, the Prime Minister is here, the army is here, the Commander-in-Chief is here. We will all defend our state and our borders. You and I must act pragmatically to achieve our goal. And our goal is our territorial integrity. You have seen our position one hundred percent. This is the unconditional protection of national statehood. As regards our motivation. It is obvious that our servicemen are fighting not for money, but for today, for tomorrow. And they provide a very tough response to what happened yesterday. But we must understand that today the most important job is to be a soldier, to defend the country. And that's why I really want the state to pay decently for this job. We will pay our armed servicemen a hundred thousand hryvnias a month. Not to hear \"thank you\" from them, but to let them know that the country is definitely grateful to them. And it will be so until this war is over. And the last thing. Yesterday, unfortunately, we lost our \"Mriya\". But the old \"Mriya\". And we are building a new one now."

  "speech": "Good morning, Ukrainian heroes! The fifth day of Russia's full-scale war against the people of Ukraine. We stand firm. During this time, we have experienced as much as other nations may not have in decades. We have been told for a long time that there is something wrong with Ukrainians in this or that issue. That Ukrainians have to do so-called \"homework\" for decades. Because of this, we often did not notice what we are really capable of. And now we have shown ourselves to the fullest. And it's inspiring. For everyone. In every conversation with our partners, I hear sincere respect. Ukrainians have shown the world who we are. And Russia has shown what it has become. Just think about it: during the Russian invasion - in just four days - sixteen Ukrainian children died as a result of the Russian shelling. Sixteen! 45 children were wounded. Every crime, every shelling that the invaders commit against us, unites us and our partners even more. Russia did not believe in such a solidary and powerful reaction. But Ukrainians have changed that story. The European Union has decided to supply us with weapons. We are grateful. Yesterday I spoke with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, about further, even stronger steps. Europeans are aware that our soldiers are fighting for our country and, consequently, for the whole of Europe. For peace for all European countries, for the lives of children, for equality, for democracy. And this gives us the full right to do the following. We appeal to the European Union for Ukraine's immediate accession under a new special procedure. We are grateful to our partners for being with us. But our goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal. I am confident that is fair. I am confident we deserve it. I am confident that all this is possible. Yesterday I spoke with the Presidents of Portugal, Lithuania, President of France Emmanuel Macron and President of Poland Andrzej Duda. I am especially grateful to Andrzej Duda for our fruitful work. I spoke with the Prime Ministers of Belgium, Spain and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. Support of our anti-war coalition is unconditional and unprecedented. Europe has closed the sky to all Russian planes. Global business refuses any ties with Russian companies. Let's see how this week will end for the Russian currency - what will be the fall of the ruble. As long as this criminal invasion of Ukraine continues, the Russian state is suffering losses as if the war passed through their territory. Do you need all this? Russian mothers, Russian teachers, Russian entrepreneurs, ordinary people. For what? Four and a half thousand Russian soldiers have already been killed. Why did you all come here? Why do the columns of your armored vehicles go against us? From our Crimea. From Yalta, Yevpatoriya, Sudak, Simferopol... These are not the names of military camps for tankers. Once again: four and a half thousand Russian invaders killed. Throw away your equipment. And leave. Do not believe your commanders. Do not believe your propagandists. Just save your lives. Leave. We dedicate every hour to strengthening our state. Anyone who can join the fight against the invaders must do so. Therefore, a decision was made - not easy from a moral point of view, but useful from the point of view of our protection. Under martial law, participants in hostilities - Ukrainians with real combat experience - will be released from custody and will be able to compensate for their guilt in the hottest spots of war. All sanctions are lifted from some people who took part in the anti-terrorist operation. The key now is defense. When I ran for presidency, I said that each of us is the President. Because we are all responsible for our state. For our beautiful Ukraine. And now it turns out that each of us is a warrior. The warrior in his or her own place. And I am confident that each of us will win."

  "speech": "Russian forces today brutally shelled Kharkiv with rocket artillery. This is definitely a military crime. A peaceful city. Peaceful residential areas. No military object. Dozens of eyewitness records prove that this is not a separate false shot, it is a conscious destruction of people. Russians knew where they were shooting. For this crime there will definitely be a tribunal. International. This is a breach of all conventions. No one in the world will forgive you the murder of peaceful Ukrainian people. Here is Ukraine. Here is Europe. Here is 2022. Evil, armed with rockets, bombs and artillery, must be stopped immediately. Destroyed economically. We must show that humanity is able to protect themselves. I believe that it is necessary to consider the full closure of the sky for Russian missiles, airplanes, helicopters. In five days of invasion, already 56 missile strikes have been carried out against Ukraine. 113 cruise missiles were fired. This is their \"fraternal friendship\". And the world knows what to do. I spoke about this with partners today. The state committing military crimes against civilians cannot be a member of the UN Security Council. The entrance to all ports, channels, airports in the world must be closed for this state. Such a state must not receive hundreds of billions for energy exports. Buying Russian goods now is to pay money for murdering people. Peaceful, proud, strong Kharkiv. You have always been such. You will always be such. We will withstand this as well. We will defend Ukraine. We will help everyone affected by inhuman invasion. Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Sumy, Hostomel, Vasylkiv, Kherson, Mariupol, Donetsk and all other cities and towns of our native country will see a peaceful and safe life. Sincere condolences to all who lost their relatives and loved ones in this war. Eternal memory to those who died. Eternal glory to everyone who defends our freedom! Before addressing you, I signed a decree on awarding the title of the Hero of Ukraine to twelve our defenders: Lieutenant  Colonel Eduard Mykolayovych Vahorovsky (posthumously). He died saving our aircraft from a missile strike. Gave others the opportunity to take to the air.  Major Dmytro Valeriyovych Kolomiets (posthumously). He rescued his brothers-in-arms, diverted enemy aircraft fire and was shot down by an enemy plane. Lieutenant Colonel Hennadiy Vasyliovych Matulyak (posthumously). Hostomel. Destroyed the group of enemy equipment. Lieutenant Vitaliy Anatoliyovych Movchan (posthumously). In an air battle he destroyed two enemy aircraft. Colonel Oleksandr Yakovych Oksanchenko (posthumously). He died in an air battle, distracting enemy aircraft. Senior Lieutenant Vyacheslav Denysovych Radionov (posthumously). Thanks to his courageous actions, the entire crew of the brigade's planes took to the air in Vasylkiv, and this saved ours from a missile strike. Senior Lieutenant Andriy Andriyovych Gerus. Over the city of Kropyvnytskyi he shot down an enemy IL-76, which prevented the landing of Russian troops with weapons. Brigadier General Dmytro Serhiyovych Krasylnykov, Commander of the Operational and Tactical Group \"North\". For two days he has been fighting off the continuous assault, saved people and equipment. And did not let the enemy into Kharkiv from the Luhansk region. Lieutenant Colonel Andriy Mykolayovych Kruhlov. He withdrew the Buk SAM unit from the enemy attacks and personally destroyed two Russian helicopters and one plane. Colonel Oleksandr Volodymyrovych Mostov. He shot down a Russian IL-76 near Vasylkiv, as well as two Mi-24 helicopters, which prevented the landing of paratroopers and weapons. Lieutenant General Yuri Ivanovych Sodol. In the battles for Volnovakha, he saved our men from the encirclement and organized a successful counterattack. He brought people out of the enemy’s attack. Defends Mariupol extremely effectively. Colonel of medical service Eduard Mykolayovych Khoroshun. He personally organized the defense of the besieged military medical center and carried out the evacuation of the wounded. Now about Kyiv, our beautiful capital, the basis of our state, our security. For an enemy, Kyiv is the key target. They want to break our national statehood. Therefore, the capital is constantly in danger. Three rocket-bombing strikes are carried out only today. TETs-6 is the target. They want to damage a power station and leave our city without light. We did not allow them to break the defense of the capital. And they send saboteurs to us. Constantly. Hundreds. All they are being neutralized. In addition to defense, we are thinking about the rear as well. Provide people with everything necessary. We formed a round-the-clock coordination headquarters that collects all requests from regional administrations regarding the lack of the most necessary stuff. Products, medicines, fuel, equipment. The headquarters directly  finds suppliers that can quickly and qualitatively meet such needs. This is the restoration of supply chains, interrupted by the war. Today, at the initiative of the Russian side, the first round of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia took place. These negotiations took place against the background of bombing and shelling of our territory, our cities. Synchronization of shelling with a negotiation process could be seen. I believe that Russia is trying to put pressure on us in such a way. Don't waste time. We do not perceive such tactics. Fair negotiations are possible when one side does not hit the other side with rocket artillery precisely at the moment of negotiations. So far we do not have the result we would like to get. Russia has declared its position. We have outlined positions in response - to end the war. Some signals we received. When the delegation returns to Kyiv, we will analyze what we’ve heard and then determine how to move to the second round of negotiations. Another thing that is very important to say. We've been waiting 30 years for this. Today I signed an application for Ukraine's membership in the European Union. We have gained the right to be together with everyone in Europe. The application has already been delivered to Brussels, officially registered. The time has come."

  "speech": "Kharkiv. A cruise missile strike. At the largest square of Europe. Freedom Square. Dozens of victims. This is what the price of freedom is. This is what the morning of the people of Ukraine is. Ukrainian Kharkiv and Russian Belgorod have always been close cities. In many ways. Even the border between them was only conditional, only on maps, but not in the soul. Not in the soul. Now everything has changed. After the cruise missile that struck Kharkiv from Belgorod. The missile that hit Freedom Square. The face of our Kharkiv. This is terror against the city. There was no military target on the square. Just as in those residential areas of Kharkiv hit by rocket artillery. The rocket aimed at the central square is an outright, undisguised terror. No one will forgive. No one will forget. This attack on Kharkiv is a war crime. This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation. After that, Russia is a terrorist state. Obviously. And it must be official. We call on all countries of the world to respond immediately and effectively to this criminal tactic of the aggressor and to declare that Russia is committing state terrorism. We demand full responsibility for terrorists in international courts. Kharkiv and Kyiv are currently the most important targets for Russia. Terror is meant to break us. To break our resistance. They are heading to our capital, as well as to Kharkiv. Therefore, the defense of the capital today is the key priority for the state. All cities of Ukraine must do everything to stop the enemy. The military and civilian authorities of each city are responsible for this. But Kyiv is special. If we protect Kyiv, we will protect the state. This is the heart of our country. And it must keep beating. And it will keep beating. So that life triumphs. Dear Kyiv residents! Defense of the capital is above all. That's why I decided to appoint a professional military person as the Head of the Kyiv City Military Administration for the period of war. To guarantee the defense of the city. To block the enemy's approaches to our capital. To ensure that the people of Kyiv have everything they need. The Head of the Military Administration will be General Mykola Mykolayovych Zhyrnov, who served as commander of the support forces. At a high level he organized the engineering support of combat operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2014-2015. He is currently a state expert of the Military Security Service at the National Security and Defense Council. Vitali Klitschko remains mayor of Kyiv. He will have his own sphere of responsibility. And now it is a joint work of the mayor and the Head of the Military Administration. After the war, we will return everything to its place in the capital. Regarding our diplomats. Right now, our diplomats are implementing fair and absolutely necessary decisions in relation to those states that have betrayed their word and international law. We immediately recall the Ambassador from Kyrgyzstan for consultations. For justifying aggression against Ukraine. We immediately recall the Ambassador from Georgia. For the obstacles to volunteers who want to help us. For an immoral attitude towards sanctions. And now I want to speak about those whose feat is an example of the highest moral strength. These are our doctors. You save people around the clock. Always. And now your work is one of the key lines of our defense. You keep it brilliant. Thousands of lives have been saved in 5 days. I am also grateful to everyone who provides our people with everything they need for life in these extremely difficult conditions. Food, energy, medicine. And I thank the ordinary people of Ukraine, who stop tanks with their bare hands, expel the invaders from administrative buildings by force of spirit and make their stay in Ukraine shameful. To prove that they are all strangers here. This is what the people's war is. This is what the people of Ukraine is."

  "speech": "Good health to you, united country! I did not accidentally say \"united\". The seventh day of this terrible war began. A war we feel the same way. During this time we have had more unity than for over thirty years before. At first we were equally scared, then we felt equally painful. And now we do not care. Except for victory. Except for the truth. Except for peace. Except for the tranquility we want to achieve. Except for the lives of our people, for whom we are worried. Except for Ukraine. During this time, we have truly become one. We forgave each other a lot. We started loving each other. We help each other. We are worried for each other. Yesterday morning on Freedom Square we were all Kharkiv residents. Then the enemy destroyed us all by striking at residential buildings in Borodyanka. We were all bombed in Kyiv last night. And we all died again in Babyn Yar - from a missile strike. Although the whole world promises constantly - never again. For any normal person who knows history, Babyn Yar is a special part of Kyiv. A special part of Europe. A place of prayer. A place of remembrance for the hundred thousand people killed by the Nazis. The place of old Kyiv cemeteries. Who should you be to make it a target for missiles? You are killing Holocaust victims for the second time. During the Soviet era, a TV center was built on the bones there. And also a sports complex. Outbuildings. They built a park there. To erase the true history of Babyn Yar. But why was it bombed? This is beyond humanity. Such a missile strike shows that for many people in Russia, our Kyiv is completely foreign. They know nothing about our capital. About our history. But they have an order to erase our history. Erase our country. Erase us all. On the first day of the war, Uman was brutally bombed, where hundreds of thousands of Jews come every year to pray. Then - Babyn Yar, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were executed. I am now addressing all the Jews of the world - don't you see what is happening? That is why it is very important that millions of Jews around the world do not remain silent right now. Nazism is born in silence. So shout about the killings of civilians. Shout about the killings of Ukrainians. Last night and tonight they continued to bomb our cities. Bombs. Missiles. Artillery. Machine guns. Targeting peaceful people. Again. Targeting residential areas. Again. Mariupol, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr and other cities and towns of Ukraine. This cannot be explained by any human reason. Any reason of God. What then, if Babyn Yar was attacked? What other military facilities threaten Russia? What other “NATO bases”? Saint Sophia Cathedral? Lavra? St. Andrew's Church? Whatever they dream of there - damn them! Because God is with us! During this time, we have united the European Union already on a new level. Higher than formal. Higher than interstate. At the level of ordinary people. Millions and millions of Europeans. From the Atlantic Ocean to the suburbs of Kharkiv, where fierce fighting continues. When the European Parliament stood and applauded us, our struggle, it was an assessment of our efforts. Our unity. Six days of war like thirty years. That is why the European Union answers \"yes\" to us. We have started a special accelerated accession procedure. Our diplomats and our friends unite the world for the sake of Ukraine and peace even more. Neutral Switzerland has supported EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs, officials, the state and companies. Once again: neutral Switzerland! So what do some other countries expect? Our anti-war coalition has already been joined by the countries that Moscow relied on a week ago. This is an extraordinary result. You can't stay neutral right now! And what is the result for Russia? The flag of this state will no longer be seen in sports tournaments. Modern world culture will now be closed to them. Russian goods are being removed from store shelves around the world. Russian banks are disconnected from the global system. Russian citizens are losing their savings, losing all prospects. Russian mothers are losing their children in a completely foreign country. Think of this number: almost six thousand Russians died. Russian military. In six days of war. This is without counting the losses of the enemy last night. Six thousand. To get what? Get Ukraine? It is impossible. This is not to be changed by missiles. Bombs. Tanks. Any blows. We are on our native land. And for the war against us there will be an International Tribunal for them. Ukrainians! Another night of Russia's full-scale war against us, against the people, has passed. Hard night. Someone spent that night in the subway - in a shelter. Someone spent it in the basement. Someone was luckier and slept at home. Others were sheltered by friends and relatives. We’ve hardly slept for seven nights. Or we sleep, but anxiously. My dears, the time will come when we will be able to sleep. But it will be after the war. After the victory. In a peaceful country, as we need. Which we have always appreciated. And which we have never destroyed. I ask all of you to take care of your loved ones. Take care of your brothers-in-arms. I admire you! The whole world admires you. From Hollywood stars to politicians. Today you, Ukrainians, are a symbol of invincibility. A symbol that people in any country can become the best people on earth at any moment."

  "speech": "Good health to you, dear Ukrainians! Strong and kind! But – kind NOT to enemies. We are a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week. Plans that have been built for years. Treacherously. Deliberately. With hatred of our country, of our people - of any people who have heart and freedom. But we stopped them. We beat them. Our military, border guards, territorial defense. Even ordinary farmers capture the Russian military on a daily basis. And they all say one thing: they don't know why they're here. Despite the fact that their quantity is ten times bigger, the morale of the enemy is deteriorating. More and more invaders are fleeing back to Russia. From us. From you. From all who drive out the enemy with javelins, stugnas, guns, tanks, planes, helicopters. Everything that shoots. But Ukrainians are beating the enemy even without weapons. I sincerely admire the heroic civilians of Konotop, Bashtanka, Energodar, Melitopol. Other towns and villages. Who do not let the invaders in by blocking the roads. People come out in front of enemy vehicles. This is extremely dangerous. But this is brave. It is also salvation. I'm sure you saw a video from Melitopol where Ukrainians protested against Russians who entered our city. Temporarily. I am sure of this: if they entered somewhere, it is only temporarily. We’ll drive them out. With shame. As those people, ordinary people who drive the invaders out of grocery stores when the Russian soldiers are trying to find food do. These are not warriors of the superpower. These are confused children who were used. Take them home. Ukrainians! Every invader should know: they will not get anything here. No one will be conquered. Even if they can accumulate more equipment and more people, it doesn't change anything for them. Wherever they enter. They will be destroyed everywhere. They will not have peace. They will have no food. They will not have a single quiet moment. The invaders will receive only a rebuff from Ukrainians. Fierce rebuff. Such a rebuff that they will forever remember that we will not give up what’s ours. That they will remember what the patriotic war is. Yes, for us it is a patriotic war. We remember how patriotic wars begin. And we know how they end. For the invaders. Our army is doing everything to break the enemy completely. Almost nine thousand Russians were killed! In one week! In the Mykolaiv direction invaders have to take away the \"two hundred\" and \"three hundred\" with tens of helicopters. 19 years, 20 years ... What did they see in life, apart from this invasion? But most of them remain everywhere. Ukraine does not want to be covered with military corpses. Go home. Your whole army. Tell your commanders that you want to live. Not to die. To live. The war must be stopped and peace restored as soon as possible. Today was, as usual, an active day of negotiations with the leaders of the member states of our anti-war coalition. I held talks with the heads of government of Norway and Israel. With the President of Kazakhstan. With the Emir of Qatar Tamim Bin Hamad al Thani. With President of the European Council Charles Michel. With Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. With President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Brilliant result at the UN General Assembly. 141 countries supported the resolution, which calls on Russia to withdraw troops from Ukraine immediately. 141 states stand for us! And for Russia - only four states that voted against. Here is the list: North Korea, Eritrea, Syria and Belarus. This is the list. These are the friends. And there will be no others for the state that does not know how to live in peace. Today I held a meeting with the heads of regions and cities of Ukraine. The new head of the Odesa regional state administration is already working. Maksym Marchenko. Military. Professional. Our guys on the ground are working hard to organize \"green corridors\". To take out civilians. To bring medicine. Volnovakha, cities of the Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv regions, south of Ukraine. This is very difficult. Extremely difficult. We are opposed by terror. But terror loses. Thanks to our heroes. Today I signed a decree awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to fifteen of our defenders: Senior Lieutenant Maksym Vitaliyovych Bilokon. Posthumously. He took part in repelling the enemy's attack during the defense of Chernihiv, destroyed the enemy's subversive group and two enemy tanks. Lieutenant Colonel Oleksandr Valeriyovych Kapichun. Posthumously. Thanks to his heroic actions, the enemy column was stopped, equipment and enemy soldiers were destroyed. Soldier Oleksandr Volodymyrovych Lukyanovych. Posthumously. During the battle he neutralized up to three dozen units of enemy equipment. He was fatally wounded by an air strike. Junior Sergeant Mykhailo Mykhailovych Nesolyony. Posthumously. He died in close combat with enemy forces while evacuating people. Soldier Andriy Valeriyovych Nikonchuk. Posthumously. He protected the Kyiv HPP from Russian air raids and missile strikes. Lieutenant Vitalii Romanoviyh Sapyl. Posthumously. Tank platoon commander. Neutralized three dozen enemy vehicles. Killed by an air strike. Chief Sergeant Oleksiy Oleksandrovych Senyuk. Posthumously. He defended Chernihiv, destroyed two enemy IFVs and captured a T-72 tank. Killed by an air strike. Lieutenant Vladyslav Petrovych Ukrainets. Posthumously. He covered the retreat of brothers-in-arms when the enemy attacked. Major Stepan Ivanovych Choban. Posthumously. The pilot of the Su-27, distracted the enemy aircraft over Kropyvnytskyi. Major Ihor Vasyliovych Mykhalchuk. Head of the tank battalion unit. Destroyed numerous enemy armored vehicles. Colonel Serhiy Mykolayovych Musienko. Head of the Missile and Artillery Division. Inflicted devastating blows on the enemy in the Kharkiv direction. Lieutenant Yevhen Mykhailovych Palchenko. Tank platoon commander. Covered the exit of the brigade from the encirclement. Major Vladyslav Yuriyovych Prokopenko. Head of the tank battalion. Withdrew personnel and equipment from the encirclement without loss. Lieutenant Colonel Pavlo Yuriyovych Fedosenko. Head of the unit of the 92nd brigade. For the effective defense of Kharkiv. Senior Lieutenant Dmytro Petrovych Chavalakh. For heroic participation in the defense of the Kherson region. All 40 million are like these fifteen heroes!"

  "speech": "Exactly two years ago, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded in Ukraine. The first weeks of fighting it were extremely difficult. But we were united, and therefore strong, and therefore we withstood. Exactly a week ago, Ukraine was attacked by another virus. Another disease. By those who suffer from severe annexation and occupation of foreign lands. One week ago, at 4 am, Russia invaded our independent Ukraine, our land. Acute fit of aggression, megalomania, delusion of persecution. Heavy psychological complexes and as a result - missile systems. Rocket artillery. Tanks and other armored vehicles - simply like locusts. The first hours and days of full-scale war were extremely difficult. But we were united, and therefore strong, and therefore we withstood. And it will be so. And we will continue to stand. We stand so that the invaders were forced to change tactics. Russia's missile and bomb strikes at Ukrainian cities are a confession that they could not do anything significant on land. All lines of our defense are preserved. The enemy has no success in any of the strategic directions. They are demoralized. They are doomed. Kyiv survived this night and withstood another missile and bomb strike. Our air defense worked. Kherson, Izyum, all other cities where the invaders carried out strikes from the air, did not give up anything. Chernihiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv hold the line. Odesa. They also want to destroy Odesa. But they will see only the bottom of the Black Sea. The target of Russia was the Assumption Cathedral in Kharkiv. One of the oldest Orthodox monuments of the city, monuments of Ukraine. During the war, the cathedral is a shelter for Kharkiv residents. Shelter for all people: believers and non-believers. For everyone, because everyone is equal. Holy place. Now it is damaged by war. They are not afraid of even that! They enjoy the fact that God does not give an instant rebuff. But he sees. And he answers. Answers so that you cannot hide. There is no such bunker to survive God's response. And we will restore the cathedral so that no trace of war remains there. And even if you destroy all our cathedrals and churches, you will not destroy our sincere faith in God, in Ukraine. Faith in people. We will restore every house, every street, every city. And we say to Russia: learn the words \"reparations\" and \"contributions\". You will repay everything you did against Ukraine. In full. And we will not forget those who perished, and God won’t. You have come to destroy our cities. Destroy our people. Take away from us everything that is dear to us. You cut off electricity, water and heating to civilians in Ukraine. You leave people without food and medicine. You are shelling routes of possible evacuation. There is no weapon that you would not use against us, against the free citizens of Ukraine. And now you are telling your propagandists that you are going to send so-called humanitarian columns to Ukraine... Remember, godless men: when millions of people curse you, you have nothing to save yourself. Ukrainians in all war-torn regions will receive everything they need from us. Coordination headquarters are working in full. Real humanitarian goods are on the way. Our government has already prepared a program of special assistance for all Ukrainians who have lost the opportunity to work. Now. Because of the war. Where there is fighting! Every employee, every sole proprietor, every citizen of ours, from whom Russia has taken away the opportunity to work, will receive six and a half thousand hryvnias without any conditions. I especially emphasize this for older Ukrainians. Despite the war, we ensure full payment of pensions. Indexed pensions. As it should be in accordance with the law. From March 1, pensions for Ukrainians are indexed by 14%. The money has already gone to the banks. All payments will be made in full. Ukraine receives weapons from its partners on a daily basis. From real friends. More and more powerful weapons every day. Ukraine is already meeting foreign volunteers who are going to our country. The first of sixteen thousand. They are going to defend freedom. Defend life. For us. For all. And it will be successful. I'm sure. We have survived in our history and on our land two world wars, three Holodomors, the Holocaust, Babyn Yar, the Great Terror, the Chornobyl explosion, the occupation of Crimea and the war in the east. We do not have a huge territory - from ocean to ocean, we do not have nuclear weapons, we do not fill the world market with oil and gas. But we have our people and our land. And for us - it's gold. That is what we are fighting for. We have nothing to lose but our own freedom and dignity. For us, this is the greatest treasure. They wanted to destroy us so many times. They failed. They wanted to wipe us off the face of the earth. They failed. They backstabbed us. And we are on our feet. They wanted us to be silent. But the whole world heard us. We've been through so much! And if someone thinks that, having overcome all this, Ukrainians - all of us - are scared, broken or will surrender, he knows nothing about Ukraine. And he has nothing to do in Ukraine. Go home. To your home. Protect Russian-speaking people. Not all over the world. In your country. There are almost 150 million of them. And here..."

  "speech": "People of Ukraine! We have survived the night that could have stopped history. History of Ukraine. History of Europe. Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The largest in Europe. It alone could be like six Chornobyls. Russian tankers knew what they were firing at. Direct aiming at the station. This is terror of an unprecedented level. There are 15 nuclear units in Ukraine. And the Russian servicemen have completely forgotten about Chornobyl. About this world tragedy. Russian people, I want to address you. How is that even possible? Together in 1986 we struggled with the consequences of the Chornobyl disaster. You must remember the burning graphite scattered by the explosion. Victims. You must remember the glow above the destroyed power unit. You must remember the evacuation from Pripyat and the 30 km zone. How could you forget it? And if you have not forgotten, then you cannot be silent. You must tell your authorities, go to the streets and say that you want to live. To live on earth without radioactive contamination. Radiation does not know where the border of Russia is. All night I was in touch with partners, with the leaders of other countries, so that the world could react. I felt that the world leaders were shocked. Britain is convening a UN Security Council over the attack. The IAEA is launching its 24-Hour Incident and Emergency Center. Immediate sanctions against the nuclear terrorist state are needed. Immediate closure of the sky over Ukraine is needed, because only this can guarantee that Russia will not strike at least missiles and air bombs at nuclear facilities. I am grateful to our heroes from the National Guard who guarded the station and tried to stop the enemy. I am grateful to the rescuers who extinguished the fire. But a lot depends on the common people of Energodar. You understand the threat to the station better than anyone else. You live there. Next to it. And you see the invaders directly. Drive them away. Let them know that Energodar is Ukraine. That Ukraine is not a place for nuclear ashes. Ukrainians! The enemy has brought the vast majority of its troops into the territory of our state. Almost the entire Russian army is thrown against our people. But the heroic resistance of Ukrainians has been saving our country from this invasion for the ninth day. Ukrainian cities have not seen such inhuman cruelty since the Nazi occupation. Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Mariupol. They are purposefully destroying civilian infrastructure. Destroying people. Residential neighborhoods. Just yesterday, Russian bombs killed 47 people in Chernihiv. Peaceful people. Kharkiv... Kharkiv is simply being destroyed by rocket artillery and air strikes. Russia. Destroys. Kharkiv. How could this happen? This morning in Zhytomyr, the rocket hit the school building. Hit children. This is the reality when “fraternal” Russia comes. Yesterday, during talks in Belarus, we managed to agree on the creation of humanitarian corridors where people suffer the most. Today we will see whether the agreement works. Our defense inflicts maximum losses on the enemy. Almost 9,200 invaders were killed. As of the morning of the ninth day of the war. We beat them near Mykolaiv. We beat them near Kharkiv. We beat them near Kyiv. The capital remains a key target for the invaders. But they will not break us, they will not break our statehood. Never. No matter what they do, they will still lose. Because we are at home. We are on our own land. They are constantly preparing provocations. A provocation is being prepared in Kherson. They are going to put up a performance of a kind of rally for Russia. To do this, they brought strangers to the city. They are looking for local traitors. They want to make a TV picture as if Kherson is no longer Ukrainian. I want to remind you that this is how they started the so-called \"DPR\" and \"LPR\". You understand what happened to them later. This must be stopped. Kherson residents, show that this is your city. You can stop everything, any plan of the invaders. Do not listen to anyone - listen to your children, listen to your heart. You are Ukrainians. I urge Kherson residents to get rid of any despair. Ukraine will not give up what is ours. We are fighting against a powerful enemy that outnumbers us. Which outnumbers us in the amount of equipment. But which is thousands of light years away from normal people who have dignity. Show it. Our national flag. Our national anthem. Our national spirit. Be sure to let the occupiers know that they can only be in Kherson temporarily. And they will never be able to own Kherson. Like any other city in Ukraine. Let the occupiers know that they can only stay in Kherson temporarily. And they will never be able to own your city, Kherson. Like any other Ukrainian city - the city of our state."

  "speech": "A country of power. A country of freedom. The people of absolute moral leadership. We have endured nine days of darkness. Nine days of evil. This is three times more than darkness and evil expected. We responded to the invasion as we can in times of greatest danger. Responded with heroism. Solidarity. Mutual assistance. We responded in Ukrainian. So that the history of Europe will remember it forever. It will tell children about it. Show it to grandchildren. The whole continent will know the city of Kharkiv. The city of Chernihiv. The city of Sumy. The city of Volnovakha. The city of Mariupol. The city of Mykolaiv. And many other of our beautiful cities. Living cities! Cities that have withstood the worst invasion since World War II. I say this specifically as a fait accompli. Withstood. No matter what the situation is at the moment, strategically, everything is clear. Ukrainians are united from Uzhhorod to Kharkiv, from Kyiv to Kherson. Ukrainians are chasing the enemy near Kyiv. They are beating him for Okhtyrka. Punishing him for Hostomel. They will take revenge for Kherson. Our Kherson! Ukrainian Kherson. Which they tried to humiliate today. They failed. They were not allowed. Ukrainians have shown themselves. They did not allow themselves to be deceived in a cheap cynical show. With a handout instead of help. With propaganda instead of sincerity. Russian propagandists thought of our people as of themselves. And they saw that Kherson residents are proud. And respect themselves. Respect Ukraine. I understand how difficult the decision is. When in the occupation they come out against armed enemies. I feel how risky it is. But I see how our people refuse to play by the rules of the invaders. How our people remain Ukrainians. How our people stay with our state, even temporarily finding themselves in the darkness. If Russian politicians still have their eyes, they will be able to see what Ukraine is. What our freedom is. The invaders thought they could turn off our television to Ukrainians. Our connection. They thought they could take away products, shut off the electricity. They thought it would force Ukrainians to submit. But even if you deprive us of oxygen, we will breathe deeply, to say: get out of our land! Even in complete darkness we see the truth. And we will fight until it darkens in our eyes. Because we are the warriors of light. And today no one on Earth will be able to say that this line is pathos. The 9th day of the war. Many of us have a tradition to remember those who are not with us on the 9th day. Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Unfortunately, today there is a complete impression that it is time to give a funeral repast for something else: Security guarantees and promises. Determination of alliances. Values that seem to be dead for someone. The NATO summit took place today. Weak summit. Confused summit. Summit, which shows that not everyone considers the struggle for freedom to be Europe's number one goal. All NATO intelligence offices are well aware of the enemy's plans. They also confirmed that Russia wants to continue the offensive. As best it can. For 9 days we have seen a brutal war. They are destroying our cities. They are shelling our people, our children, and residential neighborhoods. Churches. Schools. They destroy everything that ensures a normal life. And they want to continue it. Knowing that new strikes and casualties are inevitable, NATO deliberately decided NOT to close the sky over Ukraine. We believe that NATO countries themselves have created a narrative that the closure of the sky over Ukraine would provoke Russia's direct aggression against NATO. This is self-hypnosis. Of those who are weak, underconfident. Internally. Although they may have weapons many times more powerful than ours. You had to think about people. About humanity itself. And what did you think about at that summit? All the people who will die starting from this day will also die because of you. Because of your weakness. Because of your disunity. All the Alliance has managed to do so far is to carry fifty tons of diesel fuel for Ukraine through its procurement system. Probably so that we can burn the Budapest Memorandum. To make it burn better. But it is already burnt for us. In the fire of Russian troops. Is this NATO we wanted? Is this the Alliance you were building? Today, the Alliance's leadership gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities by refusing to make a no-fly zone. You could close our sky. But… I do not know who you can protect and whether you can protect NATO countries. You will not be able to buy us off with liters of fuel for liters of our blood. Shed for our common Europe. For our common freedom. For our common future. But I am also grateful to our country's friends in NATO. There are many countries of our friends, our partners - most of the powerful partners. Those who help our state no matter what. From the first day of the invasion. And I'm sure, until the victory. And that's why we do NOT feel alone. We continue to fight. We will protect our state. We will liberate our land. Thanks to our heroes. I awarded decorations and medals to 76 Ukrainian heroes for personal courage and selfless actions for our defense. Unfortunately, 37 of them are awarded posthumously. I awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to Lieutenant General Oleksandr Oleksiyovych Pavliuk, Commander of the Joint Forces Operation. I conferred the military rank of Brigadier General on Colonel Volodymyr Vasyliovych Shvorak, Deputy Commander of the East Operational Command of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I conferred the military rank of Brigadier General of Justice on Colonel of Justice Serhiy Mykolayovych Melnyk, Head of the Military Law Institute of the Yaroslav the Wise National Law University. I conferred the military rank of Brigadier General on Colonel Artem Yevhenovych Bohomolov, Deputy Commander of the West Operational Command. I conferred the military rank of General on Valerii Fedorovych Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine."

  "speech": "It is already the tenth day of our national struggle. Sincere faith. And round-the-clock work. The tenth day is like one infinitely long day. One infinitely long night that does not allow us to have a rest. Today is Saturday. Saturday. This word means nothing during the war. Like Monday or Thursday or any other day. They all became the same. We still protect the state. We still save people. The country does not know weekends anymore. It doesn't matter what time it is. It doesn't matter what date it is. And it will be so until victory. Late at night I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron. And with President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Our interaction is constant. Our conversations are daily. I am immensely grateful to each of them. I am immensely grateful to Andrzej for his determination and devotion to our common cause. Protection of people. I am grateful to Andrzej's wife - Agata. They are friends whom I sincerely consider friends and sincerely wish to everyone. We managed to prevent a humanitarian crisis at the border. We managed to organize the situation so that thousands and thousands of Ukrainian women and children were treated decently. Nobody asks about their nationality, faith or how much money they have. In fact, we no longer have a border with Poland. Because we are together on the side of good. We do not have time for borders. I am sure that soon we will be able to tell our people: come back! Come back from Poland, Romania, Slovakia and all other countries. Come back, because there is no more threat. We are already thinking about the future. For all Ukrainians. After the war. About how to revive our cities. How to revive the economy. I spoke with World Bank President David Malpass, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. We have an agreement among the largest financial institutions to support Ukraine. There is already a decision on emergency aid and tens of billions of dollars for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. And these are only the first decisions. I emphasize these are only the first. I spoke with Turkish President Erdoğan. I spoke with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. I spoke with President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. The main topic is EU membership for Ukraine. I am grateful to Europeans - hundreds of thousands of people in different cities of our continent. Bratislava, Vilnius, Frankfurt, Lyon, Paris, Tbilisi, Prague. They came out yesterday in support of Ukraine. In support of Europe. They came out for peace to be reached as soon as possible. I am grateful to Americans for the unwavering bipartisan majority of ordinary people. We saw the poll. We saw the opinion of ordinary people in America who support ordinary people in Ukraine. Who demand tougher sanctions against Russia for aggression already now. Who support closing the sky now to save the lives of our people. 74 percent of Americans stand for the no-fly zone. 74! The vast majority. What else is needed to make a decision? We are sure that the result is similar in other democratic countries. The Armed Forces of Ukraine bravely hold all key areas of our defense. They are counterattacking the invaders near Kharkiv - defending the city. They are holding the line in Mykolaiv. Kyiv, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Donbas. We inflict losses on the invaders they have not seen in their worst dreams. The Russian army has not reached the planned frontiers. Yet it has reached almost 10 thousand Russian soldiers killed. 10 thousand. This is dreadful! 18-year-old, 20-year-old boys. Very young, almost children. Soldiers who were not even explained why they were going to fight. For what and why they are in a foreign land.  10 thousand. Russia could definitely give these people something else. Instead of death. The Ukrainian people are resisting even where the invaders managed to pass. Unfortunately. But not for long. I admire every Ukrainian who is not silent. Who protests. Who takes the national flag and shows the Russian military that they will lose. They will definitely lose. Because it is impossible to win against people who stop military equipment without weapons in their hands. Who refuse to take anything from the hands of the invaders. Whose situation is tough and dangerous. But they do not lose their dignity. And will never lose it. At the talks in Belarus, the groups agreed on the first step. To bring back at least one percent of humanity from the normal level. Surrounded cities that are being destroyed and experiencing the worst days. Humanitarian corridors must work today. Mariupol and Volnovakha. To save people. Women, children, the elderly. To give food and medicine to those who remain. Our help is already on the way. Everyone who needs help should be able to leave. Those who are willing. Everyone who can defend their city must continue to fight. Must. Because if everyone leaves, then whose city will it be? We are doing everything - on our part - to make the agreement work. This is one of the main tasks for today. Let's see if we can go further. In the negotiation process. Let’s pray for our military. Let’s help our civilians. Let’s work for peace."

  "speech": "You are now at the height of your spirit. At the maximum of possibilities. Every soldier on the lines of defense. Every doctor who saves lives. Every firefighter who extinguishes fire. Every entrepreneur who continues to work. Dozens and dozens of other professions. Millions of people, which became one whole. Superpower of the spirit. Programmers who joined the information troops. Everyone who joined the territorial defense. Teachers and educators who do not leave children. Police officers. Civil servants. We all withstood the blow together. We will all rebuild our state together. What gives us this confidence? Where is it from? It's not just words. It's not just faith. This is our reality. Unconditional reality. Which is fueled by the energy of our people everyday. Our resistance. Our protest. Kherson. Melitopol. Berdyansk. Konotop. The reality of all cities and towns, rural communities that expel the invaders everyday. By their determination. By their unity. Freedom Square in Kherson is the whole of Ukraine. The streets of Konotop, where locals are shouting at the invaders, are Ukraine. Ukraine, which we know, love, protect and will not give up to any enemy. It is a special heroism to protest when your city is occupied. Even temporarily. When you don't have a weapon and in response you receive gunshots. And you don't run. When you don't have armor and an armored personnel carrier is coming at you. And you do not move aside. That is why the occupation is temporary! It is artificial. Our people, our Ukrainians do not retreat. Do not give up. Do not stop the resistance. They shout to the occupiers - go home. Like a Russian ship! They drive them away from our territory. They block the roads for them. Every meter of our Ukrainian land won by protest and humiliation of the invaders is a step forward, a step towards victory for our entire state. This is a chance to live. Ukrainians! In all our cities where the enemy entered. Feel it. Go on the offensive! You need to go outside! You have to fight! Every time when there is an opportunity. As in Kherson. As in Berdyansk. As in Melitopol. As in Konotop. You need to go out and drive this evil out of our cities. To prevent the creation of new DPR and LPR where normal life is simply impossible. Only slavery. Only on the knees. Donbas! Remember what they said about you: Nobody put Donbas on its knees! And no one will be able to do that! Everyone in Donetsk and Luhansk knows these words. They were often repeated. Earlier. What about today? Donbas, today is the time! We appeal to all people in the temporarily occupied territory. To all who hear us. Whose memory has not been erased by propaganda. Whose eyes have not been closed by fear. Whose soul has not been mutilated by cynicism. Fight for your rights! For your freedom. For Ukraine. Together with Kherson. Together with Berdyansk. Together with Kyiv and all other Ukrainian cities that value life and are not afraid of anything. I know that many of you believed that Ukraine allegedly hates you. Will allegedly attack you. Will allegedly destroy you. Liars on Russian TV talk about it every day. Liars. It's their job to lie to you every day. But this should not be your destiny. Just compare Donetsk after 8 years of war and Kharkiv after 8 days of war. You were told that we are destroying cities. Look at Kharkiv. At Chernihiv. At 500 kg bombs that were dropped on the houses of Ukrainians. They were killing us. They were killing children. Look at Borodyanka. Look at the destroyed schools. At the blown up kindergartens. At the damaged Kharkiv Assumption Cathedral. Look what Russia has done. It did it right in front of your eyes. Protect yourself! Otherwise, it will take your life, too. Your houses. Ukraine does not shoot its people. We do not blow up residential buildings. And everyone in Donbas has always been and will be our people. Our citizens. In Donetsk. Luhansk. Kherson. Berdyansk. Melitopol. Konotop. In all our cities. In all cities of our state. In Ukraine."

  "speech": "I will start with the words of support I hear from our partners. From our friends. Very important words of support backed by concrete steps. Every day and every night I talk to the leaders of many countries, to the leaders of the business community. During all the days of the war, there is almost no hour when Ukraine does not hear what help it will receive. I talked about it again with President Biden last night. I am grateful to him for his determination. For preparing more new solutions for Ukrainians and Europeans. More new sanctions against aggression! And before that I spoke with American congressmen. More than two hundred representatives of both parties of the Congress. They are very sincere. They are fully interested in really helping us, providing concrete assistance. These are conversations that increase our confidence. Because one who is on the side of light will never fall into darkness. The world has the power to close our sky from Russian missiles. From Russian combat aircraft, helicopters. If anyone still doubts, Ukraine needs planes. In fact, it's simple. When you have the will. To make the sky safe. The sky of Ukraine. The sky of Europe. I spoke with the Prime Minister of Australia. And I am grateful to Australians for their moral stance on Russian exports. There must be no port where a terrorist state can make money. The Prime Ministers of Albania, Bulgaria and Israel. Support for Ukraine. Inspirational conversation with Elon Musk. With a man who creates rockets for the future. Instead of killing with rockets for the sake of the past. We talked about how to win now. About how we will cooperate later. After the victory. Support for Ukraine from global business, from the leaders of the most advanced companies is no less important than support from leading countries. When the corporate world stands by you and is not afraid, you have double protection. Triple weaponry. You have a future. Ukrainians! We have already gained our future. But we are still fighting for our present. It is very important. We are fighting for where the border will be. Between life and slavery. And this is not only our choice. The citizens of Russia are making exactly the same choice right now. These days. During these hours. Between life and slavery. Today. Tomorrow. In the coming week. This is the time when it is still possible to defeat evil without irreparable losses. When for a position they threaten with dismissal or a paddy wagon, not with the Gulag. With material losses but not with execution. Don't miss this opportunity. Social networks, friends, acquaintances, colleagues and relatives. You must be heard! We, Ukrainians, want peace! Citizens of Russia! For you, this is a struggle not only for peace in Ukraine! This is a fight for your country. For the best it had. For the freedom that you have seen. For the wealth that you have felt. If you keep silent now, then only your poverty will speak for you later. And only repression will answer it. Do not be silent! The Russian servicemen who were taken captive by our defenders started speaking. Hundreds and hundreds of prisoners. Among them are the pilots of the planes that bombed our cities. Our peaceful people. We heard their testimony. We saw the documents. Maps. Plans. Elaborated NOT yesterday. This is NOT improvisation. This is war. They prepared this invasion exactly this way - cruelly, cynically. Сonsciously violating the rules of war. Therefore, Kharkiv. Therefore, Chernihiv. Therefore, Sumy. Therefore, Mariupol. And many, many other Ukrainian hero cities have faced pure evil. Atrocity. This was planned. But this will not kill our humanity. Despite everything, we treat war prisoners under the Geneva Convention. Despite everything, our missiles do not hit Russian civilian facilities in response. Or Belarusian. From where rockets fly to our territory every day. Columns of military equipment. Aviation. Against peaceful people. Against peaceful cities. Zhytomyr, Korosten, Ovruch, suburbs of Kyiv, cities in the south... They are preparing to bomb Odesa. Odesa! Russians have always come to Odesa. They have always felt only warmth in Odesa. Only sincerity. And now what? Bombs against Odesa? Artillery against Odesa? Missiles against Odesa? It will be a war crime. It will be a historical crime. Ukrainians! We have been fighting for 11 days. For freedom. For the state. We withstood. We already understand how we will rebuild our country. We are already forming special funds for reconstruction. There are already four of them. Fund for the Restoration of Destroyed Property and Infrastructure. Fund for Economic Recovery and Transformation. Public Debt Service and Repayment Fund. Small and Medium Business Support Fund. And many more programs to support our people. Heroes who fight for our state. And this is just the beginning. And now we still need strength. Wisdom. Will. Victory. Peace! Peace to save Ukraine."

Have not mentioned the obligatory words: \"Forgive me.\" And the obligatory answer: \"God forgives, and I forgive.\" These words seem to have lost their meaning today. At least in part. After everything we went through. We will not forgive the destroyed houses. We will not forgive the missile that our air defense shot down over Okhmatdyt today. And more than five hundred other such missiles that hit our land. All over Ukraine. Hit our people and children. We will not forgive the shooting of unarmed people. Destruction of our infrastructure. We. Will. Not. Forgive. Hundreds and hundreds of victims. Thousands and thousands of sufferings. And God will not forgive. Not today. Not tomorrow. Never. And instead of Forgiveness, there will be a Day of Judgment. I'm sure of it. It seems everything Russian servicemen have already done is still not enough for them. Not enough ruined destinies. Mutilated lives. They want to kill even more. Tomorrow Russia has officially announced the shelling of our territory. Our enterprises. Defense complex. Most were built decades ago. By the Soviet government. Built in cities. And now they are in the middle of an ordinary urban environment. Thousands of people work there. Hundreds of thousands live nearby. This is murder. Deliberate murder. And I have not heard a reaction from any world leader today. From any Western politician. Reaction to this announcement. Think about the sense of impunity of the invaders: they announce their planned atrocities. Why? Because there is no reaction. Because there is silence. Not a word, as if Western leaders have dissolved tonight. For this day. I hope that at least tomorrow you will notice it. React. Say something. We know exactly who prepared this attack. We know exactly how orders will follow the vertical command. We know everything. And we will not forgive anything. The Tribunal is waiting for you. And God's judgment, if you try to hide. The audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal to the West that sanctions against Russia are not enough. Because they didn't understand. Did not feel. They did not see that the world is really determined. Really determined to stop this war. You will not hide from this reality. You will not hide from new murders in Ukraine. There was a lot of talk about humanitarian corridors. There were talks every day about the opportunity for people to leave the cities where Russia came. Russian military. I am grateful to every Ukrainian who stays to defend our cities, even in the encirclement. Our freedom. But I also know that there are people who really need to get out. Who cannot stay. And we heard the promise that there would be humanitarian corridors. But there are no humanitarian corridors. Instead of humanitarian corridors, they can only make bloody ones. A family was killed in Irpen today. A man, a woman and two children. Right on the road. As in the shooting club. When they were just trying to get out of town. To escape. The whole family. How many such families have died in Ukraine! We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war. On our land. We will find every bastard. Which shot at our cities, our people. Which bombed our land. Which launched rockets. Which gave the order and pressed \"start\". There will be no quiet place on this earth for you. Except for the grave. Today I decided to award orders to the heads of regional administrations and mayors who have excelled in the defense of their communities. The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the Third Degree is awarded to: Head of Kharkiv Regional State Administration Oleh Vasyliovych Syniehubov. Head of Mykolaiv Regional State Administration Vitalii Oleksandrovych Kim. Head of Donetsk Regional State Administration Pavlo Oleksandrovych Kyrylenko. Head of Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhiy Volodymyrovych Haidai. Head of Chernihiv Regional State Administration Vyacheslav Anatoliyovych Chaus. Head of Sumy Regional State Administration Dmytro Oleksiyovych Zhyvytskyi. The Order of Courage is awarded to: Mayor of Kharkiv Ihor Oleksandrovych Terekhov. Mayor of Mykolaiv Oleksandr Fedorovych Senkevych. Mayor of Chernihiv Vladyslav Anatoliyovych Atroshenko. Mayor of Sumy Oleksandr Mykolayovych Lysenko. Mayor of Kherson Ihor Viktorovych Kolykhayev. Mayor of Melitopol Ivan Serhiyovych Fedorov. Mayor of Nova Kakhovka Volodymyr Ivanovych Kovalenko. And I decided to award a special title to our heroes, our hero cities. As it has already been once. When we withstood another attack. But a similar attack. Another invasion. But no less brutal invasion. Hero cities will be: Kharkiv. Chernihiv. Mariupol. Kherson. Hostomel. Volnovakha."

  "speech": "We have been defending ourselves against the invasion for 12 days already. We never wanted this war. But it was brought to us. We never dreamed of killing. But we have to knock out the enemy. From our land and from our lives. We have to endure what no other European nation has seen in 80 years. And it is on our land that it is decided whether someone else in Europe will fall victim to the same aggression. I’m telling this to the leaders of the world and I hear that they agree. We decide the future of the continent. WIth our resistance. And our friends - with their help. I spoke again with Polish President Andrzej Duda. They help us. Keep working. I spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson and Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi. With President of France Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister of India Modi. I received very important signals, which, I'm sure, will only strengthen Ukraine. Our theses in conversations with partners are absolutely logical. They are fair. Honest. If the invasion continues and Russia does not abandon its plans against Ukraine, then a new sanctions package is needed. New sanctions, new sanction steps against war and for peace. Boycott of Russian exports. In particular, the refusal of oil and petroleum products from Russia. This can be called an embargo. Or just morality. When you refuse to give money to a terrorist. Boycott of imports to Russia. If they do not want to follow civilized rules, they should not receive goods and services from civilization. Let the war feed them. The international community must act even more decisively. When someone loses their mind, we have to lose fear and forget about commerce. We need to defend ourselves. You have to be moral. Both states and companies. We must fight against the inhuman force that wants to destroy humanity itself. The success of the Ukrainian army. The will of the Ukrainian people.The principled nature of international sanctions. This is the way to peace. At night the invaders fired at Mykolaiv. Right at the residential areas. Using rocket artillery. They fired at Kharkiv, at residential areas of a peaceful city. They fired at other cities of our state. No military sense. Just terror. Residents of Irpen, Bucha, Hostomel and many other towns and villages, which the invader managed to capture, are being held hostage. Temporarily. Until the invaders get punishment. And they will get it. Our Armed Forces know how to do it. The enemy is tired. Demoralized. They came to our land to look for something that has never been here: cowardice, consent to slavery. Any normal person is afraid to look at burned houses. It is obvious. Destroyed panel high-rise buildings. Destroyed ordinary cars. Missiles, air bombs, \"Grads\", mortars. Against people. It feels like it's in another country. But this is in our country. In ours, not somewhere else. In ours. Which has always wanted peace above anything else. How many more deaths and losses are needed to secure the sky over Ukraine? How do civilians in Kharkiv or Mykolaiv differ from Hamburg or Vienna? We are waiting for a decision. Securing the sky. Either with the power you have, or give us fighter jets and air defense systems that will provide us with the strength we need. This is the help that the world should provide not just to Ukraine, but to itself. To prove: humanity will win. As soon as possible. The Government of Ukraine is already working on how to restore our state after the victory. How to give more strength to the country while we are fighting. A special package of assistance to businesses and employees has been created. Sole proprietors of the first and second groups are completely exempt from UST. Enterprises and sole proprietors of the third group are exempt from paying UST for employees who were drafted into the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other defense formations. In particular, the territorial defense. Exemption from land tax and rent for state and communal land in all areas where hostilities are taking place. All this is during martial law and at least a year after its end. The payment of taxes for all enterprises that are unable to pay them is postponed. And this is only the first part of a large aid package. Government support. All leaders of the central government have a clear task: to develop a system of action so that the recovery of Ukraine is rapid and focused only on people. First of all - on people. For us all to return to peace, to normal work. When we return our land, return peace to our land. I am grateful to all business owners and managers who continue to work and fulfill their obligations to their employees. To pay salaries to people - even if the company does not work as before - is to protect Ukraine. The state fulfills all its obligations. Indexed pensions have already been provided to the people. The salary in the budget sphere is paid as it should be. Ukrainians! There are millions of us. And these are millions of ways to fight for our future. For our state. For our freedom. For our national flag. Blue and yellow. Not a tricolor. We defend our flag because it is our worldview. Under the blue and yellow we gained victories at the Olympics. We unfurled this flag both in space and in Antarctica. Under our national flag, our rescuers, firefighters, peacekeepers, medics and everyone else came to the aid of Turkey, Greece, Israel and Georgia, Afghanistan and Montenegro, India, Italy, the Congo and many other countries. What we have never done under this flag is attacking other countries, seizing foreign lands, killing people, peaceful people of other nations. We and terror are different universes. That is why there is no blood on our flag. There are no and will never be black spots on it. There are no and will never be any swastikas on it. The Ukrainian flag is the land. Peaceful, fertile, golden and without tanks. This is the sky. Peaceful, clear, blue and without missiles. So it was. And so it will be. I believe! I know."

  "speech": "Monday. Evening. You know, we used to say: Monday is a hard day. There is a war in the country. So every day is Monday. And now we are used to the fact that every day and every night are like that. Today is the 12th. 12th evening of our struggle. Our defense. We are all on the ground, we are all working. Everyone is where they should be. I am in Kyiv. My team is with me. The territorial defense is on the ground. The servicemen are in positions. Our heroes! Doctors, rescuers, transporters, diplomats, journalists... Everyone. We are all at war. We all contribute to our victory, which will definitely be achieved. By force of arms and our army. By force of words and our diplomacy. By force of spirit, which the first, the second and each of us have. Take a look at our country today. Chaplynka, Melitopol, Tokmak, Novotroitske and Kherson. Starobilsk. Everywhere people defended themselves, although they do not have weapons there. But these are our people, and that's why they have weapons. They have courage. Dignity. And hence the ability to go out and say: I'm here, it's mine, and I won't give it away. My city. My community. My Ukraine. Every Ukrainian man and woman who protested against the invaders yesterday, today and will protest tomorrow are heroes. We shout at the invaders together with you. We stand in the squares and streets with you. We are not afraid with you when the invaders open fire and try to drive everyone away. YOU do not back down. WE do not back down. And the one who repeated: \"We are one people\" - certainly did not expect such a powerful reaction. In the south of our country, such a national movement has unfolded, such a powerful manifestation of Ukrainianness that we have never seen in the streets and squares there. And for Russia it is like a nightmare. They forgot that we are not afraid of paddy wagons and batons. We are not afraid of tanks and machine guns. When the main thing is on our side, truth. As it is now. Mariupol and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy. Odesa and Kyiv. Mykolaiv. Zhytomyr and Korosten. Ovruch. And many other cities. We know that hatred that the enemy brought to our cities with shelling and bombing will not remain there. There will be no trace of it. Hatred is not about us. Therefore, there will be no trace of the enemy. We will rebuild everything. We will make our cities destroyed by the invader better than any city in Russia. Enerhodar. Chornobyl. And other places where barbarians just don't understand WHAT they want to capture. WHAT they want to control. Your work, your hard work on critical objects is a real feat. And we see it. We are sincerely grateful for it. The Ukrainian army holds positions. Well done! It inflicts extremely painful losses on the enemy. Defends. Counterattacks. If necessary - can take revenge. Necessarily. For every evil. For every rocket and bomb. For each destroyed civilian object. Today in Makariv, Kyiv region, they fired at the bread factory. For what? The old bread factory! Think about it - to fire at the bread factory. Who should you be to do that? Or to destroy another church - in the Zhytomyr region. The Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin built in 1862. These are NOT people. There was an agreement on humanitarian corridors. Did it work? Russian tanks worked instead. Russian \"Grads\". Russian mines. They even mined the road, which was agreed to transport food and medicine for people and children in Mariupol. They even destroy buses that have to take people out. But ... At the same time, they are opening a small corridor to the occupied territory. For several dozen people. Not so much to Russia, as to propagandists. Directly to their TV cameras. Like, that's the one who saves. Just cynicism. Just propaganda. Nothing more. No humanitarian sense. The third round of negotiations in Belarus took place today. I would like to say - the third and final. But we are realists. So we will talk. We will insist on negotiations until we find a way to tell our people: this is how we will come to peace. Exactly to peace. We must realize that every day of struggle, every day of resistance creates better conditions for us. Strong position to guarantee our future. In peace. After this war. Apart from the dead people and the destroyed cities, the war leaves destroyed the aspirations that once seemed very important, but now ... You don't even mention them. Almost three years ago, as soon as the election took place, we entered this building, this office, and immediately began planning our move. I dreamed of moving from Bankova. Together with the government and parliament. To unload the center of Kyiv and in general - to move to a modern, transparent office - as befits a progressive democratic European country. Now I will say one thing: I stay here. I stay in Kyiv. On Bankova Street. I’m not hiding. And I'm not afraid of anyone. As much as it takes to win this Patriotic War of ours. Today I signed a decree to present state awards of Ukraine to 96 Ukrainian heroes - our military. Including… The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the second degree is awarded to: Major Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Sak. Commander of the mechanized battalion who entered the battle with the battalion tactical group of the enemy and won thanks to a rational approach to combat and non-standard tactics. Captain Rostyslav Oleksandrovych Sylivakin. Commander of the mechanized battalion, which successfully fought the overwhelming forces of the enemy, liberating Ukrainian towns and villages in the Sumy region. The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the third degree is awarded to: Lieutenant Ihor Serhiyovych Lozovyi. Acting as part of the group, he stopped a column of enemy vehicles numbering about 150 units, which was moving in the direction of the Zhytomyr-Kyiv route. Destroyed. Lieutenant Vitaliy Viktorovych Poturemets. He showed exemplary courage and composure in the battle, destroying a column of enemy equipment near the city of Kyiv. He was wounded. The Order \"For Courage\" of the third degree is awarded to: Master Sergeant, Commander of the Automobile Platoon Valentyn Viktorovych Baryliuk. Thanks to his brave actions and personal determination, the tank unit received fuel in time and left the encirclement, destroying the enemy on the way. All 96 of our heroes are like these five! Our gratitude to all the military. Our gratitude to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Our gratitude is boundless."

  "speech": "Ukrainians! We always celebrate this holiday. The holiday of spring. We congratulate Ukrainian women, our girls, wives, mothers. Always. But not today. Today, I just can't tell you the traditional words. I just can't congratulate you. I can’t. When there are so many deaths. When there is so much grief. When there is so much suffering. When the war continues. A full-scale terrorist war against our people. The people of Ukraine. The invaders bombed Sumy again. With air bombs. Our peaceful city that has never threatened Russia in its history! Good, quiet, soulful Sumshchyna! Which is turned into hell. Mariupol. Peaceful and hard-working city without any internal malice. It was surrounded. Blocked. And is being deliberately exhausted. Deliberately tortured. The invaders deliberately cut off communication. Deliberately block the delivery of food, water supply. Turn off the electricity. In Mariupol, for the first time in dozens of years, perhaps for the first time since the Nazi invasion, a child died of dehydration. Hear me, today, dear partners! A child died of dehydration. In 2022! We have been fighting for the thirteenth day. We destroy the invaders wherever we can. Everywhere. But there is a sky. Hundreds of Russian cruise missiles. Hundreds of fighter jets of the invaders. Hundreds of helicopters. Yes, we destroy them. Russia has not lost as much aircraft in the past 30 years as in these 13 days in Ukraine. But they still have enough machinery to kill. There are still enough missiles for terror. They still have enough 500 kg bombs to drop them on us, ordinary people. On Chernihiv and Kyiv. Odesa and Kharkiv. Poltava and Zhytomyr. Dozens and dozens of Ukrainian cities. On millions of peaceful Ukrainian people. It has been 13 days of promises. 13 days when we are told that there will soon be help in the sky. There will be planes. They will be handed over to us... The blame for every death of every person in Ukraine from air strikes and in blocked cities, of course, lies with the Russian state, the Russian military, those who give and those who carry out criminal orders, who violate all the rules of warfare, who deliberately exterminate the Ukrainian people. The fault lies with the invaders. But the responsibility for this lies also with those who have not been able to make an obviously necessary decision somewhere in the West, somewhere in the offices for 13 days. Those who have not yet secured the Ukrainian sky from Russian murderers. Those who did not save our cities from air strikes. From these bombs, missiles. Although they can. Those who do not help in lifting the blockade. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people in the cities are on the verge of life and death. Literally. Not as it sounds in the comments of politicians about providing Ukraine with vital combat aircraft. Vital missile defense. Vitally important! We have heard many assurances and seen many agreements. In particular, on the creation of humanitarian corridors. To save our citizens in Mariupol. But they didn't work. All of them didn’t work. Yet. And I have no more time to wait. We do not have. Mariupol doesn’t have time to wait. It is the invaders who want our people to die. Not us. We sent columns with humanitarian aid to Mariupol. Everything necessary is there! We sent vehicles to rescue people. Drivers understand everything. They are heroes. Brave people! They understand that Russian troops can simply destroy these vehicles on the road. Just as they did, killing people who were just trying to get to a safe territory from the war zone. But if you fire at these vehicles, these people, you should know that it will be before the eyes of the whole world. Everyone will be witnesses. And everyone will testify. When everyone, I repeat this, everyone who gives and fulfills inhuman orders will be severely judged and convicted. We have seen the concrete consent of the Russian side to organize an evacuation corridor from the city of Sumy. And not just for our people. For hundreds of foreigners. Citizens of India, China. These are students who studied in Sumy. You know, I was told that the Red Cross, the International Red Cross, forbids us to use the emblem on vehicles carrying out humanitarian missions. The Red Cross prohibits it as if it is their property. And this is indicative. This says a lot about the fact that some people, very influential, have decided to give up Ukrainians. But we will not allow it. And I will not allow it. Our friends. They are next to us. I will appeal directly to the nations of the world if the leaders of the world do not make every effort to stop this war, this genocide. Of course, we continue to talk to our partners, to the leaders, parliamentarians of all countries who know how to help Ukraine. We have a very busy negotiation period. I spoke with Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda. The people of Lithuania always stand by Ukrainians in this struggle. We feel this help and appreciate it. I spoke with President of the European Council, our friend Charles Michel. I also spoke with Prime Minister of India, Mr. Modi. But there are things that are not decided in negotiations, that depend not directly on us, but on humanity, which must win in the leading capitals, must overcome fear, must overcome any benefits. And then we will see that the Ukrainian sky is safe and the Ukrainian cities are unblocked. We can do this together as people of the world. And if the world stands aloof, it will lose itself. Forever. Because there are unconditional values. The same for everyone. First of all, this is life. The right to life for everyone. This is exactly what we are fighting for in Ukraine. Very fiercely, together with our military. This is exactly what these weak invaders want to deprive us of. This is exactly what the whole world must protect. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Mr. Speaker! Mr. Prime Minister! Members of the government, parliament, lords. Ladies and gentlemen! I’m addressing all the people of the United Kingdom. All the people of Great Britain. Great people. With a great history. I’m addressing you as a citizen, as President of a great country as well. With a great dream. And a great struggle. I want to tell you about our 13 days. 13 days of fierce war, which we did not start and did not want. But we are waging it. Because we do not want to lose what we have, what is ours - Ukraine. Just as you did not want to lose your island when the Nazis were preparing to start the battle for your great power, the battle for Britain. 13 days of our defense. On the first day at 4 am, cruise missiles were fired at us. So that everyone woke up - we, the children, all of us, living people, all of Ukraine. And we haven't slept since. We all took up arms becoming a large army. The next day we fought off attacks in the air, on land and at sea. And our heroic border guards on Zmiinyi Island in the Black Sea told everyone about the end of the war. Namely: where the enemy will go in the end. When a Russian ship demanded that our guys lay down their weapons, they answered him... As firmly as one cannot say in the parliament. And we felt the power. Great power of our people who will persecute the invader to the end. On the third day, Russian troops openly fired at people and apartment buildings without hiding. Used artillery, air bombs. And it finally showed us, showed the world who is who. Who are great people and who are just savages. On the fourth day, when we have already begun to take dozens of prisoners, we have not lost our dignity. We didn’t abuse them. We treat them like people. Because we remained human on the fourth day of this shameful war. On the fifth day, the terror against us has already become outright. Against cities, against small towns. Ruined districts. Bombs, bombs, bombs, again bombs on houses, on schools, on hospitals. This is genocide. Which did not break us. It mobilized each and every one of us. And it gave us a sense of great truth. On the sixth day, Russian missiles hit Babyn Yar. This is the place where the Nazis executed 100,000 people during World War II. 80 years later, Russia killed them for a second time. On the seventh day, we realized they were destroying even the churches. Using bombs! Rockets again. They do not know the holy and great as we know. On the eighth day, the world saw Russian tanks firing at a nuclear power plant. The largest in Europe. And the world began to understand that this is terror against all. This is a great terror. On the ninth day, we listened to a meeting of NATO countries. Without the desired result for us. Without courage. That's how we felt - I don't want to offend anyone - we felt that alliances don't work. They can't even close the sky. That is why security guarantees in Europe must be built from scratch. On the tenth day, unarmed Ukrainians protested everywhere in the occupied cities. Stopping armored vehicles with bare hands. We have become unbreakable. On the eleventh day, when residential areas were already bombed, when everything was destroyed by explosions, when children were evacuated from a damaged children's oncology hospital... We realized: Ukrainians became heroes. Hundreds of thousands of people. Entire cities. Children, adults - all. On the twelfth day, when the losses of the Russian army have already exceeded 10,000 killed, the general also appeared in this number. And this gave us confidence: for all crimes, for all shameful orders there will still be responsibility before the International Court or Ukrainian weapons. On the thirteenth day, a child died in Russian-occupied Mariupol. Died of dehydration. They do not allow food or water to people. They just blocked it - and people are in the basements. I think everyone hears: people don't have water there! In 13 days of the Russian invasion, 50 children were killed. 50 great martyrs. This is dreadful! This is emptiness. Instead of 50 universes that could live, they took them away. They just took them away. Great Britain! Ukraine did not strive for that. It did not seek greatness. But it became great during these days of this war. Ukraine that saves people despite the terror of the invaders. Defends freedom despite the blows of one of the world's largest armies. Defends despite the open sky. Still open to Russian missiles, aircraft, helicopters. \"To be or not to be?\" - You know this Shakespearean question well. 13 days ago, this question could still be raised about Ukraine. But not now. Obviously, to be. Obviously, to be free. And if not here, where should I remind you of the words that Great Britain has already heard. And which are relevant again. We shall not give up and shall not lose! We shall go the whole way. We shall fight in the seas, we shall fight in the air, we shall defend our land, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight in the woods, in the fields, on the beaches, in the cities and villages, in the streets, we shall fight in the hills ... And I want to add: we shall fight on the spoil tips, on the banks of the Kalmius and the Dnieper! And we shall not surrender! Of course, with your help, with the help of the civilization of great countries. With your support, for which we are grateful and on which we rely. And I am especially grateful to you, Boris, my friend! Increase sanctions against the terrorist state. Recognize it as a terrorist state finally. Find a way to make our Ukrainian sky safe. Do what you can. Do what you have to. Do what the greatness of your state and your people obliges to. Glory to the great Ukraine! Glory to Great Britain."

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today we have important news. The United States has taken a step that will significantly weaken the invaders. It will make them pay for aggression and be responsible for the evil they have done. For all the evil. America bans imports of oil from Russia, petroleum products, gas, coal. Prohibits US citizens from any investment in Russia's fuel and energy sector. I am grateful personally to President of the United States Biden for this decision. For this leadership. For this most powerful signal to the whole world. It is very simple: every penny paid to Russia turns into bullets and projectiles that fly to other sovereign states. Either Russia will respect international law and will not wage wars, or it will not have the money to start wars. Another gas station will be found. But it's not just about the money. A ban on oil imports to the United States will weaken the terrorist state economically, politically and ideologically. Because it is about freedom, about the future. About where the world will go. The United Kingdom is also banning the import of oil and petroleum products from Russia. I am grateful to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the principled position you expect from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in difficult times. Speaking today in the British Parliament, I mentioned other difficult times. Other, yet similar. 1940, when tyranny threatened what it considered a small island. And it was sure that the island would not withstand brutal blows, bombings and a blockade. And it turned out that the island could do more than that tyranny. Because it had wisdom. And endurance. And friends. And strength. And it believed in the future, the future of its own and the future of freedom in Europe. As we believe. As we fight. And as we will win. Look: the world does not believe in the future of Russia, does not talk about it. Not a word, not a prospect. They understand everything. They talk about us. They help us. They are preparing to support our reconstruction. After the war. Because everyone saw that for the people who defend themselves so heroically, this \"after the war\" will surely come. There will be a new Marshall Plan for Ukraine. The West will form this support package. The British Prime Minister said this today. A man of his word, a sincere friend of Ukraine. We are already expecting tough decisions from the European Union. Sanctions. Against Russia. For this war. For this aggression, which its authors will regret. They will. For sure. That is why it is so important that the Russian leadership realizes that the world will follow the example of the United States, Great Britain, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Japan and other free countries. So, the world cannot be fooled. Sanctions cannot be avoided. I am grateful to those Russians who support us, take to the streets and fight. They are fighting daily for us and for themselves. Because they are fighting for peace. The war must end. We need to sit down at the negotiating table - honest, substantive, in the interests of the people, not obsolete murderous ambitions. I spoke today with Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands. We have a new page in relations with the Netherlands. Thank you for your support. With Prime Minister of Israel Bennett. With Prime Minister of Luxembourg Bettel and President of France Macron. We have support. We have an understanding. You may have seen in the news today the story that the United Nations allegedly does not consider the Russian invasion a war. I know this outraged many, and not only in Ukraine. I am grateful to our team. We made everything clear and quickly received assurances: there will be no lies in the UN structures. There will be no playing along with the aggressor. The word \"war\" will be heard on this site. Because that is the truth. We will not allow anyone in the world to ignore the suffering and murder of our people, our children. Today, when I spoke to the British Parliament, the scariest number was 50. 50 Ukrainian children killed in 13 days of war. And in an hour it was 52. 52 children. I will never forgive that. And I know that you will never forgive the invaders. Like Kharkiv, Mariupol and all other cities. In the evening, they fired a missile at Korbutivka in the Zhytomyr region. Destroyed the dormitory. How could an ordinary dormitory threaten Russia? What geopolitical interests of the nuclear state were threatened by it? Eternal memory to all the people who were killed by these savages. Today we managed to organize a humanitarian corridor from the city of Sumy to Poltava. Hundreds of people were saved. The humanitarian cargo was delivered. But that's only one percent of what needs to be done, of what people, blocked Ukrainians expect. We are ready. Our cargo is ready. Our transport is ready. But ... savages - they are not ready. They fire at evacuation routes. They block the delivery of essential products and medicines to people. What do they want? They want Ukrainians to take it from the hands of the invaders. This is torture. Deliberate. Systematic. Organized by their state. Foreign to us. And ruthless for everyone, even for its citizens. Oleshky in the Kherson region. Berdyansk and Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia region. All the cities where Ukrainians are resisting, where they are protesting against the invaders... Know: we stand with you. We are grateful. The cargo will still go. No matter how many bullets stop them. Humanitarian corridors will still work. And only time separates you from freedom. Short time. Believe it. I believe. And I really want that. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Brave Ukrainians of the unconquered country! It is already the 14th day of our defense. The 14th day of our unity. Truly all-Ukrainian. The scale of the threat to the state is maximum. The invasion contingent has already brought into our territory almost everyone who was gathered to invade Ukraine. But the scale of our answer is maximum as well. And these are two different words \"maximum\".  They have only equipment. At the maximum. We have our people in addition to the equipment. Up to the mark. They only have orders. To attack, to kill, to abuse. And we have a real desire of millions of Ukrainians to win. Defend ourselves. Clear our state... And on the renewed land There will be no enemy, adversary, And there will be a son, and there will be a mother, And there will be people on the land. Today is Taras Shevchenko's birthday. This is our old dream. It is his dream to clean the land. And it is alive! And quite real. Ukrainians! Everything is in our hands! We withstood and inspired the whole world with our determination. There is no such place on earth where they are not aware of the heroism with which the Ukrainian people defend our beautiful land. Even where we are not supported, they know well what we have achieved. And they feel what else we will achieve if we save the country. If we maintain unity. National force. If we continue to respond wisely and boldly to the activity of the enemy who can destroy the walls of our homes, our schools, our churches, who can destroy Ukrainian enterprises, but will never reach our soul, our heart, our ability to live freely and fight boldly. Our military and territorial defense units managed to replenish the arsenal of our equipment due to the many trophies they took on the battlefield. Enemy tanks, armored vehicles, ammunition will now work for our defense. For our lives. For our country. What could be more humiliating for the invaders? We will beat the enemy with his own weapons. In addition to ours, which the Russian troops have already felt well, so that more and more enemy soldiers and commanders are asking themselves a simple question: why were they sent to this foreign land, to this war? And we have no answer. Except for one word - death. Russian soldiers! You still have a chance to survive. Almost two weeks of our resistance have shown you that we will not give up. Because this is our home. These are our families and children. We will fight until we regain our land and take revenge for all our killed people. For the killed children. You can still be saved if you just leave. Do not believe your commanders when they tell you that you still have a chance in Ukraine. Nothing is waiting for you here. Except for captivity, except for death. You take our lives and give yours. And we know - we have communications interception - that your commanders already understand everything. This war must be ended. We must return to peace. Leave our home, go back to yours. 14 days of a full-scale brutal war. Terror against our people. Destruction of cities, blockade of entire districts, constant bombing... 14 days of absence of a vital decision. Not our decision! We would make that decision in hours if we had to help our friends. From the first day of the Russian invasion, Ukraine has been repeating to its partners that if you do not close the sky, you will also be responsible for this catastrophe, a large-scale humanitarian catastrophe. Russia uses missiles, aircraft, helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. This is the world's humanitarian duty to respond. But... There is no decision. We are grateful to Poland for the alternative - for its readiness to provide Ukraine with combat aircraft. The problem is in logistics. In fact, it is a technical issue. It must be solved! Immediately. There is an official decision of Poland to transfer the planes to the relevant base - the American base. We also have confirmation - we have all heard - that the agreement between the American party and Poland has been reached. But at the same time we hear that Poland's proposal is allegedly unfounded. And that's what they say in Washington. We also read this. So when will the decision be made? Listen: we have a war! We do not have time for all these signals. This is not ping pong! This is about human lives! We ask once again: solve it faster. Do not shift the responsibility, send us planes. Yesterday we finally managed to organize a humanitarian corridor. From the city of Sumy to Poltava. 1,600 students and 3,500 residents were rescued. Evacuation of people from cities and towns of the Kyiv region continues. More than 18,000 people have already been rescued from Dymer, Vorzel and Irpin. Today we will do everything to continue the functioning of humanitarian corridors. Sumy - Poltava. Izyum - Lozova. Enerhodar - Zaporizhzhia. Mariupol - Zaporizhzhia. Vorzel, Bucha, Borodyanka, Hostomel to Kyiv. Our government officials are working on this, our servicemen have created all the conditions. If there is at least one shot, full responsibility lies with the invaders. And you have already seen the world’s response. Powerful. Sanction packages. In the morning I spoke with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. We have full understanding. Full support. Our delegation returned from Belarus last night, from negotiations. I will listen to their report. We will prepare for the next rounds of talks. For the sake of Ukraine. For peace. And finally. Concerning our unity. This is our strength. This is what is needed at this time. We are receiving a lot of signals that someone in Ukraine has decided that he or she may not fight anymore together with everyone. And tries somehow separately, for something personal, for some personal benefit... We are receiving various signals that some politicians are looking for threads to Russia again. And some others are again working for a split, contrary to unity. I want to say one thing and only once: I see what you are doing. If I hear another signal, the answer will be quick. As befits wartime. Thank God, our people have already sorted everything and everyone out. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Europeans! Ukrainians! Mariupol residents! Today is the day that defines everything. Defines who is on whose side. Russian bombs fell on a hospital and maternity hospital in Mariupol. Children's hospital. Maternity hospital that is functioning! Buildings are destroyed. As of now, there are 17 wounded. Disassembly of the debris is still ongoing. People began to hide from the air threat in time. From 500 kg aviation bombs dropped by the invaders on Ukrainian cities. Many times already. Children's hospital. Maternity hospital. What did they threaten the Russian Federation with? What kind of country is this - the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals and maternity hospitals and destroys them? Were there little Banderivtsi? Or were pregnant women going to fire at Rostov? Did someone in the maternity hospital abuse Russian-speakers? What was that? Was it the denazification of the hospital? It is beyond atrocities already. Everything that the invaders are doing to Mariupol is beyond atrocities already. Europeans! Ukrainians! Mariupol residents! Today, we must be united in condemning this war crime of Russia, which reflects all the evil that the invaders brought to our land. All destroyed cities. What they did to Volnovakha, Kharkiv, Izyum, Okhtyrka, Chernihiv, Borodyanka, Hostomel, Zhytomyr and dozens of other Ukrainian cities, which never posed any threat to the Russian Federation. Destroyed hospitals. Destroyed schools, churches, houses. And all the people killed. All the children killed. The air bomb on the maternity hospital is the final proof. Proof that the genocide of Ukrainians is taking place. Europeans! You won’t be able to say that you didn't see what happened to Ukrainians, what happened to Mariupol residents. You saw. You know. Therefore, you must increase sanctions against Russia so that it no longer has any opportunity to continue this genocide. You must put pressure on Russia to force it to sit down at the negotiating table and end this brutal war. Moscow knows very well that Mariupol is also the Donetsk region. We have heard so much from Russia about the inhabitants of the Donetsk region. So many accusations, so many demands... And now we see how Russia actually treats the residents of the Donetsk region. Treats ordinary people who live in the houses of Mariupol, work at the enterprises of the city of Mariupol, are treated in hospitals of Mariupol and give birth to children, imagine, people like you give birth to children in the maternity hospitals of Mariupol. We have not done and never would have done anything similar to this war crime to any of the cities of the Donetsk, Luhansk or any other region. To any of the cities on earth. Because we are people. And you? I spoke today with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. We also worked and spoke with Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. Thank you for your support, Boris. The partners are fully informed about what is happening in our Mariupol. And about the situation in all other regions of Ukraine, where hostilities continue. We are working to make Russia feel the consequences of its actions. We are doing everything to finally secure our sky. I am grateful to the vast majority of Ukrainians who support this position. Those who collect signatures, who convince their acquaintances in the West, write on social networks, organize rallies. Together we must return courage to some Western leaders. So that they finally do what they had to do on the first day of the invasion. Either close the Ukrainian sky from Russian missiles and bombs, or give us fighter jets so that we can do everything ourselves. A pause without a decision has become simply deadly. Today we managed to organize the work of three humanitarian corridors. From the city of Sumy, from the cities and towns of the Kyiv region and from Enerhodar. In total, about 35,000 people were rescued. We will continue tomorrow. We are preparing six corridors. We pray that people will be taken out of Mariupol, Izyum, Volnovakha, etc. Taken to safe cities of our free Ukraine. And I am sure that every Ukrainian whose help these people need will do everything possible to make them feel our care. Until they can return home. And finally. Every year on March 9, the winners of the Shevchenko Prize are announced. Our national award for the most significant contribution to the preservation and development of the Ukrainian spirit, our national culture. I believe that our traditions must be observed during martial law and the fierce battles for our freedom. We must not betray them so that we preserve all ours, Ukrainian, completely while we are heading to victory. While we are heading to peace. The decree was signed. Now I look forward to meeting the winners. But after the victory. After the victory of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Information about the victims of yesterday's bombing of the maternity hospital and the children's hospital in Mariupol appeared last night. We lost three people, including a child, a girl. The number of wounded is 17. These are children, women, medical workers. You know, this topic was mentioned on Russian television. It was on their talk show. But not a word of truth was said. The Russians were lied to that there had been no patients in the hospital and no women or children in the maternity hospital. The Russians were lied to that \"nationalists\" had allegedly taken up positions there. They lie confidently, as always. War crimes are impossible without the propagandists who cover them up. I want to tell them one thing: you will bear responsibility just as all those who give orders to bomb civilians. We will find all the property of the propagandists and their associates. We will do our best to confiscate it wherever it is. You love a rich life. Love prosperous countries. You will not have this anymore. And this is just the beginning. You will definitely be prosecuted for complicity in war crimes. And then, it will definitely happen, you will be hated by Russian citizens. Everyone whom you have been deceiving constantly, daily, for many years in a row. When they feel the consequences of your lies in their wallets, in their shrinking possibilities. In the stolen future of Russian children. War is never isolated. It always beats both the victim and the aggressor. The aggressor just realizes it later. But it always realizes and always suffers. Today, we are once again providing humanitarian corridors for our cities. The buses have already departed, the trucks are already on their way - with food, water, medicine. Mariupol, Volnovakha, Izyum, Sumy and the region. Cities and towns of the Kyiv region - Bucha, Borodyanka, Irpin, Hostomel... My heart is broken by what the invaders did to our cities, to our state! And by what they want to do to our people who need urgent help. Russian troops have already created a humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine. But for them it is part of the plan. They want to humiliate our people. Make them take bread and water from the hands of the invaders standing on their knees. So that Ukrainians can save their lives just by going to the occupied territories or to Russia. That's why they are blocking Mariupol, that's why they are blocking Volnovakha, blocking other cities. The invaders specially organize this torture to give their propaganda channels new material. Just for that. Monsters. Despite everything, updated information was received every hour yesterday about people whom we managed to evacuate to the free territory of Ukraine. In total, more than 60,000 of our citizens were rescued yesterday plus those who did not have time until night and continued the evacuation in the morning. I spoke today, in particular about that, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. About the torture of our cities, our people. I spoke with French President Macron. I felt in a conversation with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson that our anti-war coalition will soon become much stronger. Consequently, the pressure on Russia for peace will also be much stronger. For us, specifics in relations with world leaders, with European leaders are very important. We are really fighting for our independence! For freedom, for equality for all on the continent! That is why we want to see from partners the decisions based on reality, not on declarations or abstract considerations. These days, the EU leaders will convene to discuss Russia's war against Ukraine. To discuss our application for EU membership. We are waiting for a concrete signal. We look forward to strong support. Because it will be fair, real, human, European. We know exactly the position of every leader. We know exactly who stands with us and who thinks that the European Union is just accounting, profits, expenses and nothing more. We will work, we will persuade. Life will convince them. Ukrainians! Our defenders! We all have been defending our state for the 15th day. We endured. The Ukrainian army is repelling attacks in key directions. Thanks to our military, National Guards, border guards, police, territorial defense and everyone who joined the defense of the state, we have not become slaves, and will never become! Because this is our spirit, this is our destiny. Pride for our Armed Forces of Ukraine is boundless! After the war, after our victory, we will rebuild everything that was destroyed. Very quickly and with a very high quality. A special state program for reconstruction will be created for each affected city. I have already instructed the government to start the elaboration. Chernihiv and Sumy, Okhtyrka and Zhytomyr, Izyum, Mariupol and all our beautiful cities to which evil has come will not see a single trace of the Russian invasion. The best architects, the best companies, the best projects. For every city! I want to say this on the example of Kharkiv. Our Kharkiv, which is now experiencing the worst suffering since World War II. Saltivka, Oleksiivka... Perhaps most Ukrainians know nothing about these names. But the people of Kharkiv will hear. Freedom Square will be such that everyone, all of us, all Europeans will be there! Poltava Way, Belgorod Highway, Myronosytska Street, Regional Children's Hospital, Kharkiv Oncology Center, Karazin University, Labor Palace, Korolenko Library. We will rebuild everything! I promise you personally. Kharkiv residents will see that Ukraine stands with them. And it really does. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! One of the main tasks for us today was the organization of humanitarian corridors. Sumy, Trostyanets, Krasnopillya, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel, Izyum. Almost 40,000 people have already been evacuated this day. They were given safety at last. In Poltava, Kyiv, Cherkasy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Lviv. Humanitarian cargoes were also delivered. Hundreds of tons of food, medicine. We are doing everything to save our people in the cities that the enemy just wants to destroy. Taking into account the work of humanitarian corridors in the previous two days, we have already evacuated about one hundred thousand people. But… Mariupol and Volnovakha remain completely blocked. Although we did everything necessary to make the humanitarian corridor work, Russian troops did not cease fire. Despite this, I decided to send a convoy of trucks to Mariupol anyway. With food, water, medicine. I am grateful to the drivers - brave people who were ready to fulfill this mission. An extremely important mission. But the invaders started a tank attack exactly in the area where this corridor was supposed to be. Corridor of life. For the people of Mariupol. They did it consciously. They knew what they were disrupting. They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to torture it, to carry out constant bombardment. Today they destroyed the building of the main department of the State Emergency Service in the Donetsk region. Right next to this building was the place where Mariupol residents were to gather for evacuation. This is outright terror. Blatant terror. From experienced terrorists. The world needs to know that. It has to admit it. We are all dealing with a terrorist state. But no matter what, we will try! Constantly! We will continue to try to bring to Mariupol the aid that people so desperately need. Ukrainians need. The invaders are doing everything to deceive our people in the besieged cities. They block communication. Prevent the provision of Information. The state is doing everything to help our city. Everything to tell the people of Mariupol: we are fighting. And we will not give up this fight. Therefore, if you have the opportunity to talk to the people of Mariupol, to write to the people of Mariupol, spread the truth. Remind them that Ukraine is with them wholeheartedly and is doing everything to stop the torture of the city. Russian propagandists have substantially intensified their activity today. And they tried very hard. Probably in order to cover up the crimes of their army in Ukraine. Crimes against Mariupol. Against Donbas. Against Kharkiv. Against dozens of other cities. Cover them up with new accusations. New-old fakes. They accuse us... Again us! That we are allegedly developing biological weapons. Allegedly, we are preparing a chemical attack. This makes me really worried, because we’ve been repeatedly convinced: if you want to know Russia's plans, look at what Russia accuses others of. Look, spreading such accusations in the Russian media shows that it is THEY who are capable of this. The Russian military, the Russian special services. It shows that they want it. They have already done such things in other countries. Similar! They themselves announced, they themselves organized, they themselves complained. And they will do so again. Again and again. If they are not stopped. They tore apart Moldova with Transnistria. They tore apart Georgia with Abkhazia. They tore apart Ukraine with Donbas and Crimea. But they blame us! Those who have become victims. Those who are forced to defend themselves. Fight for the right to live. They themselves come to us in tanks and with missiles. They take something that doesn’t belong to them. Capture. They are even ashamed to show their officers! They hide their generals. They conceal from their own people that they are sending conscripts to this war only to make the invasion forces larger. But we are to blame! We are accused of attacks on allegedly peaceful Russia. And now what? What are these allegations of preparing chemical attacks? Have you decided to carry out \"de-chemicalization\" of Ukraine? Using ammonia? Using phosphorus? What else have you prepared for us? Where will you strike with chemical weapons? At the maternity hospital in Mariupol? At the church in Kharkiv? At the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital? Or at laboratories, most of which have remained since Soviet times and are engaged in ordinary science. Ordinary! NOT military technology. We are adequate people. I am the President of an adequate country, an adequate nation. And the father of two children. And no chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction were developed on my land. The whole world knows that. You know that. And if You do something like that against US, you will get the most severe sanctions response. Ukrainians! Our defenders! I have signed several important decrees. About awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to thirteen of our defenders: Lieutenant Colonel Litun Andriy Mykolayovych. Posthumously. He died covering our troops and heroically restraining the enemy's offensive. Captain Korpan Oleksandr Bohdanovych. Posthumously. He saved our soldiers and civilian houses when he took the falling aircraft away from them. Junior Lieutenant Blokha Yuriy Ihorovych. Posthumously. In the battles in the Mykolaiv region he heroically protected brothers-in-arms, saving their lives. Senior Sergeant Ivashko Andriy Oleksandrovych. Posthumously. During the rocket fire, he personally provided information about the enemy's actions at the cost of his own life. Junior Sergeant Volkov Yevhen Volodymyrovych. Posthumously. For courage and heroism during the evacuation of the wounded in the Donetsk region, for saving our military. Major General Nikoliuk Viktor Dmytrovych. He skillfully led the defense in the north-eastern direction and managed to prevent the capture of Chernihiv. Colonel Khoda Leonid Oleksiyovych. During the war, under his command, more than 50 enemy vehicles were destroyed. Lieutenant Colonel Ponomarenko Vyacheslav Anatoliyovych. Thanks to his actions, a significant number of enemy’s equipment and soldiers in the city of Hostomel were destroyed. Lieutenant Colonel Yakovenko Oleksandr Oleksiyovych. He withdrew his units from the enemy artillery fire, thanks to which he saved personnel and continued to successfully defend the Donetsk region. Major Bova Yevhen Petrovych. For the heroic defense of Mariupol and holding positions under constant enemy attacks. Captain Boyechko Vasyl Vasyliovych. For the extremely successful destruction of enemy equipment and manpower. Sergeant Moroz Oleh Romanovych. Thanks to his heroic deeds, the enemy's offensive in the Luhansk region was stopped. Sailor Samofalov Valeriy Mykhailovych. In one battle, for the first time in the history of this war, he shot down three enemy helicopters. I also signed a decree awarding orders for personal courage to 39 national guardsmen, 31 policemen (9 posthumously), 14 border guards (4 posthumously) and 23 employees of the State Emergency Service. Today the rank of Brigadier General is awarded to: Nechayev Oleh Oleksandrovych. For the successful defense of the Kyiv region. Lishchynsky Vladyslav Vatslavovych. For extremely successful actions against the enemy in the Kherson region. Hutsol Volodymyr Volodymyrych. For the successful destruction of enemy airborne troops in Vasylkiv. Demyanchyk Hryhoriy Petrovych. For the successful organization of personnel training for our military units. And finally. Discussions on Ukraine's future in the EU continue today and tomorrow in Europe. I believe that our people, our state, our army did everything for us to be welcome there. As equals. For us to be invited there. This is the final exam for Europe. Among the leaders of the states there are those who support us. And there are also those who support only themselves. But we see how the nations of all European countries treat us. And this is the main thing. Because I know for sure - if people decided on our membership in the EU, they would definitely choose the people of Ukraine. Today, when I see the support of the people of each country in the squares of European capitals, I know that the Ukrainian people are already in the European Union. And politicians... I'm sure they will adjust to that. Preferably faster. Glory to the nations of Europe! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to our military! Thank you!"

  "speech": "Free people of a free country! We have been fighting for our freedom for the 16th day already. This is four times longer than the enemy planned for his invasion. Four times longer! Against the army, which was considered one of the strongest in the world. Which hoped that the Ukrainians would surrender. Hoped that someone would meet Russian flags on Ukrainian streets, on our streets with flowers. But Ukrainians are proud people who always defend their land and will not give the invader a single piece of land. Not a percent of their freedom. 16 days. I know that many people have started to feel tired. I understand. Impatience. I understand. Emotions play a bad game with people. This is life. When we mobilize, when we see our victories and the loss of the enemy on the battlefield, we expect the struggle to end sooner. We expect the invaders to fall faster. But... This is life, this is war. This is a struggle. Time is still needed. Patience is still needed. Our wisdom, energy. The ability to do our job to the maximum so that we can win together. It is impossible to say how many more days we must liberate our Ukrainian land. But it is possible to say - we will do it! Because we strived for that. Because we have already reached a strategic turning point. We are already moving towards our goal, towards our victory. This is a patriotic war. War with a very stubborn enemy who does not pay attention to the thousands of his killed people, killed soldiers. Who is now gathering reservists and conscripts all over Russia to throw them into the hell of this war. Who came up with the idea of throwing mercenaries against our people. Thugs from Syria. From the country that was destroyed in the same way as the invaders are destroying us now - our Mariupol, our Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Chernihiv, Volnovakha, Izyum, etc. This is how Russian troops treat Ukrainians. This is how they treat Donbas, Russian-speaking people, as they said. How they shouted to everyone about \"protection\", which they talked about so much in Moscow. Rockets, air bombs, artillery. And now Syrian mercenaries who do not distinguish at all who speaks what language here, what church people go to, what party people supported. Mercenaries who simply go to kill in a foreign land - in every sense of the word. Over the past night and morning, the invaders carried out, as they say, \"demilitarization\" of the water supply system in Chernihiv. The city was left without water. We are doing everything to restore the water supply. Due to constant shelling in parts of the Sumy, Kyiv, Donetsk regions there is no electricity, yes, there are problems with heating, no gas, water. This is a humanitarian catastrophe. Humanitarian catastrophe - two words that have become fully synonymous with the other two words - the Russian Federation. At night, the invaders bombed a shoe factory, an apartment building and a kindergarten in Dnipro. For what? How did they threaten the Russian state? They destroyed residential houses in the villages of the Sumy region. They continued torturing Mariupol residents, Kharkiv residents. They fired rockets at Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk... If this continues, sanctions against Russia are not enough. And I expect, we are already working on this, new sanctions from our partners today. Russia must pay for this terrible war. Pay daily! A very important meeting of the leaders of the European Union took place yesterday. Long, substantive. We know what was said at this meeting. What all leaders said. Who specifically spoke. Who supported. Who remained silent. And who tried to make the wording insufficient - for Ukraine, Europe and our common freedom. How do we evaluate the decision made? It's very simple: it must be stronger. This is not what we expect. It is necessary that the decisions of politicians coincide with the mood of their nations, European nations. We are aware of this mood. And they are aware of this mood. Every politician is well aware! The numbers are different in different countries, but there are polls and support is huge. At least 60 percent stand in favor. And this is the vast majority which stands for Ukraine to be part of Europe! Europeans are clearly talking about this. And I'm sure they will clearly tell their politicians about this. If they haven't figured it out yet. The decision of yesterday's meeting of EU leaders now reaches the level of the European Commission. For implementation. For specific procedures. The European Union must do more. It must do more for us, for Ukraine. And for itself. We are waiting for that. All European nations are waiting. Our government officials have organized 12 humanitarian corridors today. Cargo with food, water, medicine is already on the way. Izyum, Enerhodar, Volnovakha, Polohy, Bucha, Hostomel, Borodyanka, Andriivka, Mykulychi, Makariv, Kozarovychi, of course, Mariupol. The Ukrainian servicemen have ensured \"silence\" for the humanitarian corridors to work. If the invaders shoot and disrupt the rescue of people again, they will eventually receive such a response from the world that they themselves will need humanitarian corridors. Our government officials, despite difficulties, are doing everything to ensure that there is fuel, products, medicines and all goods people need throughout the country. Gasoline, diesel - everything is imported. This morning I was asked a question at a daily conference call. Logical question. Given the spring. What about sowing? How to start it, especially in those areas that are temporarily occupied? My answer is very simple: all over our land, no matter what, we have to organize a full-fledged sowing campaign this spring. Of course, as much as possible. It all depends on the people and the situation. Because it's about life. Life is more important. It’s about our life. About our dreams. About our future. And therefore, about our victory. I repeat again and again: when we defend freedom, everyone must be like a full-fledged army. Do everything we can in our place to get the result we all deserve. That's fair. To win. Necessarily. Be sure to hold on. Be sure to fight. Be sure to give your all strength. It will not be easy with such a neighbor. But with us, it will not be easy, too. As it already turned out. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President, my friend Andrzej! Dear Mrs. Marshal of the Sejm! Dear Mr. Marshal of the Senate! Ladies and gentlemen deputies and senators! Dear Sirs! Polish brothers and sisters! When I became President in 2019, it felt like we had a long way to go with Poland. Because our relationship was pretty cold, our attitude towards each other wasn’t too warm. This was the situation. But I wanted to go this way fast. The path to warmth. Because we are such nations. I knew that we were akin by nature - Ukrainians, Poles. I remember my first meetings with Andrzej Duda. From meeting to meeting everything changed. The coolness disappeared. We understood each other. As a Ukrainian and a Pole. As Europeans. As friends. As parents who love their families and realize that our children must live in a world of equal good values. Our shared values. They must live in a world where nations are independent, where freedom reigns, where the family matters, and where no one ever has the right to war, to invasion. It is believed that the number seven brings happiness. That is how many neighbors God has given to Ukraine. Does it bring us happiness? The whole world knows the answer today. And 78 Ukrainian children who died from rockets and shelling of the Russian Federation know it better than others. A neighbor who brought trouble and war to our land. A neighbor who obviously acts without God. When there is someone who beats like a savage, it is very important to have someone who will lend a hand. And when the foot of the enemy enters your house, he will lend you a helping hand. On the morning of February 24, I had no doubt who it would be. Who will say to me: \"Brother, your people will not be left alone with the enemy.\" And so it happened. And I'm grateful for that. Polish brothers and sisters are with us. And this is natural. Just in one day, on the first day of the war, it became clear to me and to all Ukrainians, and, I am sure, to all Poles that there are no more borders between us, between our nations. No physical ones. No historical ones. No personal ones. During the 16 days of this war, Ukrainian pride and Polish honor, Ukrainian courage in battles and Polish sincerity in helping us allow me to say very important words now. Words that there is real peace between our nations. Peace between relatives. Peace between brothers. And now I really want these words to be heard by our common Belarusian neighbors. Peace between relatives, peace between neighbors, peace between brothers. We have to come to this with them as well! We will definitely come! Dear Sirs! Polish brothers and sisters! For a long time, various \"stakeholders\" tried to create an impression that Ukrainians and Poles live differently. And separately. Why did they do all this? I will recall the words of President of the Republic of Poland Lech Kaczyński said in Tbilisi in 2008: \"We know very well: today - Georgia, tomorrow - Ukraine, the day after tomorrow - the Baltic countries and then, perhaps, the time will come for my country - Poland”. On February 24, this terrible \"tomorrow\" for Ukraine came, which President Kaczyński spoke about. And today we are fighting for such a bad time for Poland and the Baltic States to never come. We fight together. We have strength. Remember, there are 90 million of us together! We can do everything together. And this is the historical mission, the historical mission of Poland, the historical mission of Ukraine to be leaders who together will pull Europe out of this abyss, save it from this threat, stop the transformation of Europe into a victim. Dear Sirs! We can do it. We saw yesterday what the countries of the European Union talked about and in what manner. We saw who was the real leader and fought for a strong Europe. For common European security. And who tried to stop us, tried to stop you. We understand why it is so important for Poles to fight with us. Together with all those who are for freedom. For us and for you, for Europe. We remember the terrible tragedy of 2010 near Smolensk. We remember all the facts of the investigation into the circumstances of this catastrophe. We feel what this means for you. And what does the silence of those who also know all this mean to you, but... But they still feast their eyes on Russia. Polish brothers and sisters! I feel that we have already formed an extremely strong alliance. Even though it is informal. But this is an alliance that grew out of reality, not words on paper. Of the warmth in our hearts, not of the speeches of politicians at summits. Of the way you treated our people. Ukrainians who fled to your country to escape from the evil that came to our land. More than one and a half million citizens of Ukraine! The vast majority are women and children. They do not feel like they are in a strange land. You met our people in your families. With Polish delicacy. With fraternal kindness. Although we did not ask for it. And you did not ask anything for it. It's just the way it is between relatives. That's why I address so simply: friend Andrzej, dear Agata! That's why I claim that we have already united. We united to constantly gain and create freedom, as a great Pole, a close friend of Ukraine John Paul II said. Today, I cannot be sure of all the leaders of all European nations, but I am sure that we will definitely be with you in defending freedom. As much as needed. I am grateful for all the help we have already received from your state, from your people. I am grateful for your efforts so that we can secure the Ukrainian sky. I believe that we will be able to achieve the result in this, the result that we all desperately need. If God allows and we win this war, we will share the victory with our brothers and sisters. This is our greatness. And your greatness. This is a struggle for our freedom, this is a struggle for your freedom. This is the common history of great nations! May God help us win!"

  "speech": "Strong people of the steel country! This is how the militaries answer the Kremlin command's question about what prevented them from capturing Ukraine in four days. Strong people of the steel country. This information is unverified, but this fact is indisputable. And if the lost invaders justify their failures with something else, it means that during the 16 days of the war they did not understand anything. Well, we don’t take it so hard. We are ready to explain. Enlighten the invaders until they fully understand who they are and where exactly they should go. Go out of Ukraine. Today in Melitopol the invaders captured mayor of the city Ivan Fedorov. A mayor who courageously defends Ukraine and the people of his community. Obviously, this is a sign of the weakness of the invaders. They did not find any support on our land. Although they counted on it. Because for years they have been lying to themselves that people in Ukraine were supposedly waiting for Russia to come. They did not find collaborators who would hand over the city and the power to the invaders. Therefore, they have switched to a new stage of terror, when they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of the legitimate local Ukrainian authorities. It is clear to any democratic state in the world that a legitimately elected mayor is a true representative of the people. Usually it's not about ideology, it's not about politics, it's about the lives of people in a particular community. Probably Russia has become accustomed to this during the years of autocratic rule. Perhaps they believe that the mayor is just a boss which is easy to remove, and it means nothing. But it is Ukraine here. It is Europe here. It is a democratic world here. Therefore, the capture of the mayor of Melitopol is a crime not only against a particular person. Not only against a particular community. And not only against Ukraine. This is a crime against democracy as such. I assure you that one hundred percent of people in all democracies will know this. The actions of the Russian invaders will be equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists. The whole country saw that Melitopol did not surrender to the invaders. Just as Kherson, Berdyansk and other cities where Russian troops managed to enter didn’t. Temporarily managed to enter. And this will NOT be changed by putting pressure on mayors or kidnapping mayors. This can only get worse. For the invaders. Ukraine demands the immediate release of the mayor of Melitopol and guarantees of full security to all heads of communities across the country. If you are becoming an analogue of ISIS terrorists, then what is the point of talking to you about something at all? We will raise this issue, including in talks with international mediators who communicate with Moscow. Today, Russian troops also disrupted the work of most humanitarian corridors. But, despite everything, 7,144 people were saved. From Enerhodar, Bucha, Hostomel and Kozarovychi. And these are 7,144 reasons to try to organize evacuation for Ukrainians from the besieged cities tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. We will do that. We will do everything to bring humanitarian aid to Ukrainian cities. I have to say this with pain - Mariupol remains blocked by the enemy. Russian troops did not let our aid into the city and continue to torture our people, our Mariupol residents. Tomorrow we'll try again. Once again send food, water and medicine for our city. I am confident that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will respond to every minute of our people's suffering. And it's not pathos. Not a threat. This is a statement of reality. The number of killed Russian servicemen on the territory of Ukraine already exceeds 12 thousand people. 12 thousand! The number of wounded invaders is many times bigger. We did not invite any of them here. And we repeat to each of the invaders: you can still save yourself. At any moment. Just lay down your weapons and go home, leave our land. The number of captured invaders has already reached such a level that this issue cannot be left to the structures that we had before the war. Therefore, today the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine established the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Thousands of enemy soldiers who have been captured or surrendered receive from our state the treatment required by international conventions. But there are so many of them that a special structure is needed to deal with all related issues. I want to say it again for Russian mothers. Especially for mothers of conscripts. Do not send your children to war in a foreign land. Do not believe the promises that they will be sent just somewhere for exercises or just somewhere in non-combat conditions. Check where your son is. And if you have even the slightest suspicion that your son may be sent to the war against Ukraine, act immediately. Do not give your son to death or captivity. Ukraine never wanted this dreadful war. And Ukraine doesn’t want it. But it will defend as much as necessary. Fortunately, we are not alone in this battle. Ukrainians have sincere friends. Good partners. Speaking in the Polish Parliament today, I paid a lot of attention to the importance of not being alone in today's world. How important it is to protect common values. And as a result - to feel that the borders between nations are blurred. To make people closer. Just like our relationship with Polish brothers and sisters. Just like our relationship with all our sincere partners. Because the one who has friends can do anything. I held talks with US President Biden. We discussed how else we can put pressure on Russia to end this war and establish peace. Russia will be deprived of the opportunity to trade normally with the G7 countries. The less dollars Russian business earns and the less taxes the Russian state receives, the less opportunity the Russian military will have to kill our people. Leading international companies are already leaving the Russian market. The Russian government has put its country outside the global world by starting a war against us. By starting this invasion. This is self-closure. Self-humiliation. Self-destruction. In Moscow currency exchange offices, the dollar has already reached 200 rubles. And this is just the beginning. The beginning of international sanctions. The next step is the United States’ ban on bringing dollars into Russia. Consequently, there will be a shortage of currency. So, the course will raise even more. Consequently, prices will rise. Consequently, every citizen of Russia will feel that the absence of peace is a threat to him personally. Not a single country in the world wished harm to ordinary citizens of Russia. Nobody tried to cause any damage until your government started a war with neighbors, peaceful people. A war of annihilation. No one wanted to return ordinary Russian life back to the \"wicked 1990s\". Is that what you call that era? A time of upheaval and poverty. A time of very limited opportunities for ordinary people and very large inequalities. Perhaps now, due to the efforts of propagandists, most Russians do not yet understand what awaits them. But the Russian authorities ALREADY understand this very well. Very clear. And they are very afraid. That is why they are trying to close all free sources of information. Actually all sources of information. Even Instagram and Facebook. But the modern world has learned to deal with such censorship. My advice to thinking Russians is to look for ways to get truthful information. And try to hide your smartphones and computers from the security forces on the streets. They're getting ready to check what's in people's phones. What do people have in laptops. I specifically warn you: learn to resist the repression that your government plans to increase. Because thinking people should be in every country. And in Russia, too. And they are in Russia. And one more thing. Now the good news and the victories of Ukraine for all of us are worth their weight in gold. Or silver and bronze. And all this - for Ukraine - is successfully won by our Paralympians in Beijing. Today, everyone is gaining glory for Ukraine. In his or her place. Shows the world who Ukrainians are and what strength we have. With a weapon in hands on the battlefield or with a sporting rifle on a biathlon track. Our boys and girls have already won 25 medals at the Winter Paralympics! And take second place in the overall standings, second only to the hosts of the competition - China. The Paralympics will end in two days. I would very much like to say the same about the war. That it will end in two days. Unfortunately, this is still unrealistic. But it will definitely happen. Both victory for Ukraine and peace for Ukraine are achievable. And they will be more valuable for us than gold, silver and bronze of the whole world. Well, for now ... Hold our ground! Hold on! We will win! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Brave people of the unconquered country! From the very morning in the Ukrainian - forever Ukrainian - Melitopol people, our citizens, gathered for the regular protest action against the Russian troops. Against the attempts to put the city to its knees. More than two thousand people in the square. Do you hear it, Moscow? If 2,000 people are protesting against the occupation in Melitopol, how many people should be in Moscow against the war? To make it fair. Yesterday the invaders captured the mayor of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov. The city community is demanding his release. And this is very important. I am grateful to every Melitopol resident for this resistance, for this position. The invaders must see that they are strangers on our land, on all our land of Ukraine, and they will never be accepted. Throughout the night and today we constantly talk to our partners about this situation with our mayor. The demand is simple - to release him from captivity immediately. We appeal to all world leaders who speak to Moscow. France, Germany, Israel and others. I have personally called German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron. I will talk to everyone to free our people. We expect them, the world leaders, to show how they can influence the situation. How they can do a simple thing - free one person. A person who represents the entire Melitopol community, Ukrainians who do not give up. Our Armed Forces are doing everything to deprive the enemy of any desire to continue the war against Ukraine. The losses of Russian troops are enormous. The dynamics of the invaders’ losses on the 17th day is such that it is safe to say that this is the biggest blow to the Russian army in decades. They’ve never lost more than that in such a time period. Since the beginning of the invasion, 31 battalion tactical groups of the enemy have lost their combat capability. The Russian militaries are being taken prisoners not just alone, but in groups. Groups are trying to leave Ukraine and come back to Russia as well. The losses of the invaders in technical capabilities are simply astounding. More than 360 tanks. 1205 armored vehicles. And that's without counting the losses in the battles this night and in the morning. Already almost 60 planes. More than 80 helicopters. Hundreds and hundreds of units of other equipment, including the most modern models, of which Russia is proud. Most of the world's armies do not have as much as Russian troops lost during the invasion. Ukrainians! I want you to understand me correctly. We have had extraordinary success. The resistance of the entire Ukrainian people against these invaders has already gone down in history. But we have no right to reduce the intensity of defense. No matter how difficult it is. We have no right to reduce the energy of resistance. The enemy is bringing new and new columns to the territory of Ukraine. They are looking everywhere for fighters. Reservists. Conscripts. Mercenaries. They are trying to take us with numbers. The number of fighters, the number of equipment. They use terror to break our faith in victory and in Ukraine. I'm sure they won't succeed. It will not work for them. But in order for them not to succeed, we still have to fight. We still need to be focused. All of us, all Ukrainians, still need to continue to focus on defense. Work together. Without internal split. Supporting each other. All over the country. From Uzhhorod to Melitopol. From Chernihiv to Mariupol. From Lviv to Kharkiv. Just like we all have been doing for 17 days of the war. Today we again sent humanitarian aid to Mariupol. We will try every day to save our people. I am grateful to every driver who tries to accomplish this difficult mission. I am grateful to the representatives of the church who joined the efforts to protect the humanitarian corridor in Mariupol from shelling. Ukrainian troops, for their part, guarantee complete \"silence\" along the entire route so that Mariupol receives food, water and medicine. And so that the civilians of Mariupol can go to a safe area. Humanitarian corridors from Makariv, Borodyanka, Trostyanets, Sumy, Poltava, Lebedyn, Konotop, Velyka Pysarivka, Krasnopillya, Polohy, Tokmak, Hostomel, Kozarovychi, Mykulychi and Andriivka of the Kyiv region have also been prepared. The Russian side must ensure \"silence\" on each of these routes. Otherwise, what can Russia guarantee in any negotiations? We continue to work with Europeans in two directions. The first is Ukraine's accession to the European Union. We are working with the European Commission to agree on all procedures for our movement towards the EU as soon as possible. The second direction is sanctions, it is the top priority. We look forward to a new package of European sanctions against Russia to force it to peace. To make it clear: their economy simply will not survive this war. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has made several very important decisions. The complete abolition of value added tax and excise duty for fuel was approved. For gasoline, for diesel. This is done not only in the context of the sowing campaign, which should start as usual, but also in the context of the needs of all citizens. So that there is no shortage of fuel in the country. So that prices are stable. The government has done its part. Now it's up to the deputies. They must immediately adopt this decision by their vote. Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Ruslan Stefanchuk is already organizing the relevant sitting. The second component is to support those Ukrainian communities that receive our migrants from the areas of hostilities. The government has decided to compensate local budgets for utilities payment when accommodating people. According to preliminary estimates, communities in at least ten regions of Ukraine will receive concrete money from the central government to ensure that all IDPs are provided with everything necessary. Ukrainians! Now all of us have to be efficient in our routine as well. We must do our job one hundred percent, help colleagues, take care of our loved ones. And at the same time we must provide everything necessary for our defense. For our defenders. This is a patriotic war. This is a people's war. This is a war for our independence. Independence of not just our state. But of everything Ukrainian that was, is and will be in the world. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Greetings to all friends of Ukraine!Greetings to all friends of Europe, all friends of freedom! I know that there are over a hundred thousand of you all over the world today. More than a hundred thousand in the squares of different cities. We, Ukrainians, are grateful for this. And now I ask each of you to remember one number in each square... 79. You will understand what this means. I will tell you now what it means for our lives, for each of us. I will tell all one hundred thousand and millions who will hear us afterwards. We are experiencing a terrible war in Ukraine. Europe has not seen such a war since World War II. We did not start this war. This is a brutal and cynical Russian invasion of Ukrainian land. This is a war against the Ukrainian people - against peaceful and sincere people, whom I am sure you have known very well during the years of our independence. And you saw that we are very similar to you. We equally value freedom. We equally value equality. We equally want to live. We just want to live. We equally want only the best, the brightest for our children, for our families. But now we and you live differently. Now when the war is going on and thousands of people have died in it! And 79 children have died in it. 79 children! I'm sure each of you has photos of your loved ones. At home or just on the phone so you can watch when your heart asks for that. Photos of children, photos of parents. Photos of your loved ones. We don't even realize it, but we always know that these photos are not the last. Because we believe that we will see how those who are dearest to us will live. We’ll see how happy our loved ones are. How our children grow up, how they go to university, how they work. How they have their children. And then we will play with our grandchildren. Meet them after school, have dinner together. Everyone in the millions lives with that hope. Hope for a truly peaceful life. For new photos, new memories, new moments of happiness, which our state, Ukraine, is deprived of now. While the war continues, we are in fundamentally different conditions with you. When you can be sure that you and your loved ones have a long future ahead, a normal future. And we want that. And we are happy for you. And for us, what we have may be the last time. Just one last time. Today and never again. As for 79 Ukrainian children. 79 Ukrainian families. Destroyed by this shameful war - the invasion of Russia. 79 families who have lost the most valuable, but who are still forced to fight. They are forced to pull themselves up and survive. And fight. Fight for a future that is over for them. In those photos of 79 children killed in the war. And what should we do... All of us - the Ukrainian people, Europeans - so that this number 79 does not change, does not grow. And so that Europe does not forget Ukraine-79. Russian troops besiege Ukrainian cities. They are trying to destroy them. Imagine! Entire cities! In 2022! In Europe. Our Mariupol, the largest Ukrainian city on the coast of the Sea of Azov, is under complete blockade. It is bombed around the clock. Russian troops drop air bombs on it and fire missiles. They even bombed a maternity hospital and a children’s hospital in Mariupol... This is hatred of all mankind. They kill children and destroy maternity hospitals and children's hospitals. Why? So that Ukrainian women don't even give birth? And this is all over our country, all over Ukraine, which is suffering from the Russian invasion. They have already destroyed dozens of hospitals, hundreds of schools and kindergartens. They are destroying universities. Completely destroying residential areas with carpet bombing. Imagine what it is! And how to survive in this? What does it mean for Ukrainians, for our families, for our children? What does it mean when you can't find peace even in church. Because aviation bombs even churches! Even squares... The same squares as yours... Where you are listening to me now. They bombed the square in our city of Kharkiv - Freedom Square. This is the largest square in Europe, which is no different from your squares. Except that it is destroyed. Destroyed by a Russian missile strike. I am constantly asked in interviews: how can Europe help Ukraine? I formulate the question differently, namely: how can Europe help itself? Because this is a war not only against our people, not only against Ukrainians. This is a war against the values that unite us. Against our ability to live. Live, not kill like the Russian military on our land. Do you feel why we are different from them? We live. And they kill. We are 79 lives. And they are 79 deaths. I am sure that you want to stop the war just like every Ukrainian. That is why my answer about the help that is needed for Ukraine sounds logical, natural to millions of people in democracies. You need to put pressure. Such sanctions against Russia are needed so that every Russian soldier knows the price of every shot at civilians. We need such principles of European business that the Russian state does not have the money to ruin lives. Put pressure on the companies in your countries to leave Russia, so that you are not indirect sponsors of this war and tragedy. Tell your politicians to close the sky over Ukraine from Russian missiles and planes. From those who killed 79 children and thousands of adults! Thousands in 17 days... All this will protect us. We are just like you. Absolutely the same! You know that. You feel it. You see me and you understand all this. And you know that we must be together in the European community. This is extremely important for Ukraine. And this is very important for you, for Europe. Because this will strengthen Europe. This will protect Europe. This will stop the war forever. This will prove that the 79 lives taken in the war for freedom have not been lost in vain. That they are alive. That they live among us. And they are among other children of Ukraine and Europe, who will be able to be free, will be able to dream, will be able to just live as they want. In peace. And not to be afraid that they may be killed. And not to look for the nearest air bomb shelter. Just as you are not looking for it - each of the hundred thousand in the squares of European cities that are listening to me now. And just as millions who, I'm sure, will hear me. Hear about Ukraine-79. About Ukraine-2022. About Ukraine, which seeks peace. And about Europe, for which it is time to choose. Choose Ukraine. For the sake of peace! For the sake of all of us. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Wise people of a strong country! The 17th day of the war is over. War for the right to be free. For the right to live on our land the way we, Ukrainians, want it. Not the way someone came up with for us. And against us. Against our nature. Against our character. The Russian invaders cannot conquer us. They do not have such strength. They do not have such spirit. They are holding only on violence. Only on terror. Only on weapons, which they have a lot. But the invaders have no natural basis for normal life. So that people can feel happy and dream. They are organically incapable of making life normal! Wherever Russia has come to a foreign land, dreams are impossible. Only a very hard struggle for survival. As a result of the attack on our land, on Ukraine, the Russian leadership is actually turning its state into an analogue of the so-called \"DPR\" and \"LPR\". Into a large area isolated from the rest of the world. Where poverty will reign. Where everything will be determined only by violence. And where people will flee. In any manner they can and whoever can. Look who is leaving Russia now. Who withdraws business. These are professionals who can be competitive at the global market. These are IT specialists who do not want to live in an area where there is no freedom. These are businessmen who feel that everything will be taken away from them at any moment. These are artists who know that creativity in a territory where human life is worthless is also worthless. Russia loses its brains. Loses talent. Loses money. But if this is happening to Russia, then what awaits the so-called \"DPR\" and \"LPR\"? Their analogues? Solely complete degradation. The invaders in the Kherson region are trying to repeat the notorious experience of the formation of pseudo-republics. Blackmail local leaders, put pressure on deputies. Look for someone to bribe. They’re trying to organize the so-called \"KPR\". Stillborn as \"DPR\" and \"LPR\". To organize some \"committees\" against the legitimate government on our land. And against the will of the people who go out to protest every day. And who want Ukraine. I am grateful to them. I want to tell some figures who lacked the disgust to refuse to talk to the invaders... I want to say - if some of them were suddenly tempted by proposals from the invaders... You sign your sentence. The sentence is to follow more than 12,000 invaders who failed to understand in time why Ukraine should not be encroached upon. An emergency meeting of the Kherson Regional Council took place. 44 deputies decided that the Kherson region is Ukraine, and no pseudo-republics have a place there. Ukraine will stand the test. We need time and strength to break the military machine that came to our land. I will not underestimate the threat. And I will not exaggerate the achievements. We are honest people, not Russia's Ministry of Defense. Which lies to everyone - millions of its citizens and even the head of the Russian Federation. So I say frankly: we still need to hold on. We still have to fight. Every day and every night we must look for ways to cause maximum damage to the enemy. In all areas of defense. Near Zhytomyr and Kyiv, near Chernihiv and Sumy, near Kharkiv and Luhansk, near Donetsk and Mariupol, in the south of the country and on the diplomatic frontline. Having such tactics and having self-confidence, we will regain what’s ours. We will come to Melitopol and Henichesk. We will come wherever our land is. And let the invaders know. Let all the collaborators they find know. That Ukraine will not forgive them. Nobody. Nothing. Ukraine will not forget. Ukraine will find and prosecute. Every single one. In any possible way. By the way, all humanitarian corridors, which were agreed upon, worked. 12,729 people were evacuated. The humanitarian cargo for Mariupol is to arrive tomorrow afternoon. Due to the complexity of the route they had to spend the night in Berdyansk. On every occasion, I constantly repeat to our friends and partners abroad that they should do more for Ukraine, for Ukrainians. Because it is not only for Ukraine. This is for everyone in Europe. Evil that purposefully bombs peaceful cities... Evil that fires even at ambulances and blows up hospitals will not be able to stop at one country. If it has the strength to go further. I said this at a very important rally in support of our people, which was organized in Europe. More than a hundred thousand people in the squares of Italy and other countries of the continent gathered for a rally in support of Ukraine and against Russian aggression. Millions of people heard my appeal later thanks to broadcasts and recordings. We now enjoy the greatest support in the history of Ukraine for our aspirations and our independence. You can take a public opinion poll in any country and you will see that Ukraine is among the leaders of those who are sympathized with and supported. And Russia is not just among enemies. It is even a bigger enemy, bigger evil than North Korea. That's what Americans think, for example. Ordinary people in all states. As well as ordinary people in all European countries. And I am grateful to them for this extraordinary support. Grateful for understanding our struggle. Because we are united by one dream - to live freely on our land. And we have the right to what everyone has in the free world. To a safe sky, as well as to our own land. Dear Ukrainians! Our heroes! The world has always loved those who fight against evil. It was our resistance, the courage of all our people that inspired the world. Millions of people in different countries. Who 17 days ago might not have felt what they all have in common. We all have. And now it's obvious. Peace. Freedom. And love for our children. The children we are fighting for. For them to have a future. I signed two important decrees. On awarding 106 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who bravely showed themselves in the battles for the independence of Ukraine. 17 of them, unfortunately, posthumously. But they are heroes. the decree on conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine with the award of the Order of the Golden Star to: Senior Sergeant Vasich Serhiy Viktorovych. Posthumously. He bravely defended our positions in the Kyiv region. Destroyed enemy equipment and a significant amount of enemy manpower. Senior soldier Parkhomuk Vitaliy Vasyliovych. Posthumously. During the counterattack on the enemy near the city of Makariv, he inflicted significant losses on the enemy and died heroically defending his brothers-in-arms. Soldier Mrochko Kostiantyn Vasyliovych. Posthumously. He fought bravely against the overwhelming forces of the enemy. Thanks to his effective actions, the invaders suffered painful losses. Soldier Svynchuk Oleh Anatoliyovych. Posthumously. He heroically performed his duty in the battle against the overwhelming forces of the enemy. He was helping his brothers-in-arms until the last moment. Sergeant Khanin Andriy Pavlovych. Posthumously. Defending Volnovakha, Donetsk region, he destroyed an enemy tank and about 10 enemies. During the battle, when he was wounded, he helped his wounded brothers-in-arms and performed his duty to the last. Sergeant Derusova Inna Mykolaivna. Posthumously. Since February 24, the senior combat medic has performed tasks in the city of Okhtyrka, Sumy region. She saved more than 10 servicemen, risking her own life. She died from artillery shelling by Russian troops, helping the wounded. The first woman - hero of Ukraine, who was posthumously awarded this title. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! The title of Hero of Ukraine with the Order of the Golden Star is conferred upon: Senior Lieutenant Hutsul Volodymyr Oleksandrovych. Thanks to his heroic actions in the Kherson region, 25 units of enemy equipment and about 300 invaders were destroyed. Senior Lieutenant Chornyi Volodymyr Volodymyrovych. Thanks to his skilful actions during the defense of Volnovakha, Donetsk region, about 50 enemies and a T-72 tank were destroyed, as well as 5 invaders were captured. Glory to all heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Strong people of an unbreakable country! Today is the 18th day. The 18th day of our war for life, for Ukraine, for independence. The beginning of this day was black. Russian missiles and air bombs hit our country again. From east to west. 30 missiles for the Lviv region alone. The shelling of the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security killed 35 people and wounded 134 others. Nothing was happening there that could threaten the territory of the Russian Federation. And only 20 kilometers away are NATO borders. Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war. We were right. I have been saying for a long time that Nord Stream is a weapon that will hit Europe. Now it's obvious. And now I repeat again - if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries. An American journalist was killed in the Kyiv region today. Brent Renaud. His colleague was wounded. It was a deliberate attack by the Russian military. They knew what they were doing. But not everyone in the West seems to know what they are doing. In the east of our country, the invaders decided to \"demilitarize\" and \"denazify\" the Sviatohirsk Lavra of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Moscow Patriarchate. At the time of the attack, only monks and hundreds of refugees were on the territory of the monastery. No military target in or near the monastery. But Russian troops do not stop even before striking at the monastery. This fact alone demonstrates that the whole ideology of the Russian state is simply a lie. Today I visited our guys, our defenders who are recovering from wounds at a military hospital. We talked. I presented awards. Orders and medals - for courage, for glory for Ukraine. And I really want my greeting \"I wish you good health\" to work today as powerfully as our Armed Forces have been holding key frontiers. For 18 days already. By the way, the Russian military from Ryazan is being treated in the same hospital. He is in the same ward with our defenders. Gets the same aid. From the same doctors. Despite what this guy was doing. Against us, against Ukraine. But Ukrainian doctors saved him. And this is obvious. Because they are people. Not savages. And we have to go through this war so that we all remain human. I am grateful to all the doctors and nurses who work in Kyiv and Dnipro, in Vinnytsia and Lviv, in Chernihiv and Donbas, in Kharkiv, in Melitopol, in Mariupol... Everyone! Mariupol Military Hospital. Pokrovsk Military Mobile Hospital. Chasiv Yar Military Mobile Hospital. Military Medical Clinical Center of the Eastern Region. Cherkaske Military Hospital. Military Medical Clinical Center of the Central Region, Vinnytsia. Military Medical Clinical Center of the Western Region, Lviv. Military Medical Rehabilitation Center, left Irpen, but continues to work. Sincere gratitude! From all of us. From all Ukrainians. I also visited checkpoints today. I didn't want it to be very public. Just to support our guys. To talk. Courageous men, cheerful guys. Who defend Kyiv and know that WE will win. It is felt. We will win due to our unique ability to unite. We can always care for our people. Ours in spirit, in heart, in sincerity. I met an extraordinary person there at the checkpoint who supports our defenders every day and brings them a pot of borscht every day. Really delicious! Truly Ukrainian. Wholeheartedly. And I know that our state has been based on such people for centuries. It is thanks to such people that we will survive any dark days. Because we are together. And we always protect our own people. And our own property. NOT for money. Without coercion. NOT like those who came to us. Just because we are Ukrainians. Important international negotiations. Bulgaria, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Romania, Poland, Britain. We feel the support of these countries. We feel the support for our army. It is important. I also spoke with Charles Michel, President of the European Council. About our European perspective, which is becoming a reality. Now about the negotiations with the Russian Federation. Representatives of our countries’ delegations speak in video format every day. Our delegation has a clear task - to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for. Obviously this is a difficult story. A hard path. But this path is needed. And our goal is for Ukraine to get the necessary result in this struggle, in this negotiation work. Necessary for peace. And for security. So that we have guarantees - normal, effective. NOT like the Budapest ones and not like in our sky. So that Ukrainians could say: this is what works. These are the guarantees. It is necessary to talk. More than ten humanitarian corridors worked. Kyiv region, Luhansk region... 5550 people were saved in one day. In six days - more than 130,000. It is necessary to talk. And this is also due to negotiations. We have to understand that. Unfortunately, the humanitarian corridor to Mariupol was blocked. Again. We did everything necessary. Ensured \"silence\". Russian troops disrupted the movement of cargo and buses. But we will try again. Until we can help our people. Because they are ours. Our Mariupol. Heroic Mariupol. Ukrainians! We are going through the worst ordeal in our history. In our lives. We protect the most precious thing we have. We must hold on. We must fight. And we will win. I know that. I believe in that. Glory to you! Glory to our people! Glory to our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! Good weather, which we now almost do not notice. Clear sky... There is no such thing over Kyiv today. Over Kyiv and other cities of our state. Due to missile strikes, traces of enemy aircraft. The streets are quiet, but I know, I believe it's not for long. Not forever. That's why we work. That is why we fight. That's why we don't give what’s ours. Today we celebrate our purely Ukrainian holiday. Volunteer Day. It is our ability to instantly unite during ordeals, find common ground and fight together that creates our character, Ukrainian character. We may not notice each other in everyday life. Agree, this happens to us. But when we see a threat to our way of life, to our spirit, when we see a threat to Ukraine, our state, we do not hesitate even for a moment. If we are Ukrainians. We unite. We do everything to protect what’s ours. Ukrainians do not need to be persuaded to become volunteers. Ukrainians do not need to be encouraged to start helping each other. Strong support for the Armed Forces by all the people of Ukraine, sincere volunteer movement, mass joining the territorial defense, solidarity of all our people - these are the prerequisites for victory. Prerequisites for the liberation of our entire country... The only and the best. For us, Ukraine is not just a territory, as for the invaders. They do not distinguish anything here. They do not understand anything. That is why for them everything is just a target. For us, Ukraine is millions of happy moments, native symbols, memorable places. We feel this land. For us, Ukraine is our life, and that is why millions of people have come to the defense of our state today. That is why today we are all volunteers. All those who defend Ukraine, our children, those who defend our future. To all who feel this free call... A call to defend Ukraine... Who are volunteers in battles. Or in the information troops. Who protects roads and cities. All diplomats - official and informal. Everyone who helps with technology. Who keeps the business. Who supplies the necessary goods, products. Who saves and heals under any circumstances. Who works in transport. Who provides communication and repairs networks... I am grateful to everyone. And I sincerely congratulate you! Each of the volunteers. Each of the millions working together to win. The 19th day of our resistance. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are holding on bravely. And creatively. We inflict such losses on the enemy that he no longer knows where else to look for reserves. Where else to look for help. Help for himself. Help for the invader. This is pathetic. But we have no right to relax. The Russian state has been preparing for war for decades. They have accumulated significant military resources. For the evil. For the conquest of neighbors. And for the destruction of Ukraine, Europe, as we know it, as we value it. That's why we have to hold on. We have to fight. To win. To come to the peace deserved by Ukrainians. Fair peace. With security guarantees for our state. For our people. And to put it on paper. In negotiations. Difficult negotiations. The video meeting of the delegations has already started today. It continues. Everyone is waiting for the news. We will definitely report in the evening. As long as the state is at war, as long as the people are defending themselves, the economy must be preserved and restored. As much as possible in the current difficult conditions. Life must appear on the streets of the cities. Where security allows. Where people can provide it. Pharmacies, trade, any business that can work. For the country to live. For the restoration of Ukraine to already begin. And it depends on each of us, on each of us who is able to work. Economic suppression of Ukraine is one of the tasks of the war against us. And we have to fight back from that as well. Save our economy. Save our people. Therefore, the government has received a clear instruction - to return small and medium-sized businesses. Remove any obstacles. Reduce taxes as much as possible, remove all difficulties, absolutely all. So that the system does not press, so that people know that they can work the way they can. Where they can. A new tax model is needed for the war and for the post-war development. The financial rules also need to be updated. To make people feel that they can be flexible. Feel that all the money and valuables will be saved. And that you shouldn’t be afraid of losing something, because the state guarantees the security of assets and savings. The Cabinet of Ministers is already working on how to regulate this. A day or two - and there will be details. Ukrainians! Russian troops continue to destroy our infrastructure, continue to destroy our cities. Kyiv region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Kharkiv, south, Donbas. But know - we will rebuild everything. We will restore everything. Every street of every city. Every house, every apartment of every Ukrainian. After the war, I'm sure we can do it quickly. We will direct all our efforts to this. All the help of the world. We are already creating funds for Ukraine to live. But now that the invaders are still on our land, we must beat them as best as we can. Drive them away in any way we can. Defend the cities. Defend the villages. Defend every meter of our land. And every part of our heart. Ukrainian heart. Ukrainian soul. Help each other! Support each other! Support the defense! And protect the state! Together we will definitely win. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Free people of a free country! The 19th day of our resistance is over. Historical war. Another difficult day, which is still approaching our victory. Approaching peace for Ukraine. As before, the enemy is confused. They did not expect such resistance. They believed in their propaganda, which has been lying about us for decades.They still can't recollect themselves. But they have already begun to understand that they will not achieve anything by war. Their soldiers know this. Their officers are aware of this. They flee the battlefield. They abandon equipment. We take trophies and use them to protect Ukraine. Today, Russian troops are, in fact, one of the suppliers of equipment to our army. They could not imagine such a thing in a nightmare. And I want to tell the Russian soldiers. Those who have already entered our land. And who are just about to be sent to fight against us. Russian conscripts! Listen to me very carefully. Russian officers! You’ve already understood everything. You will not take anything from Ukraine. You will take lives. There are a lot of you. But your life will also be taken. But why should you die? What for? I know that you want to survive. We hear your conversations in the intercepts, we hear what you really think about this senseless war, about this disgrace and about your state. Your conversations with each other. Your calls home to your family. We hear it all. We draw conclusions. We know who you are. Therefore, I offer you a choice. On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance. Chance to survive. If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated. As people, decently. In a way you were not treated in your army. And in a way your army does not treat ours. Choose! Our brave defenders continue to inflict devastating losses on Russian troops. Soon the number of downed helicopters of Russia will reach hundreds of units. They have already lost 80 warplanes. Hundreds of tanks and thousands of other units of equipment. In 19 days, the Russian army has lost more in Ukraine than in two bloody and years-long wars in Chechnya. For what? I am grateful to those Russians who do not stop trying to convey the truth. To those who fight disinformation and tell the truth, real facts to their friends and loved ones. And personally to the woman who entered the studio of Channel One with a poster against the war. To those who are not afraid to protest. As long as your country has not completely closed itself off from the whole world, turning into a very large North Korea, you must fight. You must not lose your chance. The European Union has approved the fourth package of sanctions against Russia. The fourth - and I'm sure not the last. We are working with partners on new restrictions that will be applied against the Russian state. Everyone who is responsible for the war. Everyone who is responsible for the destruction of democracy. Everyone who is responsible for repression against people. Everyone will get an answer. The answer of the world. And this is just the beginning. Responsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable. Responsibility for a deliberate humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities is inevitable. The whole world sees what is happening in Mariupol. Kharkiv. Chernihiv. Sumy. Okhtyrka. Hostomel. Irpin. In all our cities. All our partners are informed of the crimes of the invaders against civilians and local self-government in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. In the temporarily occupied areas. There will be an answer for that. Necessarily. For the disrupted humanitarian corridors. Necessarily. During the day of March 14, 3,806 Ukrainians were evacuated from the cities and towns of the Kyiv and Luhansk regions.  Our convoy with one hundred tons of what is most necessary for Mariupol is still kept in Berdyansk. For three days already. But we will try. We will do everything to ensure that Mariupol residents receive food, water and medicine. I provided full information about the actions of the invaders on the Ukrainian land in conversations with friends and partners of our state. Every aggressive action of the invaders only pushes the world to new sanctions. I spoke with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. With President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel. We have 100% mutual understanding. The conversation with Prime Minister of Israel Bennett was also important. As part of a negotiation effort to end this war as soon as possible. With a fair peace. Our delegation also worked on this in negotiations with the Russian party. Pretty good, as I was told. But let's see. They will continue tomorrow. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has agreed on a package of decisions to support our economy. So that business works. So that people have jobs. Where security allows. Where people are ready for it. First, we are starting tax reform. Instead of VAT and income tax we give a rate of 2 percent of turnover and simplified accounting. For small businesses - this is the first and second group of sole proprietors - we set a voluntary payment of a single tax. That is, if you can - pay. You can't - no questions asked. The second is maximum business deregulation. We cancel all inspections for all businesses. So that everyone works normally. So that the cities come to life. So that life continues wherever there is no hostilities. The only condition is that you ensure the normal operation of your business in the framework of Ukrainian law. These are just the first two steps of our tax reform. To be continued. And finally. I have just signed a decree on awarding state awards of Ukraine to 234 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who showed personal courage and heroism in the fight for our land. For our independence. 59 of them posthumously. May the memory of everyone who gave life for our state live forever! Eternal gratitude to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Strong people of our indomitable country! Eight years of war against us. The 20th day of full-scale invasion. Attempts to destroy us all, to destroy Ukraine. We are fighting for our lives. We are fighting for our lives against missiles, bombs, artillery, tanks, mortars and everything else that Russian troops are using to destroy us. Everything else that Russia is destroying itself with now. Because every shot at Ukraine, every blow at Ukraine are steps towards Russia's self-destruction. Steps to self-isolation, poverty and degradation. Everyone who just wants to live and has something to think with is leaving Russia. Scientists, artists, businessmen, IT specialists, etc. The Russian state has not experienced such a blow at human capital for decades. A blow, which it inflicted on itself. We do not care. This is not our problem. Our problem is to save our people. The strength of our society. Its scientists, its artists, its businessmen, its people, its strong people. All our Ukrainians who defend the state and bring closer the peace that every Ukrainian needs. Last night there were air alarms almost all over our country. The airport in Dnipro was destroyed by a missile strike. Kharkiv. Russian bombs hit residential areas. Artillery. Mortars. Fighting continues in the region - Izyum, Chuhuiv. Disassembly of wreckage in Rivne after the missile strike on the TV tower is ongoing. As of now, 19 casualties are confirmed. Ancient Chernihiv and Oster are under such a brutal attack by Russia that it has wiped out any claims to its cultural ties to the times of Rus’. The invaders have no roots, no memory and no soul. Russian troops attacked Kyiv, attacked Kyiv residents. Four apartment buildings were destroyed. Disassembly of the debris is still ongoing. As of now, five casualties are confirmed. I will tell you in Russian: this happened in our capital. In the city that you always called “the mother of Russian cities”. That made our nations historical. And that you bombed today. Just people, residential areas. Bombed and bombed again. We don't need such children. No, thanks. The invaders continue to consider the capture of our capital as their key goal, their political goal. They hope that control over Kyiv will give them control over Ukraine. This is absolute absurdity from all points of view. To further strengthen the defense of the capital and the Kyiv region, I appointed Hero of Ukraine, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Joint Forces Operation Oleksandr Pavliuk head of the regional military administration. Dismissed head of the regional administration Oleksiy Kuleba will help the military leadership. Therefore, the Kyiv direction and the situation in the region will get even more attention. Major General Eduard Moskaliov became the new commander of the Joint Forces. Professional man, patriotic man. The decree is signed. Every morning, every evening, I thank the military. I thank all our heroes who bravely defend our state. All who stop the enemy despite the fact that the invaders are many times more. Dozens of times. And now, today, I want to speak about all peaceful Ukrainians who were taken away by this war. Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Eternal curse to the enemy who took thousands of lives. Humanitarian corridors have been partially opened today. There is a corridor from Sumy, Trostyanets, Lebedyn, Shostka and Konotop in the direction of Poltava. The invaders did not stop the shelling and disrupted humanitarian corridors in the Kyiv region. The convoy with humanitarian cargo for Mariupol also remains blocked. For several days in a row. But still little by little people are leaving the besieged city by private transport. I want to thank SES officers, police, doctors and everyone else who saves people for this important work. And of course, I am thankful to our military. Today I spoke at the summit organized by Great Britain, a friend of Ukraine - Boris Johnson. I addressed the United Kingdom Joint Expeditionary Force. Spoke to the leaders of the Baltic states and the countries of northern Europe. I said what, of course, all our citizens would like to say. About NATO. About help. About sincerity and... the fact that not everyone took a moral stance in response to the Russian war. Each of more than 800 Russian missiles that have hit our country is an answer to a long-standing question about NATO. Whether the doors of the Alliance are really open for Ukraine. If they were open, if it was fair, we would not have to convince the Alliance for 20 days that the sky over Ukraine should be closed. Closed to the death brought by the Russian Air Force. But... They don't hear or don't want to hear us yet. Some Allies have intimidated themselves. Saying that they allegedly can't answer. They cannot collide with Russian missiles and planes in the sky of Ukraine. Because this, they say, will lead to escalation, will lead to World War III... And what will they say if Russia goes further into Europe, attacking other countries? I'm sure it's the same thing they say to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO treaty has never been as weak as it is now. This is just our opinion. When some members of the Alliance are afraid to be truly an alliance capable of protecting everything for which it was created. Freedom and democracy. Humanity and justice. We need to look for effective guarantees. Guarantees for us, for our sky. And we will not give up. We need planes. And I will continue to talk about it, I will continue to pursue it. We need long-term security guarantees for the state. For all Ukrainians. Concrete things. Concrete guarantees. Legally enshrined. So that there is no doubt in them. And so that no excuses sound. As they sound now, when we turn to those who signed \"Budapest\" and who... had the power to stop the Russian invasion even before it began. Using preventive measures. By helping Ukraine, which is convincing. Using sanctions that do not allow war. Ukrainians! There are more than 40 million of us in our state. And millions more around the world. This is a great force. Plus our friends. Plus many of our partner countries. We all now have a common task, a national task. We must put pressure on Russia so that the price for this war against Ukraine becomes extremely painful. So that everyone in the world takes a moral stance. Not only states, but also companies. I'm talking about business. Large corporations that still sponsor Russia's military machine and have not left the Russian market, although they should have done so immediately. As soon as the world saw what Russian troops were doing on our Ukrainian land. You know these brands. They are well known. And there are no secrets here. Nestle, Mondelēz and other giants of the food industry. As well as Raiffeisen, Societe Generale and other banks. BASF, Samsung and LG. Bayer, Sanofi and other pharma companies. Unilever, Johnson & Johnson... And dozens of other companies. And that's billions of dollars. We turn to the world. To states and to people. But this is not just the work of politicians. I appeal to Ukrainians. To everyone and in any country. Where you can influence it. Everything is in your power. All business with Russia must be stopped. All trade operations. So that they can't sponsor the killings. Killings of us and our children. So that dollars and euros are not paid for blood. Please contact politicians. Put pressure. Talk to reporters. Boycott their products. They must feel our strength! They must feel your strength! Because we have the strength. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear speakers! Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Justin! Members of the government and parliament! Dear attendees, Dear friends! Before I begin, I want you to understand my feelings, the feelings of Ukrainians. As much as possible. Feelings during these 20 days. 20 days of full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation after eight years of war in Donbas. Just imagine... Imagine that at four in the morning each of you hears explosions. Terrible explosions. Justin, imagine that you hear it. And your children hear it. Hear missile strikes at Ottawa airport. At dozens of other places throughout your beautiful country, Canada. Cruise missiles. Even before dawn. And your children hug you and ask: “what happened, dad?” And you are already receiving the first reports on which facilities in your country have been destroyed by missiles of the Russian Federation. And you know how many people have already died and where. Imagine you are looking for words to explain this to children. Explain to them that a large-scale war has begun. The war aimed at the destruction of your state, at the conquest of your people. And you know it. The second day - and you get a message about the columns of armored vehicles. Thousands, thousands coming to your land. First - small cities, then larger ones. They want to block them all. And they do so. They approach Edmonton - imagine - and fire artillery. Fire at residential areas, at people. Schools are being burned down, kindergartens are being blown up. Just as in our cities - in Sumy, in our Okhtyrka. They blockade Vancouver and besiege hundreds of thousands of people who remain in the city. As in our Mariupol. For the second week under fire, without electricity completely, almost without food, definitely without water. In the basements. Justin! Dear attendees! Gentlemen! Imagine hearing the report on the dead every day. Yes, you are the president or the head of government, but you just hear about it, about the dead children. And the death toll is growing. 97 children were killed as of this morning. The famous CN Tower in Toronto... How many Russian missiles will be enough to destroy it? Believe me, I do not wish this to all of you... But we predict every day how many more missiles can hit our TV towers. And they hit them. Our Freedom Square in Kharkiv and your Churchill Square in Edmonton. Imagine Russian missiles hitting its heart. Our Babyn Yar is the burial place of the Holocaust victims... The Russians did not stop before bombing even this land. And what about the National Holocaust Monument in Ottawa? Will it withstand the impact of three or five missiles? It happened to us. Air bombs. A minute ago there were people alive. There was a family that just came there. They were alive. And now... You understand. And then a terrible night... each of these 20, when the Russian militaries fire from tanks at housing estates. From tanks - at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Direct guidance. When the fire started there. Can you imagine that happening to your Bruce Station in Ontario? And what would you feel if you saw your flag in every city where they pass, how your flag in Montreal is removed... Removed to be thrown away and replaced with a Russian one. I know that you support Ukraine, sincerely, effectively. We are friends with Justin. But I want you to understand me, and to feel it. Feel what we feel. Feel how we want to live. And how we want to win. Win for life. I want you to feel what it's like when you call your friends and say: close the sky, stop the shelling. No matter which way, just do it. Stop the bombing. How many more missiles must fall on our cities? And in response you hear that someone does not want to do it ... But they are deeply concerned! Then give us planes, we tell our partners. They answer: Soon. Be patient a little. Everyone is deeply concerned. They just don't want to. And someone is looking for reasons. The main thing is the result. They talk about escalation. How can it get worse? They say Ukraine is not in NATO now. Although \"the door is open\". But for whom are these doors and where do they lead, if we are told that we will not be admitted. War always shows everything people are capable of. Who is strong. And who is weak. Who is wise. Who does not see the obvious. Who is honest and who is a hypocrite. And we saw it all. And we understood all this. In 20 days and eight years. I'm sure you've seen it all. Dear speakers! Mr. Prime Minister! Members of the government. Members of parliament! Dear friends! Canada has always been, is and, I am sure, will be a reliable partner in Ukraine. Partner of our land, our people of Ukraine, each of our families. You came to our aid as soon as we asked for it. You are giving us the weapons and other support we so desperately need now. You have imposed sanctions against Russia - truly moral. Really substantial. However, we see that the war, unfortunately, continues. That Russian troops are not leaving our territory. You see that our cities: Kharkiv, Mariupol are not as protected as your Edmonton and Vancouver. That Kyiv is under missile strikes. Like Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Ivano-Frankivsk and dozens, dozens of our Ukrainian cities that yesterday were peaceful and quiet. That means more needs to be done. Much more! For peace. We all have to do more to stop Russia. To protect Ukraine and protect Europe from this total evil that is destroying everything: memorials, churches, schools, hospitals, neighborhoods and all our businesses. They have already killed 97 Ukrainian children! We do not ask for much. We ask for justice. We ask for real support that will help us endure and defend our life. Life of the whole world. Canada is already showing the necessary leadership! It is already the first to do what other countries come to later. But we need more leadership, and we ask for more participation from you. Justin! All friends of our country Ukraine! All friends of the truth! You understand how important it is for us to protect our skies from Russian missiles and planes. You can influence this. It seems so to me. You can force even more companies to leave the Russian market. So that there is not a single dollar for the war. If they stay in Russia and sponsor the war, they are not allowed to work in Canada. Let it be so - and it will give us peace. You know, perhaps better than many in the world, that this attack by Russia is an attempt to destroy us, to destroy the Ukrainian people. Nothing else. This is their main goal. This is a war against the people. Against our people. This is a war to destroy everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians. Against our future. Against our character. Against our will. Everything that you, Canadians, know very well, feel very well. So I ask you: do not stop. Do not stop helping Ukraine. Do not stop in leadership and in efforts to bring peace back to our peaceful land. I believe, I know you can handle it. I know that with Canada, our anti-war coalition, which we are reinforcing, will definitely yield the result. I want to address our Ukrainian diaspora, all Ukrainians in Canada. It is at this historic moment that we need your effective help. And you must prove with your steps that you are a part of the history of Ukraine, the living history of Ukraine. Remember this - living. Because we want to live. And we strive for peace. I thank you for your support. I am thankful to everyone present in this hall of parliament. To every citizen of Canada. I'm grateful to you, Justin. Grateful on behalf of the entire Ukrainian nation. I am sure that together - and only together - we will defeat all enemies. Glory to Ukraine! Thank you Canada!"

  "speech": "Free people of a free country! Eight years of war in Donbas, 20 days of full-scale invasion. The third week is about to be over. We all want peace. As soon as possible. We all want to win. And there is always a feeling that a little more, and we will get what belongs to us, Ukraine, by right. But... But efforts are still needed. It takes patience. We still have to fight. And work - everyone in their place. Everyone. In particular, our representatives, our delegation in negotiations with the Russian Federation. It is important. It is difficult, but important, because any war ends in an agreement. Meetings continue. As I am told, the positions in the negotiations sound more realistic. However, time is still needed for the decisions to be in Ukraine's interests. Our heroes, our defenders give us this time. Defending Ukraine everywhere. Wherever the enemy wants to break through. The invaders did not succeed today. Although thousands of their people were thrown into battle. In the north and east, in the south of our state. The enemy lost equipment, hundreds of soldiers... Many Russian conscripts died. Dozens of officers. One more general is among the killed invaders. At least one general today. The invaders also committed new and obvious war crimes. They fired at peaceful cities and civilian infrastructure. The number of missiles that Russia has used against Ukraine already exceeds 900. There are so many air bombs that it is impossible to count them. Two more journalists were killed in an artillery strike by Russian troops. Ukrainian Oleksandra Kuvshynova and Fox News representative Pierre Zakrzewski. Another journalist was heavily wounded. The shelling took place in the Kyiv region. And this is another big reason to tighten Western sanctions against the Russian Federation. Tighten until the Russian state stops the war. Citizens of Russia! Any of you who have access to truthful information could already understand how this war will end for your country. Shame and poverty. Years of isolation. A very cruel repressive system that will treat the citizens of Russia in the same inhumane way as you, invaders, treated Ukrainians. What happens next depends on your actions. I want to speak directly to all the officials of the Russian Federation, to everyone who is related to the current government: if you remain in office, if you do not oppose the war, the international community will deprive you of everything. Everything you have earned over the years. This is already being done. The same goes for the propaganda system. The fourth branch of power in Russia. If you stay to work for propaganda, you are putting yourself at much greater risk than if you just leave. Just quit. The risk of sanctions and an international tribunal for propaganda of an aggressive war, for justifying war crimes. Quit! A few months without a job is definitely better for you than a lifetime of international persecution. Today the Prime Ministers of the three partner states and the three friendly states of Ukraine visited Kyiv. Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. Poland was also represented by Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński and the Prime Minister of Poland. I was glad to meet, to talk directly, in person, in our capital. This is important support. When our Kyiv is a target for the invaders, it is especially important and especially courageous to be here, next to us, next to friends. This is how leadership is shown. And I invite all friends of Ukraine to visit Kyiv. It can be dangerous here. It is true. Because our sky is not yet closed to Russian missiles and planes. The decision to strengthen our arsenal in the air has not yet been made. We have not received planes. But... You know for sure that the eyes of all the people of the world are now focused on our capital, on Ukrainians. So everyone who is with us will receive gratitude. Not only ours, but also of other nations of the world. Everyone who is with us has a chance to become a real hero. I addressed the Canadian Parliament. In fact, in front of the entire political community of this country - our friend. In front of all Canadians. I thanked them for their support - really sincere support. Canada was among the first to come to the rescue of Ukraine. And I called on Canadians to maintain that leadership. Help Ukraine. Not in words, but in deeds: weapons, new sanctions against Russia. As well as an active moral position. A position as regards all international businesses that still stay in Russia, that do not leave. Although they fully understand that they are sponsoring the war, sponsoring terror. My address to the United States Congress is scheduled for Wednesday. An important event. And today I would like to thank President Biden and all the friends of Ukraine in the United States for the new $13.6 billion package of support for our country, our people. The law providing for this funding has been signed. We consider it as the first step towards the full restoration of Ukraine. The Verkhovna Rada also met today. The meeting was effective. Economic innovations have been approved - tax cuts that should save jobs and allow Ukraine's business to work. Wherever possible. There is a zero rate of excise duty and 7% VAT on fuel to stabilize prices and ensure supply. Business regulation is simplified as much as possible. We are reducing the activities of control bodies so that there are no unnecessary inspections for those who work in accordance with Ukrainian law and do not violate consumer rights. The new law also provides the necessary guarantees for the territorial defense warriors - all volunteers will be recognized as combat veterans. A technical decision was made to continue martial law. This is needed to effectively defend the state. Also all nuances of police activity during martial law are settled. I am waiting for the adopted laws to sign them. And I am grateful to the people's deputies of Ukraine for the fact that the majority of votes collected more than 340 votes in favor. This demonstrates the political unity of Ukraine. Finally. When all parties and groups work together in a legitimately elected parliament, one of the main myths of the invaders that the Ukrainian government allegedly does not represent the will of the people is shattered. It definitely does! And all the collaborators who decided to work a little for the invaders must already think where in Rostov they will hide from punishment. I hope that on Wednesday the long-awaited rescue of people from the city of Izyum, Kharkiv region, will take place. The humanitarian corridor has been agreed upon. Over the past 24 hours, 28,893 Ukrainians were rescued from combat areas in Sumy, Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. 20,000 of them managed to leave Mariupol. So far only by personal vehicles. There will be a difficult situation. We are fighting for you. Sorry, everything is very difficult. The Ukrainian humanitarian convoy is still constantly blocked by Russian soldiers on the way to the city. But we will not give up trying to save people, to save the city. And I am grateful to each of our defenders! To every defender of Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Mykolaiv and all other cities this evil wants to capture. I am grateful to all who hold on and fight for life. Your resistance, your resilience, your courage make it possible for Ukraine to survive. And save our people and our land. I signed a decree on awarding state awards to 139 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who distinguished themselves in the defense of our state. 32 of them - posthumously. I also signed a decree on conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine with the Order of the Golden Star to: Colonel Hudz Valeriy Fedorovych. Posthumously.

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! We are stepping up work to bring the invaders to justice. There must be an international tribunal. And it will be. For everything they did against Ukraine. Against our people. For every act of terrorism of Russian troops on the territory of our state. The Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine and law enforcement agencies have already started this work. The launch of the activity of the investigative group of the International Criminal Court in Ukraine is also important, which together with our law enforcement officers is already collecting all the evidence, collecting the facts of war crimes of the invaders on the territory of our state. So that they receive the legal answer - legal and concrete. I spoke with Karim Khan, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. He is already in Ukraine, he has already started working. Therefore, the invaders will be responsible for all war crimes against Ukrainians. Last night, Russian troops continued shelling Ukrainian territory, our peaceful cities, our citizens. Kharkiv and the region... They bombed the coast of the Odesa region. They fired missiles at Kyiv. Hit civilian infrastructure of Zaporizhzhia. As of this morning, 103 children have been killed. Russian troops have now inflicted hundreds of times more damage on Ukraine than on Donbas in eight years of war. And the territories of Donbas, border regions in the Russian direction, Kyiv region and the south of Ukraine suffered the most. The most affected areas are those that Russian propagandists have always spoken of as the place of residence of people especially close to Russia. Apparently, there are no non-nuclear weapons that the invaders have not yet used against our civilians. That's their closeness. That’s their friendship. That’s, as they said in Moscow, \"a divided nation.\" A total of 400 educational institutions have been destroyed in Ukraine to date, the largest number is in the Donetsk region - 119. In Mariupol, the invaders seized a hospital, a regional intensive care hospital. Already damaged by Russian bombs. Patients and doctors are in captivity. Residents of neighboring houses were forced to go inside the hospital as well. More than 400 people are hostages! And the invaders are using the hospital as a firing position to shell the city. This regular crime of the Russian military against Mariupol is no different from Basayev's seizure of the hospital in Budyonnovsk. Although... It is different. Now it's even more treacherous. Last night, the invaders took hostage six people in the Bucha City Council. A Ukrainian rescuer who was captured in an agreed humanitarian corridor is being held hostage! The mayors of several of our cities, activists, a journalist are being held hostage... The Russian state has become an outspoken terrorist. And it is not ashamed. But it will be responsible for everything. The world is already beginning to understand that without the recognition of Russia as a terrorist state, it will be impossible to restore justice for Ukraine, it will be impossible to restore international order. Today I signed an important decree on a nationwide minute of silence to honor the memory of all Ukrainians who died in our patriotic war. All those we lost because of the Russian invasion. Because of the terror committed by the invaders . Every morning at 9 am in the whole territory of our state we will remember the Ukrainians who gave their lives. All who fought. All military and all civilians. Adults and children... Everyone! All those who could still be alive if Russia had not started this war. May the memory of everyone who died for Ukraine live forever! The losses of the invaders continue to grow. The number of killed enemy soldiers is already approaching 14,000. Tens of thousands of Russian servicemen were wounded. They have already lost more than a hundred helicopters. Soon there will be hundreds of lost planes. More than 400 Russian tanks were destroyed, plus several thousand units of other equipment. We take abandoned enemy equipment from the battlefield and use it to protect our state and our people. Ukrainians! If you know where the enemy is and where he abandoned his tanks or other armored vehicles, ordnance, inform the Ukrainian forces. Let's use everything for our victory! And for the sake of victory be wise. Don't publish details of our air defense work when you hear the guys work. Do not publish maps that you find in abandoned Russian vehicles and in the broken command posts of the invaders. Please give them to our military. Let them use it to make the enemy suffer! Today at 3 pm Kyiv time I will address the Congress of the United States of America. This will be an important speech. A speech from all of us, from each of our defenders, from each of our citizens. Addressed to the most powerful democracy in the world. To the state and the people who can do a lot to stop Russian aggression, to restore peace on our land. Eight years ago, on this day, the Russian state organized a fake \"referendum\" on the territory of our Ukrainian Crimea. Which it later used to justify the seizure of our territory. It was illegal. This was the destruction of the entire security architecture in Europe, which was created after World War II. But Russia went for it. If then there had been at least a hint of such resistance, which we are showing now, which you are showing now... If then the world had reacted at least half as it should react now and reacts... I'm sure we would have had neither this invasion, nor eight years of war in Donbas. All this evil was born from the occupation of Crimea. From our weakness, the brutal actions of Russia, for which it should have been punished already in 2014. We are much stronger now, we are united. Now we are a great nation. But... We don't have a time machine and we can't go back to the moment when everything was decided. We can and must fight today, now. We can and must protect our state, our Ukrainian life. We can and must hold negotiations on a just and fair peace for Ukraine. On the real security guarantees that will work. This is an ambitious task. A difficult one. This is a long way. But I am sure that we, Ukrainians, can do all this. We, Ukrainians, can win. And return to peace. To the peace we all so strive for. Glory to our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Mrs. Speaker, Members of Congress, Ladies and Gentlemen, Americans! Friends! I am proud to greet you from Ukraine, from our capital - Kyiv. From a city that is under missile and air strikes by Russian troops. Daily. But it does not give up. And it didn't even think to give up for a single minute! Just as dozens of other cities and communities in our country, which found themselves in the worst war since World War II. I have the honor to greet you on behalf of the Ukrainian people, brave and freedom-loving people. For eight years they have been resisting the aggression of the Russian Federation. They sacrifice the best children - sons and daughters to stop the full-scale Russian invasion. Now the fate of our state is being decided. The fate of our people. It is being decided whether Ukrainians will be free. Whether they will preserve their democracy. Russia has attacked more than just our land and our cities. It went on a brutal offensive against our values. Basic human values. It threw tanks and planes against our freedom. Against our right to live freely in our country, choosing our own future. Against our desire for happiness. Against our national dreams. Just like yours, ordinary people of America. Just like those of everyone in the United States. I remember your Rushmore National Memorial. The faces of your prominent presidents. Those who laid the foundations of America. As it is today. Democracy, independence, freedom and care for everyone. Everyone who works diligently. Who lives honestly. Who respects the law. We in Ukraine want the same for ourselves. All that is a normal part of life for you. Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! In your great history you have pages that will allow you to understand Ukrainians. Understand us now. When it is needed most. Remember Pearl Harbor. Terrible morning of December 7, 1941. When your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember that. Remember September 11th. A terrible day in 2001, when evil tried to turn your cities into a battlefield. When innocent people were attacked. Attacked from the air. In a way no one expected. In a way you could not stop it. Our state experiences this every day! Every night! For three weeks now! Different Ukrainian cities... Odesa and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, Zhytomyr and Lviv, Mariupol and Dnipro. Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death. For thousands of people. Russian troops have already fired nearly a thousand missiles at Ukraine. Countless bombs. They use drones to kill more precisely. This is a terror Europe has not seen for 80 years! And we ask for a response. For the response from the world. For the response to terror. Is this too much of a request? To establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine is to save people. Humanitarian no-fly zone. Conditions under which Russia will no longer be able to terrorize our peaceful cities every day and night. If that's too much, we offer an alternative. You know what defense systems we need. C-300 and other similar systems. You know how much depends on the battlefield on the ability to use aircraft. Powerful, strong aircraft. To protect your people. Your freedom. Your land. Aircraft that can help Ukraine. That can help Europe. And you also know that they are available. But on land. Not in the Ukrainian sky. They do not protect our people. \"I have a dream\" - these words are known to each of you. Today I can say: I have a necessity. The necessity to protect our sky. The necessity for your decision. Your help. And it will mean exactly the same thing. The same thing you feel. When you hear: I have a dream. Ladies and Gentlemen! Friends! Ukraine is grateful to the United States for its overwhelming support. For all that your state and your people have already done for our freedom. For weapons and ammunition, for training and funding, for leadership in the free world, which helps put pressure on the aggressor economically. I am grateful to President Biden for his personal involvement, for his sincere commitment to the defense of Ukraine and democracy around the world. I am grateful to you for the resolution, which recognizes all those who commit crimes against the Ukrainian people as war criminals. However, now, in the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I urge you to do more! New packages of sanctions are needed every week. Until the Russian military machine stops. Restrictions are needed as regards everyone on whom this unjust regime is based. We offer the United States to impose sanctions against all politicians in the Russian Federation who remain in office and do not sever ties with those responsible for the aggression against Ukraine. From State Duma deputies to the last official who lacks the morale to sever ties with state terror. All American companies must leave Russia, their market. Leave this market flooded with our blood. Ladies and Gentlemen. Members of Congress! Take the lead! If you have companies in the constituencies that sponsor the Russian military machine, keeping their business in Russia... You have to put pressure. So that the Russian state does not receive a single dollar, which it spends on the destruction of Ukraine. On the destruction of Europe. All American ports must be closed to Russian goods and ships. Peace is more important than profit. And we must defend this principle throughout the world together. We have already become part of the anti-war coalition. The great anti-war coalition, which unites many states, dozens of states. Those who reacted in a principled manner to President Putin's decision - to Russia's invasion of our state. But we have to move on. We have to create new tools. To respond quickly! And stop the war. The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24. And it would be fair if it ended in a day. In 24 hours. So that evil is punished immediately. Today the world does not have such tools. The wars of the past have prompted our predecessors to create institutions that were supposed to protect us from war. But... They don't work. We see it. You see it. So, we need new ones. New institutions. New alliances. And we offer them. We offer to create an association - U-24. United for peace. A union of responsible states that have the strength and conscience to stop conflicts. Immediately. Provide all necessary assistance in 24 hours. If necessary - weapons. If necessary - sanctions. Humanitarian support. Political support. Funding. Everything necessary to preserve peace quickly. To save lives. In addition, such an association could provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters, man-made disasters. Who fell victim to a humanitarian crisis or epidemic. Remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest thing - to give everyone vaccines. Vaccines against Covid. To save lives. To prevent new strains. The world spent months and years doing things that could have been done much faster. So that there were no human losses. Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! If such an alliance, the U-24, had already been formed, I believe it would have saved thousands of lives. In our country, many other countries that need peace so crucially, that suffered inhuman destruction... I ask you to watch one video now. Video of what Russian troops did on our land. We have to stop this. We must prevent such things. Preventively destroy every aggressor who seeks to conquer another nation. Please watch... And in the end to sum it up. Today it is not enough to be the leader of the nation. Today it takes to be the Leader of the world. Being the Leader of the world means to be the Leader of Peace. Peace in your country does not depend anymore only on you and your people. It depends on those next to you, on those who are strong. Strong does not mean big. Strong is brave and ready to fight for the life of his citizens and citizens of the world. For human rights, for freedom, for the right to live decently and to die when your time comes, not when it is wanted by someone else, by your neighbor. Today the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the Future. That’s why today the American people are helping not just Ukraine, but Europe and the world to keep the planet alive, to keep justice in history. Now I am almost 45 years old. Today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating. I see no sense in life if it cannot stop death. And this is my main mission as the Leader of my people – great Ukrainians. And as the Leader of my nation I am addressing President Biden.   You are the Leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be the Leader of the world. Being the Leader of the world means to be the Leader of Peace. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Wise people of a strong country! We have finally managed to release the mayor of Melitopol from captivity. Our Ukrainian Melitopol, which did not submit and will not submit to the occupiers. Ivan Fedorov is free. I talked to him today. The Russian military abducted him on March 11, trying to persuade him to collaborate. But our man withstood. He did not give up. Just as we all endure. You all. Just as we all do not give up. Because we are Ukrainians. And we always protect our own.  Today a protest action took place in Berdyansk again. Protest against the occupiers from the Russian Federation. Thousands of brave civilians came out against the armed Russian military. And they told them everything, everything they deserve. It is very important. I know it's hard. But it is also important that what they heard from our people, including in Russian, is clear and unambiguous: occupiers, go home. There is still such an opportunity. Every soldier thrown into the territory of our country has such an opportunity. Everyone who has not yet been killed, wounded or taken prisoner. Russian troops suffer such losses in Ukraine, which were inflicted neither in Syria, nor in Chechnya. Neither did the Soviet troops suffer such losses in Afghanistan. If your war, the war against the Ukrainian people, continues, the mothers of Russia will lose more children than in the Afghan and Chechen wars combined. What’s the point of it? Every Russian soldier who lays down weapons will get a chance, a chance to survive. I appeal specifically to the conscripts who were thrown into the furnace of this war. Not your war. And to the rest of the Russian soldiers who still have the instinct of self-preservation. Lay down your weapons. It's better than dying on the battlefield, on our land. Unfortunately, the humanitarian corridors did not work on Wednesday. The Russian military did not stop shelling, did not guarantee security. We are ready to ensure silence. We are ready to take people out and send humanitarian aid. But we can't expose people to shelling on the road. Understand us. Expose to the fact that for the Russian military there is no such war crime, which they would not commit. We are taking away Mariupol residents who managed to escape to Berdyansk... We are taking them to Zaporizhzhia. In total, more than 6,000 Mariupol residents were transported in one day, more than 2,000 of them are children.vThe Russian military tried to disrupt this movement as well. They opened mortar fire on the section of the road between Vasylivka and Kamyanske in the Zaporizhzhia region. Only by a miracle there were no casualties. Five Ukrainians were wounded, including two children. In Chernihiv, the occupiers fired at civilians who were simply standing in line for bread. Imagine. Ten dead people. In Mariupol, in besieged Mariupol, Russian aircraft purposefully dropped a huge bomb on the Drama Theater in the city center. Hundreds of people were hiding from the shelling there... The building was destroyed. The death toll is still unknown. Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people. To our Mariupol. To the Donetsk region... Citizens of Russia! How is your blockade of Mariupol different from the blockade of Leningrad during World War II? Who do you inherit? We will not forget anyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers. We will not forgive any murdered soul. Eternal memory to all victims of this terror! To all the victims of the war unleashed by the Russian state. What else do the occupiers have to do, how many more people do they have to kill in order for Western leaders, NATO leaders to respond positively to Ukraine's request for a no-fly zone or for providing our country with the aircraft we so desperately need? I spoke about this today in a speech to the United States Congress. Ukraine has received strong support from our American friends. And I'm grateful to President Biden for that. I am grateful for the leadership that has united the democratic world. But the war does not end. Russia's war crimes do not stop. The Russian economy is still able to maintain their military machine. That is why new packages of sanctions against Russia are needed. The world must finally officially recognize that Russia has become a terrorist state. And most importantly, Ukraine needs to get more support. Even more than we get now. Air defense systems. Aircraft. Enough lethal weapons and ammunition to stop the Russian occupiers. It was in this speech in Congress that I addressed both the United States and all the relevant states as regards creating a new U-24 union. A new alliance that will ensure that each aggressor receives a coordinated response from the world. Fast and efficient. Immediately. Not in weeks, months, years, but in the first 24 hours after the attack. We can no longer trust the existing institutions. We cannot expect bureaucrats in international organizations to change so quickly. Therefore, we must look for new guarantees. Create new tools. Take those who have courage and do what justice requires. We have already proved that we can do historical things. This is not just our resistance. Not just defense. Even at this time - the biggest test for Ukraine - we managed to join the European energy network. Now Ukraine can use electricity flows from the European Union. We have been moving towards this for decades. It finally happened! I am grateful to all the power engineers of our country, to all those who worked for this result. We are already working on programs to restore our country after the war. I promise everyone, every Ukrainian who has lost home, who has lost an apartment as a result of hostilities or shelling that the state will restore everything. Restore independently. I am confident that we will be able to rebuild our state quickly. Whatever the damage may be... It will be a historic reconstruction. A project that will inspire the world just as our struggle for our freedom. Just as our struggle for our Ukraine. During the day I spoke with friends of Ukraine - President of Turkey Erdoğan and Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau. I thanked them for their support. We agreed on new steps for the sake of peace for our country. In a conversation with the Prime Minister of Ireland, I expressed condolences over the murder by the Russian military of an Irish citizen - journalist Pierre Zakrzewski. I also spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. We agreed on the support for our citizens - temporary displaced persons. I will address the German Parliament on Thursday morning. I will continue to fight for even greater support for Ukraine, for even greater pressure on Russia. For the sake of our common victory, for the sake of peace for us. For the sake of peace for us, the Ukrainian delegation speaks with the Russian delegation. And I want all our citizens, citizens of Ukraine, to hear me now. Negotiations are ongoing. Negotiations for the sake of Ukraine. My priorities in the negotiations are absolutely clear: the end of the war, security guarantees, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear President Göring-Eckardt. Dear Mr. Scholz. Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies, guests, journalists. German people! I am addressing you after three weeks of full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, after eight years of war in the east of my country, in Donbas. I appeal to you when Russia is bombing our cities, destroying everything in Ukraine. Everything - houses, hospitals, schools, churches. Using missiles, air bombs, rocket artillery. Thousands of Ukrainians died in three weeks. The occupiers killed 108 children. In the middle of Europe, in our country, in 2022. I am addressing you after numerous meetings, negotiations, statements and requests. After steps in support, some of which are overdue. After sanctions, which are obviously not enough to stop this war. And after we saw how many ties your companies still have with Russia. With a state that just uses you and some other countries to finance the war. During the three weeks of war for our lives, for our freedom, we became convinced of what we had felt before. And what you probably do not all notice yet. You are like behind the wall again. Not the Berlin Wall. But in the middle of Europe. Between freedom and slavery. And this wall grows stronger with each bomb that falls on our land, on Ukraine. With every decision that is not made for the sake of peace. Not approved by you, although it may help. When did it happen? Dear politicians. Dear German people. Why is this possible? When we told you that Nord Stream was a weapon and a preparation for a great war, we heard in response that it was an economy after all. Economy. Economy. But it was cement for a new wall. When we asked you what Ukraine needs to do to become a member of NATO, to be safe, to receive security guarantees, we heard the answer: such a decision is not on the table yet and will not be in the near future. Just as the chair for us at this table. Just as you are still delaying the issue of Ukraine's accession to the European Union. Frankly, for some it is politics. The truth is that it is stones. Stones for a new wall. When we asked for preventive sanctions, we appealed to Europe, we appealed to many countries. We turned to you. Sanctions for the aggressor to feel that you are a force. We saw delays. We felt resistance. We understood that you want to continue the economy. Economy. Economy. And now the trade routes between you and the country that has once again brought a brutal war to Europe are barbed wire over the wall. Over the new wall that divides Europe. And you don't see what's behind this wall, and it's between us, between people in Europe. And because of this, not everyone is fully aware of what we are going through today. I am addressing you on behalf of Ukrainians, I am addressing you on behalf of Mariupol residents - civilians of a city that Russian troops have blocked and razed to the ground. They just destroy everything there. Everything and everyone who is there. Hundreds of thousands of people are under shelling around the clock. No food, 24 hours a day without water, no electricity, 24 hours a day without communication. For weeks. Russian troops do not distinguish between civilians and military. They don’t care where civilian objects are, everything is considered a target. A theater that was a shelter for hundreds of people and was blown up yesterday, a maternity hospital, a children's hospital, residential areas without any military facilities - they are destroying everything. Round the clock. And they do not let any humanitarian cargo into our blocked city. For five days, Russian troops have not stopped the shelling specifically to prevent the rescue of our people. You can see it all. If you climb over this Wall. If you remember what the Berlin Airlift meant to you. Which could be realized because the sky was safe. You were not killed from the sky as now in our country, when we cannot even make an airlift! When the sky gives only Russian missiles and air bombs. I am addressing you on behalf of older Ukrainians. Many survivors of World War II. Those who escaped during the occupation 80 years ago. Those who survived Babyn Yar. Babyn Yar that President Steinmeier visited last year. On the 80th anniversary of the tragedy. And that was hit by Russian missiles now. It is exactly this place that was hit. And the missile strike killed the family that went to Babyn Yar, to the monument. Killed again, 80 years after. I appeal to you on behalf of everyone who has heard politicians say: \"Never again.\" And who saw that these words are worthless. Because again in Europe they are trying to destroy the whole nation. Destroy everything we live by and live for. I am addressing you on behalf of our military. Those who defend our state, and therefore the values that are often talked about everywhere in Europe, everywhere - and in Germany as well. Freedom and equality. Opportunity to live freely, not to submit to another state, which considers a foreign land its \"living space\". Why are they defending all this without your leadership? Without your strength? Why are overseas states closer to us than you are? Because this is the Wall. The wall that someone doesn't notice and that we are hammering on while fighting to save our people. Ladies and Gentlemen! German people! I am grateful to everyone who supports us. I am grateful to you. Ordinary Germans who sincerely help Ukrainians on your land. To journalists who do their job honestly, showing all the evil that Russia has brought to us. I am grateful to the German businessmen who put morality and humanity above accounting. Above the economy. Economy. Economy. And I am grateful to the politicians who are still trying... Trying to break this Wall. Who choose life between Russian money and the deaths of Ukrainian children. Who support the strengthening of sanctions against Russia that can guarantee peace. Peace to Ukraine. Peace to Europe. Who do not hesitate to disconnect Russia from SWIFT. Who know that an embargo on trade with Russia is needed. On imports of everything that sponsors this war. Who know that Ukraine will be in the European Union. Because Ukraine is already more Europe than many others. I am grateful to everyone who is taller than any wall. And who knows that the stronger one bears more responsibility when it comes to saving people. It is difficult for us to endure without the help of the world, without your help. It is difficult to defend Ukraine, Europe without what you can do. So that you don’t look over your shoulder even after this war. After the destruction of Kharkiv... For the second time in 80 years. After the bombing of Chernihiv, Sumy and Donbas. For the second time in 80 years. After thousands of people tortured and killed. For the second time in 80 years. Otherwise, what is the historical responsibility to the Ukrainian people still not redeemed for what happened 80 years ago? And now - so that a new one does not appear, behind the new Wall, which will again demand redemption. I appeal to you and remind you of what is needed. The things without which Europe will not survive and will not preserve its values. Former actor, President of the United States Ronald Reagan once said in Berlin: Tear down this wall! And I want to tell you now. Chancellor Scholz! Tear down this wall. Give Germany the leadership you deserve. And what your descendants will be proud of. Support us. Support peace. Support every Ukrainian. Stop the war. Help us stop it. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Great people of a great country! The 22nd day of our struggle, our defense against one of the world's largest armies is over. Which we make smaller every day. Every day. But it still has numbers, equipment and reserves. We have information that the Russian military is recruiting mercenaries from other countries, trying to deceive as many young people as possible into military service. We know that this will not help them. So now I warn everyone who will try to join the occupiers on our Ukrainian land. This will be the worst decision of your life. Long life is better than the money you are offered for a short one. Our courageous defenders continue to hold all the key areas that the enemy is pressing. And respond to every attack. To every blow of the occupiers to our peaceful cities, to our people. New Russian conscripts have been taken prisoner. Among them are those who refuse to return to Russia. And there are many who are not even mentioned in Russia. They don't even try to take them back. Their death notifications have been sent to their families although they are in captivity and alive. All Russians who can hear me now, speak about it. Tell it in Russia. Every mother who knows that her son was sent to war against Ukraine must check where her son is. And especially those who cannot contact their children, who have been told that their children had been killed. And who didn't receive the bodies. There are phone numbers on the Internet that you can call and find out what is really happening to your children. We did not plan to take thousands of prisoners. We do not need 13 or any number of thousands of dead Russian soldiers. We do not need it. We didn't want this war. We only want peace. And we want you to love your children more than you fear your authorities. I addressed the parliament of Germany today. One of the most influential countries in the world. In Europe. One of the natural leaders of the European continent. I spoke not just as President, but as a Ukrainian citizen. As a European. As someone who has felt for many years that the German state seems to have fenced itself off us with a wall. Invisible yet solid wall. We have seen Germany fight for the economy for decades. For new Russian gas pipelines and old European dreams. Dreams of some kind of cooperation that Russia has not taken seriously for a long time. We see that the views of the Germans are changing. And this is very important. We see Germany looking for a new path. We see how sincerely the majority of Germans stand in favor of revising the old policy. We see that Chancellor Olaf Scholz has a great chance, a great mission - to give Germany a renewed leadership. Give Europe peace. Long-lasting and most importantly - fair. One that guarantees security to every state in Europe and Ukraine in the first place. And I sincerely wish Chancellor Scholz from all Ukrainians, from all Europeans that Germany and its partners succeed in carrying out this mission. I will continue such speeches in the parliaments and squares of the partner states. Necessarily. As much as it takes to stop the war. To restore our territorial integrity. To return to all of us, Ukrainians and all Europeans, the long-awaited peace. I feel that we are being increasingly understood. In Europe, in the world, in different countries. And it gives us more and more support. The one we have been asking for for so long. I spoke with French President Macron. We are strengthening the defense of Ukraine. We coordinated our joint steps towards peace. I’m grateful for that. I am also grateful to President Biden for his new and effective support for our country. Please, understand: I can't reveal all the details of this support package and others to you. Because this is our tactic. Our defense. When the enemy does not know what to expect from us. Just as they did not know what would await them after February 24. Didn't know what we had for the defense and how we were preparing to face the attack. The occupiers thought they were going to Ukraine, which they had seen before, in 2014-2015. Which they constantly corrupted and which they were not afraid of. But we are different. And this allows us to defend ourselves against a full-scale strike for 22 days already. Everything we have done in a few years. For our defense. For our tactics. For defense tactics, which is not the time to reveal while the war is going on. It is not the time to reveal our tactics of negotiations as well. Negotiations for peace, sovereignty, territorial integrity of our state, our freedom. Working more in silence than on television, radio or Facebook. I think this is right. Today I visited the wonderful Vlasenko family from Vorzel, Kyiv region, at the hospital. Escaping, they got under Russian shelling. The eldest daughter, Katya, who is only 16 years old, covered her brother Ihor, who is 8. The brother got out of the car and cursed the occupiers. Tetiana, mother, received shrapnel wounds. The father carried his daughter in his arms. Thank God they all survived. Because they stayed together, as a family, and defended each other. I was really moved to talk to them. Probably the most during this war. I sincerely wish health and happiness to this family, the Vlasenko family. Like all other families. I wish you peace and work for it. Also today, I awarded five employees of the State Emergency Service with the Order of Courage. Everyone is a hero. Everyone was awarded for selfless actions, for dedication with which they save all of us, save Ukrainians. And some more news, very important and, of course, positive. About our economy. About how we bring our country back to life. Right now, wherever security allows. Wherever business can run. Our government has already prepared a decision to expand the lending program for entrepreneurs on the basis of the program \"5-7-9%\" creating a new opportunity. Any business will be able to get a loan at 0%. For the time of martial law plus 1 month after the war. Then there will be a minimum rate of 5%. And the total loan amount can be up to 60 million hryvnias. So that a wider range of businesses can take advantage of our program. The second news is that the Cabinet of Ministers will vote tomorrow for a large-scale reduction of regulations. There were more than 600 permits and licenses for business, and about 20 remain mandatory. Only those that simply cannot be revoked. For example, radioactive waste management. So, for the vast majority of businesses in Ukraine, the declarative principle will work: you have announced the start of business and you work freely. And the third news, which concerns millions of Ukrainians. This is a special task for the National Bank of Ukraine, for people's deputies and our government officials. I instructed to find such a legislative opportunity for the state to guarantee 100% of deposits in Ukrainian banks. 100%. Not part, as now, as always, but 100%. The whole deposit. In any bank of our state. So that people do not lose money and are not afraid of it under any circumstances. So I'm waiting for specifics. Draft decision. And I hope that the Verkhovna Rada will not delay the support. Because Ukrainians need it. Ukraine needs this. And finally. Our Mariupol, our Kharkiv, our Chernihiv, Kyiv region, Izyum and all our hero cities. Which are in a very difficult situation. Extremely difficult. We are doing everything. All of us. Absolutely. Our army, police, SES, humanitarian convoys, church... All our people. We will not leave you. And we will not forgive them. You will be free. Definitely. I know it. Like all of us on our land. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Strong people of the indomitable country! The 23rd day of our patriotic war continues. After eight years of war in the east. The occupiers do not stop burning their national wealth in the war against Ukraine. I am confident that by attacking us, they will destroy everything that Russian society has achieved over the past 25 years. And they will return to where they once began to rise from, as they say, to the \"the wicked 90's\". But without freedom, without the creative desire of millions of people to work for the development of their state. This will be the price of war against Ukraine for Russia. It will be a fall for them, a painful fall. And they will feel it even in spite of the \"opium for the people\" from television propagandists. Unjust and aggressive war always has a high price for the aggressor. But no matter what happens to them, it cannot comfort us. It will not resurrect our dead people. It will not restore our cities. It will not heal the emotional wound that will stay with us forever. We will rebuild everything - I have no doubt about that. We will become a full member of the EU - each representative of our state works for this 24\/7. But life will be different, and for many - without the thousands of hearts stopped by this war. May the memory of everyone who gave life for Ukraine live forever! Russian troops have continued treacherous shelling of our peaceful cities and our communities. Lviv, Kyiv and the region, Zhytomyr region, Sumy region, Kharkiv and the region, Chernihiv, cities of Donbas - Severodonetsk, Kramatorsk, our Mariupol... Missile strikes, air bombs, \"Grads\". We are shooting down Russian missiles as much as we can. We are destroying their planes and helicopters. And this despite the fact that we do not yet have adequate anti-missile weapons. Advanced weapons. We do not have enough combat aircraft. But we have a goal, pure and fair - to protect our people, our state. Undoubtedly, we will continue to do everything we can. We will remind some Western leaders even louder that this will be a moral defeat for them, it will destroy their prestige if Ukraine does not receive advanced weapons that will really save the lives of thousands of our people. Russian missiles will not fall from shotguns, which some are trying to replace really useful supplies with. Today is a busy day of negotiations for me. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. Charles Michel, President of the European Council. Ukraine's great friend, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson. The subject is clear. First, these are concrete steps that will give Ukraine even more strength, not only directly for the defense, but also for the economy. For our people, for Ukrainians who really defend Europe. Here and now. On our land. President Ursula von der Leyen has promised to do everything possible to speed up Ukraine's accession to the EU. We reduce bureaucratic processes for our state, which usually take years, to weeks, to months. It's not easy, but we do it. I am sure. We also agreed on the EU’s support for Ukrainians who were forced to flee their homes due to the war. For those who are abroad and within our state. We agreed on a new macro-financial aid - another 300 million euros for Ukraine. In addition to those on which a decision has already been made. Secondly, we are discussing the next package of sanctions against Russia. Significant enough. To make them feel that every missile against our state, every bomb, every shot has its price. For the Russian budget, for Russian companies, for Russian ambitions and for specific people who represent the Russian government. And until there is peace for Ukraine, sanctions against Russia must grow steadily. I am grateful to all public initiatives from around the world that offer restrictions for Russia not only at the state level, but also at the level of societies. In particular, I am grateful to the Swedish Port Workers' Union, which promises not to service vessels connected with Russia. This is right. This is a good example for all public structures, all trade unions and business associations to follow. If Russia is not stopped now, if Russia is not punished now, other aggressors in the world will start other wars. In different regions of the world. On different continents. Wherever a state dreams of conquering its neighbors. We need to act now so that all other potential aggressors see that war is only a loss and no benefit. That is why it is necessary for all Europeans to block ports for all Russian ships. So that all Russian commercial vessels follow the Russian warship. It is necessary that all Western companies leave the Russian market and not cover with cheap PR their thirst for profit despite blood, despite war crimes. Like Nestle or Auchan for example. To date, humanitarian corridors in the Sumy, Donetsk and Kharkiv regions have been agreed upon. Sumy, Konotop, Trostyanets, Lebedyn, Krasnopillya, Velyka Pysarivka. It is especially difficult from the besieged Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. The occupiers are doing everything to complicate the movement of people and prevent Ukrainian humanitarian cargo from entering the city. This is outright terror. But we try, we do our best. More than 35,000 people have already been rescued from Mariupol. Rescue work is underway at the site of the bombing by the occupiers of the theater where Mariupol residents hid from shelling, used it as a shelter. It is known that as of now, more than 130 people were rescued. But hundreds of Mariupol residents are still under the debris. Despite the shelling, despite all the difficulties, we will continue rescue work. The situation in the Kharkiv region is very difficult. The occupiers do not stop trying to destroy our city of Izyum. People in Balakliya are being tortured. Our team is doing everything to organize a working humanitarian corridor to these cities and deliver food, water and medicine. I instructed the Cabinet of Ministers, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council and the Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada to develop a format of decisions that will speed up the supply of all necessary goods from abroad. This is especially topical for food, fuel and other goods that meet the basic needs of society. War is not a time for bureaucrats and careerists from different departments to complicate the provision of goods for people. We want to simplify the passage of goods that Ukrainians need now through customs as much as possible. If this requires the removal of taxes and excises during martial law, we are ready to do so. If it is necessary to remove customs officers who do not understand the tasks of wartime to act quickly, we will do so. Our borders must be open to everything Ukrainians need. I am waiting for the appropriate decisions by the end of the day. And then - the support from people's deputies. Because now everyone has to work only for Ukrainians, only for our state, for defense. Not for ambitions. Not for fear. Not for bureaucracy. Everything is for the protection of Ukraine! Today I signed a decree on the awarding of state awards to 138 servicemen of the Armed Forces. In particular, the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the II degree is awarded to: Syrskyi Oleksandr Stanislavovych, Commander of the Land Forces. Since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion, he has been leading the defense of Kyiv. Thanks to his professional and courageous actions, the enemy suffered significant losses and was driven away from the capital. During the defense of Kyiv, more than 30 settlements in the Kyiv region, which were temporarily occupied by the enemy, were liberated. Major Mazurok Taras Leonidovych, commander of the tank battalion. Defending the Donetsk region, he inflicted significant losses on the enemy and significantly stopped his advance. Sergeant Nutsa Ruslana Vasylivna was awarded the Order of Courage of the III degree. Senior combat medic. She personally took part in the evacuation of the wounded from Vodyane, Shyrokyne and Mariupol. Thanks to her actions, 31 of our defenders were saved. She continues to perform tasks in Mariupol. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good evening to everyone. Usually on such days we used to say: “Spring has come”. But now we are saying: “War has come”. But we will definitely defeat everyone no matter what. Because we are free people of a free country. Today, government officials have elaborated the decision to fully reboot the customs service. Cargo for our defense, for our people will be brought into Ukraine as easily as the physics laws allow that. We eliminate the whole bureaucracy, all paperwork, VAT, all customs duties. The goal is clear - to prevent the human factor from hindering the speedy supply of goods, which are really needed now.  Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk and profile committees are working to ensure the support of people’s deputies for the innovations. I emphasize: this decision is necessary for the defense of the state, for ensuring normal life during martial law. I urge certain MPs not to speculate on this issue, as it is for the benefit of our state, not the government or the opposition. We must all work jointly for the sake of our Ukraine, our people. Let’s think about PR after the victory. Another important area of government work is helping Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes due to hostilities. I commissioned the Cabinet of Ministers to develop a comprehensive program to support such people, our citizens. Everyone who was deprived of home because of the war. We already have the outlines of this program. The first component is financial. State support for all displaced persons. Adults and children. Government support for jobs for such people - where they are temporarily staying. So that every person, every family has a basis for life. The second component is housing. The government is preparing concrete proposals for housing for IDPs right now. And also organizes the reconstruction of destroyed housing after the war. The third component is no less important. This is the support for the families who have housed people from areas of hostilities or temporary occupation. At a minimum, they will be reimbursed for the cost of utilities related to the stay of IDPs. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal will soon explain all the details of such a comprehensive program to support our citizens. A coordination headquarters has been set up to regulate all issues related to the delivery of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Under the chairmanship of Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak, a meeting was held with Ukrainian ambassadors to intensify the supply of humanitarian goods to Ukraine, primarily to help internally displaced persons. I also commissioned the government to provide assistance together with the International Committee of the Red Cross to those of our citizens who found themselves abroad after February 24 and need the attention of our state and international organizations. Today there were seven humanitarian corridors in Ukraine. Six - in the Sumy region, one - in the Donetsk region. More than 9,000 people were evacuated from the besieged Mariupol. In total, more than 180,000 Ukrainians have been rescued by the humanitarian corridors. Hundreds of tons of essential products were delivered. But the occupiers continue to block the supply of humanitarian aid to the besieged cities in most areas. This is a totally deliberate tactic. They have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an \"argument\" for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers. This is a war crime. They will be held accountable for this. 100%. Every Russian figure who gives such orders and every Russian soldier who carries out such orders will be identified. And will receive a compulsory one-way ticket to The Hague. To the city where the International Criminal Court is located. People are being rescued from the rubble of the drama theater destroyed by the occupiers in Mariupol, where civilians had been hiding from Russian shelling and bombs. More than 130 people are already on the surface. Some of them are seriously wounded. But at the moment there is no information about the dead. Thanks to the courage and professional training of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the occupation forces were stopped in almost all directions. Heavy fighting in the Kharkiv region - especially heavy near Izyum. Russian troops have already thrown people from training centers there. Absolutely unprepared contingent. People who can't endure half an hour in battle. Kyiv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region, the south of our state - the army stopped the occupiers. The initial plan of the Russian military to seize our state failed. And it seems that they do not know what else can be done to us. It seems that their military commanders are not able to offer their political leadership anything but cruel and erroneous tactics to exhaust us, to exhaust Ukraine. Nothing but constant strikes at the civilian population, peaceful cities, people, children, missiles, air bombs, shelling from \"Grads\", \"Uragans\". Nothing but the destruction of non-military infrastructure - residential buildings, hospitals, schools, churches. But this tactic of their military only worsens the situation for the Russian state. Leads to new and new destructive sanctions. Encourages new members to join our anti-war coalition. It allows us to unite even those states that have always tried to remain neutral to put pressure on Russia. Therefore, negotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine - meaningful, fair and without delay - are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes. We have always insisted on negotiations. We have always offered dialogue, offered solutions for peace. Not only during 23 days of invasion. And I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. It's time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia's losses will be so huge that several generations will not be enough to rebound. Many words were heard in Moscow today in connection with the anniversary of the seizure of Crimea. A big rally took place. And I want to pay attention to one detail. It is reported that a total of about 200,000 people were involved in the rally in the Russian capital. 100,000 on the streets, about 95,000 at the stadium. Approximately the same number of Russian troops were involved in the invasion of Ukraine. Just imagine 14 thousand corpses and tens of thousands of wounded and maimed people at that stadium in Moscow. There are already so many Russian losses as a result of this invasion. This is the price of war. In a little more than three weeks. The war must end. Ukraine's proposals are on the table. In the coming days, I will continue to appeal to the nations of the world to call for peace for Ukraine. My appeal to the Swiss people is ahead, to the people and to the state. Appeals to Israel, Italy and Japan are also planned. The world hears Ukraine's position. The world supports our defenders, defenders of Ukraine. Today I want to express my sincere gratitude to each defender of our strong Mariupol. Our heroic city, which is experiencing the greatest ordeal in its history, in the history of Ukraine. 36th Separate Marine Brigade. 501st Separate Marine Battalion. 1st Separate Marine Battalion. 12th Brigade of the National Guard. And a separate detachment of special purpose \"Azov\". I am grateful to each and every one of our defenders of Mariupol. I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine. Also at the request of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine I decided to confer the title of Hero of Ukraine upon: Colonel Baranyuk Volodymyr Anatoliyovych, Commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade. And Major Prokopenko Denys Hennadiyovych, Commander of a separate detachment of special purpose \"Azov\". For courage, for effective actions to repel enemy attacks, for the defense of the hero city of Mariupol. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President, dear Ignazio! My greetings to all Swiss friends of Ukraine! To all your beautiful people, the people of Switzerland! I am grateful to you for supporting our people. Thank you for defending freedom together with all those who value it. This is very important now. Nowadays. At a special time period. And especially important - from you. When terror became the national idea of one of the largest nations in the world. The basis of their foreign policy. When the crimes of terrorism are committed not by some outcast or group of persons and not by an organization, but by the state. Which has a nuclear arsenal. When a permanent member of the UN Security Council deliberately destroys everything for which the UN was built. Having unleashed a cruel, bloody, senseless war against us. But we now have a chance. A chance to show not only to Russia, but also to any aggressor in the world, any terrorist state, that war will destroy not the victim, but the one who came with it. And, perhaps, this is the last chance for humanity - to stop the wars. Stop the state terror. And I'm telling you now. Switzerland. A state that has a very long history of peace. And an even longer history of influence. In many areas - a decisive influence on the world. Even before I became President, I was thinking what life of our beloved Ukrainians I would like to see. I have often been to your country. And I know very well how you live. And one day, standing near Chillon Castle, I asked my friends - we were one company - why can't we live like this? To have such a standard of living. A high level. And with the same freedom. In such friendly communities. And with such confidence in our own strength. And I sincerely wanted the Ukrainians to live like the Swiss. So that we can jointly decide everything about our own lives. About our land. Not expecting anything from politicians, unnecessary words, but voting in a referendum. So that we can be sure, despite all the financial crises in the world, that our state will withstand and remain a leader. A leader of trust, a leader of stability. A dream for all people. Successful, not very successful - no matter what level, just for all people. So that the Ukrainians, like the Swiss, can feel that they live in real communities that care about what is common to all - for the good of all. Maybe these are all ordinary things to you. For us, these are reforms. And this is the path we are taking and we wanted to take. And we passed the relevant laws. For all this to work. We gave opportunities. Opportunities for our people. So that we gradually reach your standard of living. And we did it until the black day. February 24. The day of the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of our land, Ukraine. And then everything changed. It has changed for each of us, Ukrainians. I'm sure it has changed for all Europeans. And it has changed for all world democracies. It has changed for you, too. I am grateful to you and your state for supporting us in such a difficult time. I am thankful that you did not stay away, didn't say that it wasn't related to you at all. Because, in fact, it is impossible to stay away from the fact that in the 21st century, in the heart of Europe, hundreds of rockets and bombs are flying at peaceful cities. It is impossible to stay away when the army of the world's largest state, albeit only in size, directs all its deadly potential to destroy us, to destroy hospitals, ordinary schools, churches, universities, maternity hospitals, residential areas. It is impossible to be indifferent when children are killed. As of this morning, the Russian army has killed 112 Ukrainian children. And just as I wanted the Ukrainians to live like the Swiss... I also want you to be and become like the Ukrainians. In the fight against evil. So that there is no question about banks. About your banks. Where the money of all those who started this war is kept. It's painful and it's hard. But it is also a struggle against evil. It is necessary to completely freeze all the assets of these people and their accounts. It's a big fight, and you can do it. I want you to become Ukrainians who feel what it is like when whole cities are destroyed, peaceful cities. Destroyed on the orders of those who like to live in communities - different, European, in your communities, in beautiful Swiss communities. Who enjoys real estate in your country. And it would be fair to deprive them of this privilege. To deprive of what they are taking from us. And I want you to be as Ukrainians in the issue of business. Business that works in Russia in spite of everything. Despite this war. Despite all our murdered children. Despite the people killed. Despite the destroyed cities. Like our city of Mariupol, heroic Mariupol, which has been under complete blockade for weeks. Imagine - no food, no water, no electricity. Just under the bombs. \"Good food. Good life.\" This is the slogan of Nestlé. Your company that refuses to leave Russia. Even now - when there are threats from Russia to other European countries. Not only to us. When there is even nuclear blackmail from Russia. And I want all of you, Swiss people, to become like all of us, Ukrainians. I want us not to lose our common chance now. A chance to restore peace, a chance to stop any wars in the world. Because when Switzerland is with you, you are definitely successful. Because when Ukraine is with you, you are definitely strong. Last year we agreed on a big conference with the President of your country. Conference in Lugano. For the sake of economic transformation, for the sake of Ukraine's reforms. It was to take place this July. As well as the next summit of the first ladies and gentlemen. And I believe, I know we can hold them. This year. On your land. For the restoration and development of Ukraine. So that you have the opportunity to show again and again all the best that is in your hearts. In our hearts. In the hearts of all those people who are fighting for freedom and fighting for life. I am grateful to you. I am grateful to Switzerland! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Our strong people of our indomitable country! The 24th day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is over. After eight years of aggression. Ukrainians have proved that they know how to fight more professionally than an army that has been fighting for decades in different regions and under different conditions. We respond with wisdom and courage to the huge number of their equipment and soldiers sent to Ukraine. That is why, for example, the Ukrainian Chornobaivka will go down in war history. This is a place where the Russian military and their commanders have shown themselves completely as they are: incompetent, capable of simply driving their people to slaughter. Six times our military destroyed the occupiers near Chornobaivka. Six times! And they still come there. The besieged Mariupol will go down in history of responsibility for war crimes. The terror the occupiers did to the peaceful city will be remembered for centuries to come. And the more Ukrainians tell the world about it, the more support we find. The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences will be for it. Today I addressed the people of Switzerland. This is a special state. It does not elbow its way on the international stage. But when it speaks its word, it is heard by absolutely everyone. Switzerland has backed European Union sanctions against Russia. This means a lot for the Russian state machine. For people who are used to the fact that power is money. Hence, banks. Hence, Switzerland and other countries that help save capital. I am grateful to the President and to the people of Switzerland and to their country for their sincere support in our struggle for life and liberty. For not staying away. And I urged them to take a few more steps. So that all Swiss companies that have not yet left the Russian market do so immediately in order not to give a single dollar, franc or euro to a Russian military machine to kill our people. So that all those responsible for the war against our state cannot enjoy life in Switzerland, real estate in Switzerland, banks in Switzerland. Our Armed Forces continue to deter the enemy in all major areas. Inflict unprecedented losses on Russian troops. Some units of the occupiers were destroyed by 80-90%. In places of especially fierce battles, the frontline of our defense is simply piled with the corpses of Russian soldiers. And these corpses, these bodies, are not taken away. New units are driven on the offensive through these bodies. Some reserves that the command of the Russian troops collect wherever they can. We are well aware that Russia has just a bottomless human resource and a lot of equipment, missiles and bombs. But I want to ask the citizens of Russia. What have they done to you over the years that you stopped noticing your losses? Do the words “son”, “mother”, “father” mean nothing to you anymore? Already more than 14 thousand of your soldiers have been killed. This is 14 thousand mothers. This is 14 thousand fathers. These are wives, these are children, relatives and friends. And you don't notice it? But there will only be more victims. As long as this war continues. Your war against us, Russia against Ukraine. On our land. Eight humanitarian corridors worked on Saturday. 6623 people were rescued. Due to the shelling of the occupiers, we were unable to rescue people from Borodyanka, Kyiv region. But we will not abandon these attempts. Ukrainians were evacuated from Bervytsya, Bucha, and Bohdanivka to Brovary. People were taken to Bakhmut from Lysychansk, Popasna, Severodonetsk, and Rubizhne in the Luhansk region. More than 4000 Mariupol residents managed to leave for Zaporizhzhia. Unfortunately, it was not possible to deliver the humanitarian cargo to the cities of the Kherson region. Russian troops blocked the movement of our convoy. Why? Their goal has not changed - in the same way they try to portray in their propaganda that Ukraine has left its citizens without the essentials. As if Russia is constantly saving them from something. Although on February 23 our Kherson residents had more than the regions of Russia itself. I spoke today with French President Macron. About our interaction. About finding a solution for peace, for the liberation of our territories. To save our people. I am sure you understand that negotiations are not easy and pleasant. But they are needed. Because it's about life. Ukraine has always sought a peaceful solution. The more we are interested in peace now. Because we count everyone killed. Because every ruined family, every ruined house matters to us. Because we are Ukrainians, and for us a person is priceless. Today I signed a decree on awarding 161 of our defenders with state awards of Ukraine. 40 of them posthumously. And the decree on awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to 12 servicemen. 8 of them posthumously. I also met with warriors of the special unit of the National Police of Ukraine KORD to award them. I thanked them for their service, for the protection of our peaceful cities and for their help to the army. In total, during the days of the full-scale war, 70 of our defenders have already been awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. 2180 Ukrainians were awarded orders and medals for courage, for saving brothers-in-arms and civilians, for effective actions in defense of the state. I am sure I can say on behalf of all our Ukrainian people: we are sincerely grateful to each of you. To each and everyone who defends our state and stops the army of occupiers, which was called one of the few most powerful in the world. Ukrainian poet Lina Kostenko celebrates her birthday on March 19. I sincerely congratulate you. On behalf of all Ukrainians. And let me remind you today her words: [Quotes Lina Kostenko’s poem] In fact, each of us has a nation. And we should not think meanly. Especially those whom Ukrainians have given the right to be politicians. I want to remind all politicians from any camp: wartime shows very well the meanness of personal ambitions of those who try to put their own ambitions, their own party or career above the interests of the state, the interests of the people. Those who hide somewhere in the rear, but pretend to be the only one who cares about defense. Any activity of politicians aimed at splitting or collaborating will not succeed. But it will get a tough response. That is why the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine decided… Given the full-scale war waged by the Russian Federation and the ties of some political structures with this state, any activity of a number of political parties during the martial law is suspended. Namely: \"Opposition Platform - For Life\", \"Shariy Party\", \"Nashi\", \"Opposition Bloc\", \"Left Opposition\", \"Union of Left Forces\", \"State\", \"Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine\", \"Socialist Party of Ukraine”, “Socialists” Party, “Volodymyr Saldo Bloc”. The Ministry of Justice is instructed to immediately take comprehensive measures to ban the activities of these political parties in the prescribed manner. Everyone must now take care of the interests of our state, the interests of Ukraine. Because it's for us. Because it is for the sake of life. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Speaker, members of the Knesset. Dear Prime Minister Bennett, thank you very much for your support. Dear members of the Government of the State of Israel, all attendees, guests, people of Israel! The Ukrainian and Jewish communities have always been and, I am sure, will be very intertwined, very close. They will always live side by side. And they will feel both joy and pain together. That is why I want to remind you of the words of a great woman from Kyiv, whom you know very well. The words of Golda Meir. They are very famous, everyone has heard of them. Apparently, every Jew. Many, many Ukrainians as well. And certainly no less Russians. \"We intend to remain alive. Our neighbors want to see us dead. This is not a question that leaves much room for compromise.\" I don't need to convince you how intertwined our stories are. Stories of Ukrainians and Jews. In the past, and now, in this terrible time. We are in different countries and in completely different conditions. But the threat is the same: for both us and you - the total destruction of the people, state, culture. And even of the names: Ukraine, Israel. I want you to feel it all. I want you to think about this date. About February 24. About the beginning of this invasion. Russia's invasion of Ukraine. February 24 - this day has twice gone down in history. And both times - as a tragedy. A tragedy for Ukrainians, for Jews, for Europe, for the world. On February 24, 1920, the National Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (NSDAP) was founded. A party that took millions of lives. Destroyed entire countries. Tried to kill nations. 102 years later, on February 24, a criminal order was issued to launch a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The invasion, which has claimed thousands of lives, has left millions homeless. Made them exiles. On their land and in neighboring countries. In Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Germany, the Czech Republic, the Baltic States and dozens of different countries. Our people are now scattered around the world. They are looking for security. They are looking for a way to stay in peace. As you once searched. This Russian invasion of Ukraine is not just a military operation, as Moscow claims. This is a large-scale and treacherous war aimed at destroying our people. Destroying our children, our families. Our state. Our cities. Our communities. Our culture. And everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians. Everything that Russian troops are now destroying. Deliberately. In front of the whole world. That is why I have the right to this parallel and to this comparison. Our history and your history. Our war for our survival and World War II. Listen to what the Kremlin says. Just listen! There are even terms that sounded then. And this is a tragedy. When the Nazi party raided Europe and wanted to destroy everything. Destroy everyone. Wanted to conquer the nations. And leave nothing from us, nothing from you. Even the name and the trace. They called it \"the final solution to the Jewish issue\". You remember that. And I'm sure you will never forget! But listen to what is sounding now in Moscow. Hear how these words are said again: \"Final solution\". But already in relation, so to speak, to us, to the \"Ukrainian issue\". It sounded openly. This is a tragedy. Once again, it was said at a meeting in Moscow. It is available on official websites. This was quoted in the state media of Russia. Moscow says so: without the war against us, they would not be able to ensure a \"final solution\" allegedly for their own security. Just like it was said 80 years ago. People of Israel! You saw Russian missiles hit Kyiv, Babyn Yar. You know what kind of land it is. More than 100,000 Holocaust victims are buried there. There are ancient Kyiv cemeteries. There is a Jewish cemetery. Russian missiles hit there. People of Israel! On the first day of this war, Russian projectiles hit our city of Uman. A city visited by tens of thousands of Israelis every year. For a pilgrimage to the tomb of Nachman of Breslov. What will be left of all such places in Ukraine after this terrible war? I am sure that every word of my address echoes with pain in your hearts. Because you feel what I'm talking about. But can you explain why we still turn to the whole world, to many countries for help? We ask you for help... Even for basic visas... What is it? Indifference? Premeditation? Or mediation without choosing a party? I will leave you a choice of answer to this question. And I will note only one thing - indifference kills. Premeditation is often erroneous. And mediation can be between states, not between good and evil. Everyone in Israel knows that your missile defense is the best. It is powerful. Everyone knows that your weapon is strong. Everyone knows you're doing great. You know how to defend your state interests, the interests of your people. And you can definitely help us protect our lives, the lives of Ukrainians, the lives of Ukrainian Jews. One can keep asking why we can't get weapons from you. Or why Israel has not imposed strong sanctions against Russia. Why it doesn’t put pressure on Russian business. But it is up to you, dear brothers and sisters, to choose the answer. And you will have to live with this answer, people of Israel. Ukrainians have made their choice. 80 years ago. They rescued Jews. That is why the Righteous Among the Nations are among us. People of Israel, now you have such a choice. Thank you! Thank you for everything."

  "speech": "Free people of a free country! The 25th day has come to an end since the Russian military has gone to the exercise and found themselves on our land. They all say so when taken captive.  It is already the 25th day since the Russian military has been vainly trying to find imaginary “Nazis” from whom they allegedly wanted to defend our people. Just as they are vainly trying to find Ukrainians who would meet them with flowers. At least in one city of our state. At least in one village. And most importantly - the Russian military cannot find a way home. That is why our soldiers help them with the path to God's judgment. To God's judgment where I am sure they receive only one punishment, one for all: the eternal cellar. Forever under the bombs. Forever without food, water and heat. For everything they did to our people, ordinary Ukrainians. To peaceful people. In Okhtyrka and Kharkiv, in Borodyanka and Chernihiv. In Volnovakha and Mariupol. And many of our other courageous cities. In besieged Mariupol, Russian aircraft dropped a bomb on an art school. People were hiding there. Hiding from shelling, from bombing. There were no military positions. There were about four hundred civilians. Mostly women and children, the elderly. They are under the debris. We do not know how many are alive at the moment. But we know that we will definitely shoot down the pilot who dropped that bomb. As we already did to almost a hundred other similar mass murderers. Today, in the Knesset, I addressed all deputies and government officials. But first of all, I spoke on your behalf, on behalf of all Ukrainians with the people of Israel, who, I am sure, understand us. As free people understand free people. Of course, Israel has its own interests, a strategy to protect its citizens. We understand that. Israeli Prime Minister Bennett is trying to find a way to negotiate with Russia. And we are grateful for that. For every effort. So that sooner or later we start talking to Russia, perhaps in Jerusalem. This is the right place to find peace. If it is possible. Well, Russian propagandists today have a rather difficult task. After all, for the first time in history, the president of a foreign state spoke in the Knesset via video call. And spoke to the people of Israel. The President of Ukraine accused in Moscow of \"Nazism” spoke in the Knesset to the people of Israel. This fact alone confirms how wrong things are in Moscow. During the day on March 20, only 4 humanitarian corridors worked. A total of 7,295 people were evacuated. Almost 4,000 Mariupol residents arrived in Zaporizhzhia in one day. Tomorrow morning we are preparing to send new buses to Mariupol to continue this important mission. More than 3,000 people were rescued in the Kyiv region. But in the Kharkiv region... Russian troops captured our convoy, our humanitarian cargo for the city of Vovchansk. There is no connection now with six people. Five drivers and one doctor. We will release them. We will try again and again to deliver to our people what they need. The Kherson region fought again today. I am grateful to them. Again on the streets. And as always - for all of us, for Ukraine. With national flags. And with our Ukrainian courage. Unarmed against the occupiers. Against shots and military vehicles. This is a feat that inspires us all. This is Ukraine we are proud of. These are Ukrainians to whom I am immensely grateful. Just as all our people are. In the afternoon I spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. A true friend of Ukraine who does not hesitate and does not seek excuses. We agreed on concrete support for our country at next week's G7 and NATO summits. Although we are not members of these organizations, I see that Ukraine has at least one vote there. I also spoke with Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. A star couple who sincerely believe in us, in our victory, in our future. They help Ukrainian IDPs by raising funds. And the two of them have already raised $ 35 million. I thanked them on behalf of our people, on behalf of all of us. Agree, this is a good result for one couple of our friends in America. And we are working to make the whole world our friends. I personally presented state awards to Ukrainian intelligence officers. Please understand - I can't say their names publicly. But believe me, the contribution of these people to our defense is so significant that the orders and the title of Hero of Ukraine for them is the minimum we can give. Just to express gratitude. To them and to all our heroes. Thanks to which we are holding on. And we’re doing it pretty well. And Ukraine lives. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Great people of great Ukraine! In this video, I want to appeal separately to the Ukrainian cities and the brave inhabitants of these cities. To the free south of Ukraine, where the sun shines only to welcome guests, not to random \"tourists\" on tanks. To Berdyansk, Kakhovka, Enerhodar, Melitopol and, of course, Kherson. To Kherson, where today we saw slaves shooting at free people. Slaves of propaganda that replaces their consciousness. Slaves who used to pack everyone in paddy wagons. Even an old woman with a clean white poster. Even a girl with an A4 sheet on which only one word is written - \"peace\". These slaves sent by Russia have never seen so many free people in the squares and streets. They have never seen thousands of people who are not afraid of them, of slaves with weapons in their hands. Slaves perceive freedom as savagery, as danger. They are scared. The fear that propagandists know how to turn into hatred. And then - shots at peaceful free people. Kherson, hold on! We will never forget these shots. Shots from your city. We were all with you in your square and streets. 40 million Ukrainians of our state. Millions and millions of Ukrainians in the world. We've all seen you stand. We’ve seen who you are. We have all felt how you want to regain your freedom. On land, where, watching the Milky Way, the Chumaks went for salt, the enemies felt terrible. And as soon as we can break through to you, every occupier who shot at peaceful Kherson residents just for the blue-yellow color will have a black stripe. And the same awaits the Russian military pale from the fright who were driven out today in Enerhodar. Peaceful Ukrainians drove them out with bare hands. The occupiers in Berdyansk, Melitopol and Kakhovka will have a black stripe. Wherever the occupiers kidnap our people. Those who they think are organizing the resistance. But we are not Russia. Remember. And there is no need to organize resistance here. Resistance for Ukrainians is a feature of the soul. And I really want you, all our Ukrainians in the south, to never think even for a moment that Ukraine does not remember you. Whenever you are in pain, when you resist in spite of everything, please know that our hearts are broken at this time, because we are not with you. And we ask God to support you until we can drive strangers out. This is a feat that you are protesting. This is happiness that we have such people. That we are all Ukraine. During this invasion, heroes have constantly declared themselves among millions of our people. Once - ordinary Ukrainians, and now - fighters. Men and women who stand up for our state. Everywhere: in the south, in the east, in the north, in the center, in the west and abroad. Stand up so that the enemy does not believe that this is a reality. But we will make them believe. And we will make them remember that they are not welcome. And they will never be. In Kyiv, which stands bravely and majestically above the Dnieper. In Kharkiv... Proud, tidy, educated Kharkiv. Which they beat, and it does not obey. Chernihiv. Ancient! Chernihiv, which since the time of the Horde has not faced such atrocities committed by the Russian military now. Sumy, Okhtyrka and Lebedyn... Izyum, Derhachi ... Volnovakha, Popasna... Borodyanka, Hostomel, Makariv... Mykolaiv... Mariupol! Hardworking and honest city! Mariupol. Which the occupiers are simply destroying. Destroying to ashes. But it will survive them all. Worthless slaves who do not know how to take care of their own country. Of their own people. And they go to someone else's. We are fighting for every Ukrainian! And we remember everyone! We are grateful to everyone. Both to the people and to these beautiful cities. As well as to Lviv, as well as to Ivano-Frankivsk, Khmelnytskyi, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Lutsk, our Uzhhorod... Kropyvnytskyi, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih... Vinnytsia, Rivne... Cherkasy, Poltava... Odesa! Those who may be infrequently mentioned in speeches. But who care about our common future. About Ukraine. And about freedom - for each of us. Who shelter people who have been forced to leave their home. Who work for defense. Who send humanitarian goods. Who deploy the evacuated businesses. Who heal, who help. Help all of us, and therefore themselves. Great people of great Ukraine! And I say this not accidentally - great Ukraine. Because I appeal to everyone in our country and to those abroad. In cities and villages. Those who are free and who are temporarily under occupation. In Crimea, in Donetsk, in Luhansk. Where they must also fight for freedom, not sit and wait. I appeal to all Ukrainians. Wherever we are. Do everything to protect our state. To save our people. Fight. Fight and help. Drive these slaves out! Drive the occupiers out! So that Ukraine lives. So that all of us live with it. Free and peaceful. Which we love so much. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Free people of a free country! Our 26th day of full-scale war is over. After 8 years of aggression in the east of our state. The enemy is slowly trying to move. To go on the offensive somewhere. To capture our road somewhere. To cross the river somewhere. The Ukrainian army - well done - repels these attempts. And holds back the occupiers. Today, Russian troops hit the Zhytomyr region with Grads. They got a decent answer. Another enemy aircraft was shot down in the Kharkiv region near Chuhuiv. Our military has already shot down so many Russian planes and helicopters that one can only wonder: what do their pilots have instead of mind? Is it also emptiness? I said “also” not by accident, because they definitely have emptiness instead of heart. Instead of soul. Instead of everything that makes a human human. Borys Romanchenko, a former prisoner of Nazi concentration camps, was killed in Kharkiv. He was 96 years old. Think about it - he went through so much! He survived in Buchenwald, Dora-Mittelbau, Peenemünde and Bergen-Belsen - the death conveyors created by the Nazis. And he was killed by a Russian projectile that hit an ordinary Kharkiv high-rise building... Each passing day of this war makes it increasingly clear what their \"denazification\" is. In Kherson, the occupiers shot at people who peacefully took to the streets without weapons at a rally for their freedom. For our freedom. The Russian soldiers do not even know what it is like to be free. They were driven here, to be honest, as if sentenced. Sentenced to death, sentenced to disgrace. A column of civilians came under fire in the Zaporizhzhia region. There were many children. Four children were hospitalized. Two are in grave condition. During the day 8 humanitarian corridors worked. Kyiv, Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Vorzel, Bucha, Velyka Dymerka, Mariupol, Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Popasna and Kreminna. 8 thousand 57 people were rescued. Thank you to everyone who did it, who worked for the people. We also managed to deliver 200 tons of humanitarian aid. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Rutte and President of France Emanuel Macron. We are coordinating our positions on the eve of important summits in Europe. Meetings of the G7, leaders of NATO and the European Union will take place on March 24. Our position will definitely sound. It will sound, believe me, firmly. I signed a decree on awarding orders and medals to 105 of our warriors. I am grateful to each of them. 7 of them are, unfortunately, awarded posthumously. It was a day of difficult events. Difficult conclusions. But it was another day that brought us all closer to our victory. To peace for our state. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear speakers! Dear Mr. Prime Minister Draghi! Dear ladies and gentlemen, senators and deputies! Dear Italian people! This morning I spoke with His Holiness Pope Francis and he said very important words: “I understand that you want peace. I understand that you have to protect yourself. Both the servicemen and civilians courageously defend the homeland. Everyone is defending the homeland.\" And I replied: \"Our people have become this army.\" They became this army when they saw the trouble the enemy was causing. The devastation it leaves behind. And the huge amount of blood it wants to shed. When I addressed a rally in Florence and dozens of other European cities a little over a week ago, I asked all Italians, all Europeans to remember the number 79. The number of children killed in Ukraine at that time. Now it's 117. 38 children more during these days. This is the price of the delay. Delay with pressure on Russia. So that it ends this brutal war. 117 children, thousands of adults. Thousands wounded. Tens of thousands of destroyed families. Hundreds of thousands of ruined destinies. Millions, already millions of abandoned homes. And it all started with one person. In the occupied areas, murdered families are buried right in the yards of high-rise buildings. In the parks. In mass graves. This is happening today. In 2022. And we know that every next day of the war will take the lives of our children. 117 is not a final number. The Russian invasion will destroy more families and destinies. Unfortunately, the full-scale war continues. Russian missiles, aircraft and artillery do not stop killing. Ukrainian cities are being ruined. Some are almost completely destroyed. Like Mariupol. You heard of it. Our city on the shore of the Sea of Azov. Where about half a million people lived. Just as in your city of Genoa. I was there. And now there is nothing in Mariupol. Only ruins. Imagine completely burned Genoa. After three weeks of total blockade. Bombing, shelling, which did not stop for a moment. Ruined Genoa, from which people are being evacuated, your wonderful people. On foot, by cars, by buses... Just to get to where it is safe. I am addressing you from Kyiv, our capital. From a city that is as important to our region as Rome is to the whole world. The origin of the great culture of a great nation is in Kyiv. And now we are on the verge of survival. Kyiv has gone through brutal wars throughout its history. And it deserves, after all the losses and tragedies, to live in peace. In eternal peace. As Rome and any other city in our world deserves. But, unfortunately, there is an air alarm in Kyiv every day. Bombs and rockets fall every day. Near Kyiv, in neighboring towns and districts, there are several groups of Russian troops. Those who kill and torture, rape and kidnap children, destroy and rob. The occupiers take our property to Russia by trucks. The last one who did something like this in Europe were the Nazis. When they invaded other countries. Russian troops have even mined the sea near our ports. And now it threatens neighboring shores and neighboring countries, because mines can drift by sea to them. Ladies and Gentlemen! Italian people! It’s time to do everything possible to ensure peace! This is a war that Russia has been preparing for a long time. Which one person has been preparing for a long time. One! For decades. Earning crazy money on oil and gas exports and directing them to prepare for war. And not only against Ukraine. Their goal is Europe. Decisive influence on your life, control over your policy, destruction of your values. Not only ours. Democracy, human rights, equality, freedom... The same values as ours. Ukraine is the gateway to Europe for Russian troops. They want to break in. But barbarism must not pass. Ukrainians were one of the first to come to your aid when you needed it during the COVID pandemic. We sent our doctors. Italians were among the first to come to our aid when our people were affected by the terrible floods. You supported us - sincerely, quickly. Without asking for anything in return. You are helping us now - we really appreciate it. But still... The invasion has not stopped in 27 days. Almost a month. So more sanctions are needed, even more pressure, so that Russia is looking not for military reserves or mercenaries somewhere in Libya or Syria, but for peace. So that the same one person is looking for peace. The consequences of this war are already felt in many parts of the world. Not only in Europe. And the worst thing will be famine. Approaching different countries. Ukraine has always been one of the largest exporters of food. But how can we sow under the blows of Russian artillery? How can we sow when the enemy deliberately mines the fields, destroys fuel bases? We do not know what harvest we will have and whether we’ll be able to export. When our ports are blocked and seized. Corn, vegetable oil, wheat and many other products. Vital goods. For your neighbors as well. Across the sea. Prices are already rising. So how many tens of millions of people will need help? In front of your shores... Ladies and Gentlemen! Italian people! You know Ukrainians well. Our people who never wanted to fight. Who are Europeans just like you. You know those who brought war to Ukraine. You know for sure. Those who order to fight. And those who promote it. Almost all of them use Italy. As a place for vacation. So don't be a resort for murderers. Block all their real estate, accounts and yachts - from \"Scheherazade\" to the smallest ones. Block the assets of all those who have influence in Russia. Let them apply their influence for peace. To be able to come back to you someday. Support greater sanctions against Russia. A complete embargo on trade, starting with oil. Support a ban on entering your ports for Russian ships. So that they feel the price for their aggression and for mining the sea. There should be no exceptions to the sanctions regime for any Russian bank. Do not allow the food crisis in your neighboring regions. Help us. Stop the killings. Save Ukrainian families. This war must end as soon as possible. Peace must be restored. Enemy troops must be withdrawn from Ukraine. Demining must be carried out. And reconstruction. Reconstruction of Ukraine after this war. Together with you, together with Italy. Together with Europe. Together - in the European Union. Before the war, I often visited your country. I appreciate your hospitality, sincerity and sometimes loudness. I saw what family and children mean to you. You have wonderful families, you have wonderful children. What life means to you. I want to thank you for helping the Ukrainians who found a shelter from this war in your country. Today, there are more than 70,000 of our people in Italy who, unfortunately, had to hide from the war. More than 25 thousand children. And many of them have received warmth in your Italian families. Including in the families present in this hall. The first Ukrainian was born in Italy, whose mother found refuge on your land. Dozens of Ukrainian children with severe shell shock and injuries are being treated by you. We are grateful to you for that, very grateful! And we are waiting for them to return home. To Ukraine - already peaceful. And you can definitely help us with that. From the first day of this war, you have shared our pain and are helping sincerely - from the heart. Ukrainians will always remember this. Your warmth, your care and your strength that must stop one person. Just one person for millions to survive. Glory to Ukraine! Grazie Italia!"

  "speech": "The hardest part of any speech is the beginning. You all probably know that. In other circumstances, I would have spent a lot of time on it. On the right, most appropriate beginning. But I don't have time. So I'll start with the simple. We have been told for years that Ukraine is not reforming properly. But let's look at the results. The modernized Armed Forces have been holding back the aggression of one of the world's most powerful armies for almost a month already. Logistics chains are functioning. The courts are working. Trains run and transport millions of people. Utilities are doing their job even under shelling and bombing. The test of war is perhaps the most severe. We are successfully reforming even now. And our sustainability turned out to be absolutely real. But sustainability is not an absolute category. It's not about availability, it's about measure. How much is left? Depends on many factors: On our determination - here there are no changes. We are on our land. We defend our values. Our way of life. Our freedom. You can be sure of us. On external support - everything is ambiguous here. We now enjoy serious support. The West has finally become collective. This is evidenced by sanctions against Russia and support for Ukraine - humanitarian, economic, political, military and technical. But is that enough? And for how long will the West keep it? For how long are those states that have sought to maintain economic ties with Russia at all costs, even in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine willing to suffer losses from disruption of these ties? Given the experience of the previous eight years, we cannot be too optimistic here. However, now the risks for the whole world have grown so much that they will simply not be allowed to do business as usual. The next factor is the factor of Russia itself. What is its margin of safety? What are its goals? The West is constantly talking about increasing the price that Russia will have to pay for aggression. But can we imagine the limit beyond which the Russian leadership will say: it is too expensive? It should be understood that the narrative of \"victory at any cost\" is not just a propaganda cliche. Moscow has repeatedly instrumentalized it, beating the stake of those it considered enemies. In the number of victims. In the violation of international law. In resorting to blackmail, including threats of man-made disasters and unconventional weapons. In everything. This must be understood. At the same time, it should be understood that \"small victorious wars\" that do not achieve their goal always increase Russia's risk of a social explosion and coup. Success in war, on the other hand, stabilizes and preserves the regime. Nourishes its desire for further conquests. You may ask, what is the conclusion? And the conclusion is that Ukraine must win the war that Russia has started against us. We must work only for such a result. All of us. What is happening in Ukraine now concerns everyone. Everyone in this room. Every government. Everyone in the world. The war in Ukraine is not just another local conflict. This is a world war that is so far going on in our country. I would like to emphasize once again that Russia's encroachments go far beyond Ukraine. It claims to restore the Soviet sphere of influence in both Europe and Asia. It claims to break the entire system of international relations and discredit all security institutions. Therefore, Kazakhstan, Poland, the Baltic States, Slovakia, Moldova, and Georgia may be next… Yes, Moldova and Georgia again. Georgia, which after Saakashvili is again afraid to say the wrong word to Moscow. Well, apparently, this is such a non-trivial course of Tbilisi's European integration. On the Russian military equipment they write \"To Berlin!\" once again. Do you know what that means? We know. The Israelis know. Believe those who promise to kill you. In the case of Ukraine, the goal of Russia is one - to destroy. To deprive of agency. To stop nation building. According to the program thesis about one nation, which we have been hearing for two decades. Therefore, one may say that this war has no rational basis. It is a war of will, not of necessity. But this is probably the first historiosophical war in history. Therefore, we must assume that the current leadership of Russia will not abandon this goal. And it is ready to pay. The question of whether its entourage is willing to pay can now be omitted. So let's focus on this - the intention to destroy Ukraine. This was not achieved by rapid operation. None of the strategic tasks of the invading force were fulfilled. Therefore, the aggressor is trying to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe, destroy critical civilian infrastructure and industrial potential. We must take into account that the war is taking place on our territory. That our people are dying, that our cities are being destroyed. Our Armed Forces and citizens are holding on with superhuman courage, but we cannot win the war without offensive weapons, without medium-range missiles that can be a means of deterrence (I emphasize: in our case - deterrence, not aggression) threatening Russian territory with comparative destruction. Without a full Lend-Lease, we can only defend ourselves. But it is impossible to defend effectively for a long time without a reliable echelon of air defense systems that shoot down enemy ballistic missiles at a long distance. However, we are not given it. Just as we are not given fighter jets. Just as we are not welcome in NATO. This fear of escalation is understandable. But this fear will not save you. Winston Churchill explained everything: he who chooses shame between shame and war, gets both shame and war. I once produced \"Forebodings\" movie directed by the talented Vyacheslav Kristofovich. So, the protagonist has such a remarkable phrase: \"Everything must happen on time.\" Today I feel the power of this phrase more than ever. Everything must happen on time. Now it is high time. An extraordinary meeting of the Allies is scheduled to take place in Brussels this Thursday, March 24. There is still time to take concrete steps towards Ukraine. Or to say honestly and publicly that there will be no such steps. That NATO is refusing to allow Ukraine to join, not Ukraine is refusing to join, as many have been trying to pretend lately. To say - and together start building a new security system. The Russian leadership understands only the language of power and always confuses peacefulness with weakness. I want to ask our European partners: what are you really like? Are you peaceful or weak? Will you finally give us the weapons that will allow Ukraine to remain an independent sovereign state within internationally recognized borders? Will you finally launch a full-fledged Lend-Lease for us? Or will you continue to watch with concern as our cities turn into ruins? I'll just say simply: close our skies or at least give us long-range air defense systems. Your fear of escalation nurtures aggression. Your determination holds it back. Clearly articulated position \"We will shoot down planes that are instruments of terror. We will destroy the Russian air defense systems that will attack our air police,” is what we need. Tomorrow. Now. Yesterday. Otherwise, Ukraine will bleed out. Become depopulated. We will not surrender, it is already clear to everyone. But let me remind you what I said at the beginning: sustainability is not about availability, but about measure. After the Russian occupation of Crimea and the invasion of Donbas, foreign experts began to talk about the \"Finlandization\" of Ukraine. They meant only one thing: neutral status and \"special\" relations with Russia. But for some reason none of them said that \"Finlandization\" is the preservation of the state, its agency and the freedom of the people at the cost of the forced loss of certain territories as a result of aggression. But we will not give up our sovereignty or territorial integrity. And when we return our territories at the cost of incredible efforts and sacrifices, it will be our victory, but not Russia's defeat. Because without decisive actions of the world community, nothing will prevent the aggressor from continuing to strike at any place of our state. And every such blow to Ukraine will be a blow to international law. The intensification of the refugee crisis in the EU. The collapse of the world security system and the institutions that guarantee it. After all, it is a blow to global food security. In fact, all this is a key sign of a world order crisis. An order where the readiness of the international community to punish acts of aggression, punish genocide remains largely declarative. Profit over justice - was that why the UN was created? Has Europe united around this? If so, none of the existing security systems is suitable for Ukraine. We need a new one. Fair. This system will have to be built from scratch. We are ready. And we paid for it. Paid the highest price - pain, sweat, blood, lives. This fee gives us the moral right to demand: act! Right now! To put it simply, the \"Finlandization\" of Ukraine or any other model of neutralization on Russian terms, which does not involve building a new security system, will only guarantee that these challenges and threats will last forever. So I will ask: European countries, where will your refugees flee to? Ukraine remains Europe's only shield. But what happens if this shield is critically damaged? The half-hearted position of the world community, unfortunately, makes this scenario possible. In this case, reliable guarantees of our security become fundamentally important for us. Multilateral legally binding guarantees. But is there anything as reliable in the West as the NATO umbrella? Sorry, we are not aware of that. And the world needs the same credible assurances that Russia will no longer be able to successfully pursue its military ambitions in the international arena. We demand such guarantees from our partners. Citizens of other states, demand such guarantees from your government officials. Demand now, because tomorrow will be late. Without such guarantees, any of our agreements will be fragile and temporary. And they will hold until the moment when Russia regains its strength and tries to attack again. The timing of this will depend directly on the pace of easing of sanctions pressure on Russia and its ability to circumvent restrictive measures. We therefore call for steady and unwavering strengthening of these sanctions. International businesses should not think about how to bypass them for the sake of profits. They must not become an accomplice in crimes against humanity. Such complicity should not only be a burden on the conscience. We call on foreign governments to prosecute such collaborations. Up to the criminal liability. President Zelenskyy said this very clearly: \"Do not sponsor Russia's military machine. No euro for the occupiers. Close all your ports to them, do not supply goods, give up Russian energy resources, force Russia to leave Ukraine. I believe that peace is possible, but you must act to come to peace.\" Governments are hesitant. But ordinary people have already made a choice. They are convinced that Ukraine has a place in the EU. This is the average opinion of 71% of respondents. 79% of Europeans believe that sanctions against Russia are the right thing to do. 67% of EU citizens believe that Ukraine needs to be provided with weapons. These are the results of a poll published by the French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP). These figures are more than eloquent. So I will tell governments to finally listen to your voters. We call on the international community - not only the collective West, but also China and India - to put aside discord among themselves. The war in Ukraine affects all of you. You are the leaders of this world. Someone will talk about the two poles. I'm talking about two parts of the whole. The Russian issue should not prevent you from reaching an agreement. The interpenetration of economies and integration is a much more powerful guarantee of global peace than the threat of mutual destruction. You can reach an agreement. Russia's aggression against Ukraine may seem to some a good opportunity to fulfill their own ambitions. However, in reality this is a false impression: hopes that the war will be \"localized\" in Ukraine are in vain. Without proper rebuff, Moscow will not stop, and each of its subsequent ventures will inevitably bring the world closer to the hot global conflict. The dramatic events in Ukraine, the heroic struggle of our country for freedom and democracy have shown the whole world: our east and west are together. Now we call on the world to become a little bit like Ukraine. East and West, stand together to protect the planet from those who seek to replace the force of law with the law of force."

In the morning I spoke with His Holiness Pope Francis about the search for peace for Ukraine, for our state, about the atrocities of the occupiers, about the humanitarian corridors to the besieged cities. I thanked His Holiness for a clear and strong position against the war and for his prayers for Ukraine. I invited him to visit our country at this crucial time. I believe that we will be able to organize this important visit, which will unequivocally support each of us, each of the Ukrainians. I addressed both chambers of the Italian parliament today. I felt maximum support. Sincere warmth in words. I called on Italy to strengthen sanctions against Russia and its regime. And strike hard at all Russian figures responsible for this war. For the war against us. Strike at their real estate, accounts and yachts. Strike at their habit to earn money by war and to live and have a rest far away, in Europe, where it is peaceful and cozy. I am sure that new sanctions will be introduced this week. And I am grateful to Italy for supporting Ukraine's membership in the EU. I spoke with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová. About our cooperation and our security. About the development of Ukraine - with all together, in the European Union. An important conversation also took place with the Prime Minister of Canada. We continue to coordinate our positions on the eve of this week's NATO and G7 summits. Justin Trudeau will support us. A special aspect is security guarantees for Ukraine. They are vital not only for us, but also for all neighboring countries. Because of our security, which will cement peace in Eastern Europe. I am grateful to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece who was the first European official to decide to support the work of our humanitarian corridors in Mariupol. To evacuate our people from the city and bring in humanitarian aid, which is crucially important for everyone. As of today, there are about a hundred thousand people in the city. In inhumane conditions. In a complete blockade. No food, no water, no medicine. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing. For more than a week now we have been trying to organize stable humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents. And almost all our attempts, unfortunately, are disrupted by the Russian occupiers. By shelling or deliberate terror. Today, one of the humanitarian columns was simply captured by the occupiers. On the agreed route near Manhush. SES employees and bus drivers were taken prisoner. We are doing everything we can to free our people and unblock the movement of humanitarian aid. That is why I am grateful when a high-level representative of a European state agrees to personally join the humanitarian mission. We expect the implementation of this plan by the Greek Foreign Minister in the coming days. Despite all the difficulties, 7,026 Mariupol residents were rescued today. Tomorrow we will continue this important work. Our representatives are trying to agree on humanitarian corridors in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk regions. Another important news is that an online tool has been created for everyone who can and wants to help with humanitarian goods for Ukraine. In the last two weeks alone, our country has received more than 100,000 tons of humanitarian aid. These cargoes are quickly distributed through special hubs for the regions. But there are even more appeals. Even more opportunities. Even more work. Therefore, to simplify the process as much as possible, the website help.gov.ua was created. On the website you can learn how to buy, how to send and whom to address humanitarian aid. This is for everyone who wants to join. For anyone who can help. In Ukraine and in the world. So that the aid is sent constantly, 24\/7. Our Armed Forces pleased us today. Chornobaivka again - the defeat of the occupiers again. Russian planes were shot down again. Especially important - the bomber was shot down over Mariupol. And so it will be with everyone who kills our people, peaceful people on our peaceful land. I want to repeat once again to all Russian pilots who do not think about the order they fulfill. Killing civilians is a crime. And you will be responsible anyway. Today or tomorrow - this is less important. The main thing is that it is inevitable. We continue to work at various levels to force Russia to peace. To the end of this brutal war. Ukrainian representatives are working on the negotiations, which continue virtually every day. It's very difficult. Sometimes scandalous. But step by step we are moving forward. I am also grateful to all the international mediators who are fighting for Ukraine, for Europe, for the truth. Who bring to Moscow the real picture. Honest. And encourage to look realistically. At what happens in battles. And at the fact that the world will not stop defending the truth. Our truth. Three important summits this week: the G7, NATO and the EU. New sanctions packages, new aid. We will work, we will fight in any way we can. Till the end. Bravely and openly. At all these sites. With full energy. For the result. With all our strength. And we will not get tired. Let's rest when we win. And it definitely will happen. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Hosoda! Dear Mrs. Santō! Mr. Prime Minister Kishida! Distinguished Members of the Japanese Parliament! Dear Japanese people! It is a great honor for me, the President of Ukraine, to address you for the first time in the history of the Japanese Parliament. Our capitals are separated by a distance of 8 thousand 193 kilometers. On average, it's 15 hours on a plane. Depending on the route. But what is the distance between our feelings of freedom? Between our desires to live? Between our aspirations for peace? On February 24, I did not see any distance. Even a millimeter between our capitals. Even a second between our feelings. Because you immediately came to our aid. And I'm grateful to you for that. When Russia destroyed peace for the entire Ukraine, we immediately saw that the world is truly against the war. Truly for freedom. Truly for global security. Truly for the harmonious development of every society. Japan has become the leader of this position in Asia. You immediately started working to stop this brutal war started by the Russian Federation. You immediately started working for peace in Ukraine. Hence, in Europe. And this is really very important. It is important for everyone on Earth. Because without peace for Ukraine, no person in the world will be able to look to the future with confidence. Each of you knows what Chornobyl is. Nuclear power plant in Ukraine, where a powerful explosion occurred in 1986. Radiation release. The consequences of which have been recorded in different parts of the planet. The 30-kilometer zone around the Chornobyl station is still closed. It is hazardous. During the elimination of the consequences of the explosion at the station, thousands of tons of contaminated materials, debris and cars were disposed of in the forests in the closed area. Just in the ground. On February 24, Russian armored vehicles passed through this land. Lifting radioactive dust into the air. The Chornobyl station was captured. By force, by weapon. Imagine a nuclear power plant where a disaster happened. Confinement that closes the destroyed reactor. Operating nuclear waste storage facility. Russia has turned this facility into an arena of war as well. And Russia is using this 30-kilometer territory, this closed zone, to prepare new attacks against our defense forces. It will take years after Russian troops leave Ukraine to investigate the damage they have done to Chornobyl. What sites of radioactive materials disposal were damaged. And how radioactive dust spread on the planet. Ladies and Gentlemen! There are four operating nuclear power plants on our land! These are 15 nuclear units. And they are all under threat. Russian troops have already fired from tanks at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. The fighting has damaged hundreds of plants, many of them particularly dangerous. The shelling threatens gas and oil pipelines. Coal mines. The other day, Russian troops also fired at a chemical plant in the Sumy region of Ukraine. There was a leak of ammonia. We are warned about possible chemical attacks, in particular with the use of sarin. As it was in Syria. And one of the main topics for discussion of world politicians is the question: how to react if Russia also uses nuclear weapons. Any confidence of any person in the world, any country is completely destroyed. Our servicemen have been heroically defending Ukraine for 28 days already. 28 days of full-scale invasion of the largest state in the world. But not the greatest in potential. Not the most influential. And the smallest from a moral point of view. Russia has used more than a thousand missiles against peaceful cities in Ukraine. Countless bombs. Russian troops destroyed dozens of our cities. Some were burned to the ground. In many towns and villages that have come under Russian occupation, our people cannot even bury their murdered relatives, friends and neighbors with dignity. They have to bury them right in the yards of broken houses, near roads, anywhere where it is possible... Thousands were killed, including 121 children. About 9 million Ukrainians were forced to leave their home, their native places, fleeing from Russian troops. Our northern territories, eastern, southern are becoming empty, because people are fleeing from this deadly threat. Russia has even blocked the sea for us. Usual trade routes. Showing some other - potential - aggressors of the world how to put pressure on free nations by blocking sea navigation. Ladies and Gentlemen! Today, it is Ukraine, the partner states and our anti-war coalition that can guarantee that world security will not be completely destroyed. That in the world there will be a foothold for the freedom of nations. For people and for the preservation of diversity in societies. For security of borders. To make sure that we, our children, our grandchildren still have peace. You see that international institutions have not worked. Even the UN and the Security Council... What can they do? They need reform. They need an injection of honesty. To become effective. To really decide and really influence, not just discuss. Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, the world is destabilized. The world is on the verge of many new crises. And who is now sure what tomorrow will be like? Turbulence in world markets is a problem for all countries that depend on imports of raw materials. Environmental and food challenges are unprecedented. And most importantly, it is now being decided whether all the aggressors on the planet - explicit and potential - will be convinced that the war they have waged will lead to a punishment so powerful that they should not start a war. That they should not destroy the world. And it is absolutely logical and correct that the responsible states unite to protect peace. I am grateful to your state for its principled position at such a historic moment. For real help to Ukraine. You were the first in Asia to put real pressure on Russia to restore peace. Who supported the sanctions against Russia. And I urge you to continue to do so. I call for the united efforts of the Asian countries, your partners, to stabilize the situation. So that Russia seeks peace. And stops the tsunami of its brutal invasion of our state, Ukraine. It is necessary to impose an embargo on trade with Russia. It is necessary to withdraw companies from the Russian market so that the money does not go to the Russian army. It is necessary to help our state, our defenders, our soldiers who are holding back Russian troops even more. It is necessary to start thinking about rebuilding Ukraine already now. About the return of life to the cities destroyed by Russia and the territories devastated by it. People need to go back to where they lived. Where they grew up. Where they feel is their home. Their small homeland. I'm sure you understand this feeling. This need. The need to return to your land. We need to develop new security guarantees. So that it is possible to act preventively and strongly every time there is a threat to peace. Is it possible to do this on the basis of existing international structures? After such a war - definitely not. We need to create new tools. New guarantees. Which will work preventively and strongly against any aggression. Which will really help. Japan's leadership can be indispensable in their development. For Ukraine, for the world. I offer it to you. So that the world can feel confident again. Confident about what tomorrow will be like. Confident that tomorrow will come and will be stable and peaceful. For us, for future generations. Ladies and Gentlemen! Japanese people! We can do a lot together with you. Even more than we can imagine. I know what a brilliant history of development you have. How you can build and defend harmony. Follow the principles and value life. Protect the environment. The roots of this are in your culture. Which Ukrainians really love. My words are not unsubstantiated. This is actually true. Back in 2019, literally six months after I became President of Ukraine, my wife Olena took part in a project for children with visual impairments. In the project to create audiobooks. And she voiced Japanese fairy tales. In Ukrainian. Because they are understandable for us, for children. And it was only a drop in the huge sea of our attention, the Ukrainian attention, to your attainment. We have similar values with you despite the huge distance between our countries. A distance that doesn't really exist. Because we have equally warm hearts. Thanks to joint efforts, thanks to even greater pressure on Russia, we will come to peace. And we will be able to rebuild our country. Reform international institutions.  I am sure that Japan will be with us then - just as it is now. In our anti-war coalition. At this crucial time for all of us. Thank you! Arigato gozaimasu! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Japan!"

  "speech": "Ladies and gentlemen senators! Ladies and gentlemen deputies! Councillors of Paris! French people! Thank you for the honor of speaking to you today. I am sure that you are well aware of what is happening in Ukraine. You know why this is happening. And you know who is to blame. Even those who hide their heads in the sand know. And whose hands are still trying to get money from Russia. So today I am addressing you. Honest, brave, rational and freedom-loving. I am addressing you with questions: how to stop the war? How to return peace to our state? Because most of the puzzles that make up the answer are in your hands. On March 9, Russian bombs were dropped on a children's hospital and a maternity hospital in our city of Mariupol. It was a peaceful city in the south of Ukraine. Absolutely peaceful - until Russian troops approached and besieged it, as in the Middle Ages. Until they began to torture people with famine, thirst, kill with fire. There were people in the maternity hospital on which the Russians dropped bombs. There were women in labor. Most of them were saved. Some were seriously injured. One woman had to have her foot amputated, as it was completely shattered. And another woman... She had a shattered pelvis. Her child died before birth. Doctors tried to save the woman. Fought for her life! But she begged the doctors for her death. She begged to leave her, not to help her. Because she didn't know what to live for. They fought. She died. In Ukraine. In Europe. In 2022. When hundreds of millions of people could not even think that it could be so, that the world could be so ruined. I ask you now to honor the memory of thousands of Ukrainian men and women, all those who were killed as a result of Russia's invasion of the territory of our peaceful Ukraine with a moment of silence. After weeks of Russian invasion, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities hit by the occupiers resemble the ruins of Verdun. As in the photos of the First World War, which, I'm sure, each and every one of you saw. The Russian militaries do not care which targets to hit. They destroy everything: residential neighborhoods, hospitals, schools, universities. Warehouses with food and medicine are being burned. They burn everything. They do not take into account concepts such as \"war crime\" and \"binding conventions\". They brought terror to Ukraine, state terror. Each and every one of you is aware of this. All information is available. All the facts are there. About women raped by the Russian military in the temporarily occupied areas. About refugees shot on the roads. About journalists they kill knowing for sure that they are journalists. About old people who survived the Holocaust and are now forced to save themselves from Russian attacks on peaceful cities in bomb shelters. For 80 years, Europe has not seen the things that are happening in Ukraine now. Because of Russia's actions. When there are people so desperate that they beg for death! Like this woman. In 2019, when I became President, there was already a format for negotiations with Russia. It was the Normandy format. The format of negotiations that were to end the war in Donbas. The war in eastern Ukraine, which has been going on for 8 years, unfortunately. Four countries took part in the Normandy format - Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France. Four, but through them the whole world, all positions were represented. Someone supported. Someone was trying to delay the process. Someone wanted to ruin everything. But it seemed important that the world was always present at that Normandy table, the table of peace. And when the negotiations yielded the result, when we managed to free people from captivity, when we were able to agree on some decisions in December 2019, it was like a breath of fresh air. Like a glimmer of hope. Hope that talks with Russia can help. That the Russian leadership can be convinced in words so that Moscow chooses peace. But February 24 came. A day that ruined all those efforts. All of us. Ruined the old meaning of the word \"dialogue\". Ruined the European experience of relations with Russia. Ruined decades of European history. All this was bombed by Russian troops. Destroyed by Russian artillery. Burned after Russian missile strikes. The truth was not found in the offices. So now we have to look for it and gain it on the battlefield. So what now? What do we have left? Our values. Unity. And the determination to defend our freedom. Common freedom! One for Paris and Kyiv. For Berlin and Warsaw. For Madrid and Rome. For Brussels and Bratislava. Sips of fresh air will definitely not help anymore. It makes sense to act together. To put pressure together. To force Russia to seek peace. Ladies and Gentlemen! French people! On February 24, the Ukrainian people united. Today we have no right or left. We do not look at who is in power and who is in opposition. The usual policy ended on the day of Russia's invasion and will resume only when there is peace. And this is right - to fight for life. To protect our state. We are grateful to you, we are grateful that France helps. We are grateful for the efforts of President Macron. Who showed true leadership. We are constantly communicating with him, it is true, we are coordinating some of our steps. Ukrainians see that France values freedom as much as it has always been. And you protect it. You remember what it is. Freedom, equality, brotherhood. Each of these words is full of power for you! I feel it. Ukrainians feel it. That is why we expect from you, we expect from France, from your leadership, that you will be able to make Russia seek peace. To make it end this war against freedom. Against equality. Against brotherhood. Against everything that made Europe united and full of free diverse life. We expect from France, from your leadership, that Ukraine's territorial integrity will be restored. And together we can do it. If among the attendees there are those who doubt it, your people are already sure. Like other nations of Europe. And that during France's presidency in the European Union the long overdue historical decision will be made - on Ukraine's full membership in Europe and the EU. Historical decision in historical time. As has always been the case in the history of the French people. Ladies and Gentlemen! French people! Tomorrow will be a month since Ukrainians have been fighting for their own lives, for their own freedom, since our army has been heroically opposing the overwhelming forces of Russia. We need more help! We need more support! In order for freedom not to lose, it must be well-armed. Tanks and anti-tank weapons, aviation and air defense. We need all this! You can help us. I know. You can! In order for freedom not to lose, the world must support it with sanctions against the aggressor. A new sanctions package every week. Every week! French companies must leave the Russian market. Renault, Auchan, Leroy Merlin and others. They must cease to be sponsors of Russia's military machine, sponsors of the killing of children and women, sponsors of rape, robbery and looting by the Russian army. All companies must remember once and for all that values are worth more than profit. Especially profit on blood. And we must already think about the future. About how we will live after this war. Guarantees are needed. Strong guarantees. Guarantees that security will be unshakable, that there will be no war, and that war in general will be impossible. We are creating such a system of guarantees. A new security system. In which France, I believe, will play a leading role. So that no one will ever have to beg for death again! So that people live their life. Full life. And so that we say goodbye to people not under bombs, not in war, but when the time comes. Only in peace. Only in dignity. Because you have to live so that you are respected. So that you are remembered. And so that people say goodbye to you in a way France said goodbye to the great Belmondo. Thank you, France! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Free people of the free world! Ukrainians and citizens of all countries who value freedom! Friends! On March 24 it will be the month of our resistance. Heroic resistance of the Ukrainian state, the Ukrainian people to the ruthless invasion of Russia. It's already a month of our defense against the attempt to destroy us. Wipe off the face of the earth. The original plan of the Russian troops failed already in the first days of the invasion. They thought Ukrainians would be frightened. They thought Ukrainians would not fight. They were wrong. They know nothing about us, about Ukrainians. They know nothing at all about freedom. About how valuable it is. They do not know how freedom enriches life. Gives meaning to life. But there are many of them! There are still many invaders. Russia is getting manpower from everywhere. Equipment. Air bombs, missiles. Looking for mercenaries around the world. Any scum capable of shooting at civilians. Russian troops destroy our cities. Kill civilians indiscriminately. Rape women. Abduct children. Shoot at refugees. Capture humanitarian convoys. They are engaged in looting. They burn museums, blow up schools and hospitals. The target for them is universities, residential neighborhoods... Anything! Russian troops do not know the limits of evil. But...The war of Russia is not only the war against Ukraine. Its meaning is much wider. Russia started the war against freedom as it is. This is only the beginning for Russia on the Ukrainian land. Russia is trying to defeat the freedom of all people in Europe. Of all the people in the world. It tries to show that only crude and cruel force matters. It tries to show that people do not matter, as well as everything else that makes us people. That’s the reason we all must stop Russia. The world must stop the war. I thank everyone who acts in support of Ukraine. In support of freedom. But the war continues. The acts of terror against peaceful people go on. One month already! That long! It breaks my heart, hearts of all Ukrainians and every free person on the planet. That’s why I ask you to stand against the war! Starting from March 24 – exactly one month after the Russian invasion… From this day and after then. Show your standing! Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities. Come in the name of peace. Come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.  Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard. Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters. Ukraine matters. From March 24. In downtowns of your cities. All as one together who want to stop the war. I want to address the citizens of Russia separately. I am sure that there are many of you who are disgusted by the policy of your state. Who are already just sick of what you see on TV. Of the lies of your propagandists on the Internet. Propagandists who are paid by your taxes. And they lie about the war, which is paid for by your taxes. And which makes all the citizens of Russia poorer. Poorer every day. Isn't that stupid? Your state collects taxes from you to make you poorer. To isolate you from the world. To make it easier for them to control you. And easier to send you to the war to die. Ukraine has never threatened the security of Russia. Even now, we are doing everything just to bring peace back to our land. Not to yours - to our land. To our people. We are doing everything to end this war. And when we succeed - it will certainly happen - you will be sure of at least one thing: your children will no longer be sent to die on our land, on our territory. Therefore, you, the citizens of Russia, are also interested in peace. Save your sons from the war. Tell the truth about the war. And if you can leave Russia so as not to give your taxes to the war, do it. All polls show that the people of Europe and America support us. I am grateful to all of you for that. Grateful on behalf of Ukraine. To everyone in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Britain and other countries for supporting us. For supporting freedom. For supporting Ukraine. On March 24, three important summits will take place in Brussels, Europe. Important for the security of each of us. NATO Summit. EU Summit. G7 Summit. I'm sure people will show how they support us. But politicians must also support freedom. All of them. They must support the struggle for life. We are waiting for meaningful steps. From NATO, the EU and the G7. We know that the Russians have already begun to lobby their interests. These are the interests of war. We know that they are working with some partners. We know that they want to put this issue out. The struggle against war. But this is the war that needs to be put out.  Our firm position will be represented at these three summits. At these three summits we will see: Who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money. Life can be defended only when united. Freedom must be armed. Ukrainian sky has not been made safe from Russian missiles and bombs. We have not received aircraft and modern anti-missile weapons. We have not received tanks, anti-ship equipment. Russian forces can keep killing thousands of our citizens, destroying our cities. Just because there are too many invaders. Just because Russia has been preparing for such a war for decades. We asked to close our sky. And we asked for assistance from NATO to be effective and without limits. Any support in weapons that we need. We asked the Alliance to say it will fully help Ukraine win this war, clear our territories of the invaders and restore peace in Ukraine. Free people of the free world! Together we must prevent Russia from breaking someone in NATO, EU or G7. From breaking and taking it to the war side. We will see on March 24. Ukrainians! All our heroes! A month has passed. We withstood six times longer than the enemy had planned, than the Russian command had reported to the Russian president. They were convinced that Ukraine is not a state. They were convinced that Ukrainians are not a nation. They deceived themselves. But we don't care about them. This is their state suicide. And we are just protecting our lives. Our freedom. Our own state. Our children. Hence, our future. This is a war for independence. And we must win. We will rebuild every city that heroically resists. We will bring the invaders to justice for every crime. Zhytomyr and Sumy, Kyiv and Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, Volnovakha and Mykolaiv, Okhtyrka and Hostomel, Kherson and Odesa, Izyum and Donetsk, Luhansk and Chornobaivka... All our people will live! In a free Ukraine. After our victory. Which will come sooner, the more we will all be united. We are all Ukrainians. We are all Europeans. We are all free people of the free world. In unity! On the battlefield and in political positions, at rallies and summits, at work and in communication with people. By all our actions, we must force Russia to seek peace. By all our actions, we must bring the victory of freedom closer. May the memory of all who died for Ukraine live forever! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear attendees! I am addressing you from Kyiv, our capital, which has been fighting for a month already, just as our entire state. Yes, it is true - we are not in the Alliance. Not in the most powerful defense union in the world. Not one of the 30 states under the umbrella of joint protection. Under the umbrella of Article 5. It feels like we are in the \"gray zone\". Between the West and Russia. But we defend all our common values. And we are bright people! And we have been defending all these values for a month now! A month of heroic resistance. A month of the darkest suffering. A month of unpunished destruction of the peaceful state, and with it - the whole architecture of global security. All this is before the eyes of the whole world. Over the decades, Russia has accumulated considerable resources, military resources, manpower and equipment, air bombs, missiles. They invested crazy money in death while the world invested in life. But Ukraine is holding on bravely! At the cost of thousands of lives. At the cost of destroyed cities. At the cost of almost ten million migrants. Three and a half of them are already in your territories, in the territories of NATO countries. I am grateful for the support of these people. And people, unfortunately, continue to leave their homes. They are fleeing the terror that the occupiers brought with them. The very first hours of the invasion meant brutal missile strikes for us. During the month of the war, Russia fired more than a thousand different missiles at our cities. Made hundreds of air raids. On February 24, I addressed you with a perfectly clear, logical request to help close our skies. In any format. Protect our people from Russian bombs and missiles. We did not hear a clear answer. Ukraine does not have powerful anti-missile weapons, and has a much smaller aircraft fleet than Russia. Therefore, their advantage in the sky is like the use of weapons of mass destruction. And you see the consequences today - how many people were killed, how many peaceful cities were destroyed. The Ukrainian army has been resisting for a month in unequal conditions! And I have been repeating the same thing for a month now. To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance - without restrictions. As Russia uses without restrictions its entire arsenal against us. Destroys all living things. Any objects - from houses to churches, from food warehouses to universities, from bridges to hospitals. Ukraine asked for your planes. So that we do not lose so many people. And you have thousands of fighter jets! But we haven't been given any yet. We asked for tanks. So that we can unblock our cities that are now dying - Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol, others. Cities where Russia is keeping hundreds of thousands of people hostage and artificially creating famine - no water, no food, nothing there. You have at least 20,000 tanks! Ukraine asked for a percent, one percent of all your tanks to be given or sold to us! But we do not have a clear answer yet... The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help. Ukraine never wanted this war. And does not want to fight for years. We just want to save our people. We want to survive! Just survive! Like any nation, we have the right to it. The right to life. The right to this one percent. And I do not blame NATO - I want to be clear. You are not guilty. It's not your missiles, it's not your bombs that are destroying our cities. This morning, by the way, there were phosphorus bombs. Phosphorus Russian bombs. Adults were killed again and children were killed again. I just want you to know that the Alliance can still prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian strikes, from Russian occupation, by providing us with all the weapons we need. Yes, we are not in the Alliance. And I do not make these claims. But Ukrainians never thought that the Alliance and the Allies were different. That in matters of life and death you can be a force separately, but together - no. That NATO may be afraid of Russia's actions. I am sure you already understand that Russia does not intend to stop in Ukraine. Does not intend and will not. It wants to go further. Against the eastern members of NATO. The Baltic states, Poland - that's for sure. Will NATO then stop thinking about it, worrying about how Russia will react? Who can be sure of that? And do you have confidence that Article 5 can work? \"Budapest\" hasn’t worked for us already. Our Budapest Memorandum. Has not worked for peace in Ukraine. And I will tell you honestly - today Budapest is not working for peace in Ukraine as well. Yes, we receive help from individual members of the Alliance. I am very grateful. Ukrainians are sincerely grateful for this. To each of you who gives what you have, supporting us. But what about the Alliance? The question of Article 5 is fundamental. I just want you to know what we think about it. And I sincerely wish you that we are wrong in our assessments and in our doubts. I sincerely wish that you actually have a very strong Alliance. Because if we are wrong, the world is safe. But if we are at least one percent right, I ask you to reconsider your attitude. Your own estimates. And really take care of security, security in Europe and, consequently, in the world. You can give us one percent of all your aircraft. One percent of all your tanks. One percent! We can't just buy it. Such a supply directly depends only on NATO's decisions, on political decisions, by the way. MLRS systems. Anti-ship weapons. Means of air defense. Is it possible to survive such a war without it? So when it's finally available, it will give us and you as well, one hundred percent security. And we need one. And the only thing I demand from you… After such a month of war. This is a request for the sake of our military. After such a war against Russia ... Never, please, never tell us again that our army does not meet NATO standards. We have shown what our standards are capable of. And how much we can give to the common security in Europe and the world. How much we can do to protect against aggression against everything we value, everything you value. But NATO has yet to show what the Alliance can do to save people. To show that this is truly the most powerful defense union in the world. And the world is waiting. And Ukraine is very much waiting. Waiting for real actions. Real security guarantees. From those whose word is trustworthy. And whose actions can keep the peace. Truly. All offers are on the table. Our needs are on the table. We need peace immediately. The answers are up to you. I am thankful to those who help us! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Greetings, Mr. Speaker! It is a great honor and opportunity to address you today. Greetings also to the Prime Minister! To the Swedish Riksdag MPs and members of the Government! Swedish people! Now the blue and yellow flag in the world is probably the most popular. These colors are associated with freedom. This is true for different people on different continents. And of course in Europe. The blue and yellow colors of the national flag are not just about Ukraine. This is about you as well, about Sweden. And obviously this is not a coincidence. This is fate. Because we are equally for freedom. We are equally for a peaceful life. We are equally for respect for everyone. We are equally for justice and equally for caring for the natural world in which we live. Therefore, it is logical that Sweden is now among those who support Ukraine the most. And I am sincerely grateful to each of you for this. Today is exactly the month of the worst ordeal - the full-scale war waged by Russia against our state. Europe has never known such a dark month since World War II. It has not seen such destruction and such war crimes. The list of those killed already reaches thousands. Dozens of our cities and communities were destroyed. Russian troops do not distinguish between civilian and military targets. They destroy everything. They burn residential neighborhoods and houses. They blow up hospitals. They even fire at kindergartens with rocket artillery! Hundreds of educational facilities and more than 200 schools were destroyed. Russian troops bombed universities. Imagine - they destroy any infrastructure that simply serves life. Warehouses with food and medicine. They seized two nuclear power plants. Yesterday they hit the second chemical production already. Phosphorus bombs were used today! Both adults and children were killed. What is the purpose of such actions of Russia? What is the reason of such terror against us? This is an attempt to conquer the whole nation. An attempt to make the neighboring state a slave. Ladies and Gentlemen! Swedish people! Modern Europe, which has finally become peaceful, is built on clear principles. Namely: there can be no forced border revision. And every nation has the right to choose its own future - without dictatorship, without coercion, without occupation. Thanks to these two principles, we in Europe have had an unprecedented era of cooperation. Peace. Confidence. We had it until the Russian leadership decided that it could travel in time. That it allegedly could cancel the 21st century. Allegedly could act as in the old days of totalitarian ideologies. If Ukraine failed to endure, defend itself, it would mean that everything we, living and modern people, value was lost. Everything you value. Everything that is valued by any free people of any state. This would mean that all of Russia's neighbors are in danger. This would mean that you are in danger, because only the sea separates you from this aggressive policy of this state. And Russian propagandists are already discussing on state television how Russia is occupying your Gotland island in particular. And how to keep it under control for decades. They show it to the Russians on the map, show the directions of the offensive... You may ask for what purpose? They say it will be beneficial for Russia to deploy air defense systems and a military base in Gotland. To cover the capture of the Baltic states. Russia went to war against Ukraine because it expects to go further to Europe. Expects to destroy freedom further in Europe. This is a fundamental challenge for the European security system. Please take a look at what the Russian military has already done in our country. 8 years of war in the east. Occupation of Crimea. This is repression. Torture of people, suppression of all manifestations of freedom and diversity. A month of full-scale war. Total cruelty. The bombing of peaceful cities is as terrible as it was in Syria. Abduction of children. Forced transportation of children and adults to Russia. Rape in the occupied areas. Large-scale looting by the Russian military. Now tens of thousands of houses and tens of thousands of apartments have been destroyed. And there are already almost ten million migrants, three and a half million of them in the European Union. I deliberately do not want to call these Ukrainians refugees. Because I know that they will return to Ukraine. As soon as Russia leaves our land, as soon as peace is established. Ladies and Gentlemen! Swedish people! Sweden was one of the first to come to our aid. I am grateful to you! Your support is absolutely sincere. It is based on values. On our love for freedom. On what our blue-yellow national colors symbolize. The whole world knows what Sweden wants. The whole world has seen in a month of this shameful war what Ukraine wants. We are together in our anti-war coalition. And we must do everything to make Russia seek peace. Sweden has made a historic decision to provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons. We thank you for that! For your prudence. For your foresight. Sweden supports the sanctions policy. A policy without which there will be no peace. Because the Russian leadership will not understand any language other than effective sanctions. But for peace to come faster, sanctions packages against Russia must be applied on a weekly basis. Not a single barrel of Russian oil! No Russian ships at your ports! Not a single euro of taxes of your companies in Russia! Their military machine must be left without means of subsistence. Deliberate actions of Russian troops to destroy civilians in Ukraine, to destroy our peaceful cities must receive an inevitable and principled response from all European countries. From the free world. This has already become the typical feature of Russian troops... Syria, Ukraine... Massacres. Cities destroyed to the ground. Phosphorus and other prohibited munitions. To prevent this from becoming a victorious strategy, all war crimes must be punished. Those who gave the order to kill and those who killed must face the Tribunal. So that no other country in the world thinks that it can kill people with impunity just like that, that it can destroy neighboring countries. I am confident that together we will be able to ensure peace, and that is why we must now think about rebuilding Ukraine after this war. And it will happen! I invite Swedish architects, Swedish companies, the Swedish state, your people to take part in this historic project. Ukraine was beautiful. But now it will be great, because this is our nation. Great Ukraine. Great recovery project. For the sake of the people. For the development of our country and the whole of Europe. I invite you to show to the world, to all present and future generations that war does not bring the result. And peace does. And it gives life. Sweden is the first country we offer this project to. You can take patronage over any city, region or industry to restore them. I am confident that your leadership will be indispensable. Your technology, business and your love of life. Your ability to organize space in people's best interest. Ukraine - all our heroic defenders, all our citizens - has already done a lot to protect our common European values, our common European home. We are fighting not only for Ukraine, but also for the security of the European Union! And we have proved that we deserve to be a full member of the European Union. The decision is already being elaborated. It's time to adopt it! I believe that you will support us in this as well. Thank you, thank you Sweden! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! The world's greatest democracies represented by you! First of all, I would like to thank Chancellor Scholz and the German presidency for the opportunity to address you today. At this urgent summit. Today is exactly one month since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Russia, which was present at this format together with advanced democracies. Then the G7 was the G8. And there were a lot of hopes for its participation, for a dialogue with Russia. I want to emphasize that most of those hopes, as well as the place next to the Group of Seven, Russia received in advance. And it still hasn't deserved this advance. But this and other similar advances gave the Russian leadership the impression that they would get away with anything. In recent years, the Russian state has created so many crises and such instability that it has now become a major problem for the world. A problem that is only growing. And you and I still have no idea how many more such urgent summits will have to be held before the problems created by Russia are resolved. Europe is going through a war, every day of which is full of war crimes of Russian troops. This morning I received information that Russian troops had used phosphorus bombs against civilians in Ukraine. The threat of large-scale use of chemical weapons by Russia on the territory of Ukraine is quite real. We are trying to find out the exact number of deported Ukrainians. People who are forcibly deported to Russia on a daily basis are deprived of documents, means of communication - everything is taken away - and distributed among their regions. And even then Russia tries to mobilize them into its army! It illegally abducts children. According to our data, more than two thousand already! Ukrainian cities - Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Okhtyrka and other cities - look like a global catastrophe. They are ruined. The roads from these cities, which people used to escape, resemble the set of a post-apocalyptic movie with hundreds of burned and shot cars. But it is true: there is a global catastrophe! Russia has destroyed the global security architecture and dealt a powerful blow to international relations. But this is just the beginning. This war may be followed by a global food crisis. The longer there is no peace on Ukrainian land, the less food the world market will receive from Ukraine. Consequently, many countries in Asia, Africa, and even Europe, may have extraordinary problems with access to basic products, with food prices. This will definitely result in political destabilization. Maybe this is also the goal of the Russian leadership? I do not know. We must all act immediately! Immediately stop Russian troops, remove them from the territory of Ukraine. Peace is needed immediately before the world faces an even greater level of problems. It is better now to tighten sanctions against Russia as much as necessary to stop its military machine than to deal with the consequences of the food and political security global crisis. Unprecedented challenges! If so, a full embargo on trade with Russia is needed. It is necessary to deprive Russia of the opportunity to use GPS in war. It is very important. So that this system does not help Russian missiles and bombs destroy peaceful cities. Russian banks and, most importantly, the Central Bank of Russia must get a complete blockade from the global financial system. War criminals should be left without money at all! And their frozen assets should turn, inter alia, into reparations for the reconstruction of Ukraine. It is better to give Ukraine the kind of weaponry support we really need now than to look for weapons for other countries later. We mean Georgia, Moldova, the Baltic States, Poland and Central Asia. The sooner this happens as we ask, the sooner there will be peace in Eastern Europe. This is in our best interest. This is in your best interest. This is in the interests of all democracies. Because democracies must be able to defend themselves. Freedom must be armed. Life must overcome death. And I emphasize this: no advances to such a Russian state! Never again. Any steps towards it or towards any other violator of international law should take place only after their steps towards peace, towards universally recognized rules. And on the basis of a system of preventive deterrence. I am grateful to you for the unprecedented unity. For your resolute support for peace for our country, for our people. I am grateful to those of you who are trying one hundred percent to stop this war. I believe we can do it. We will be able to make your Group of Seven not just the Great Seven, but the Great Seven of Peacekeepers. What do we need for this? Ukraine is very specific in answering this question. First - to intensify sanctions against Russian aggression on a weekly basis until it stops and restores peace for us. Second - to take part in the creation of a new system of security guarantees for Ukraine, for our region. Real guarantees. Effective. Those that can stop any aggressor in 24 hours. We offered to create an association - U-24. This is what the world really needs. Not just to preventively stop the war or hostilities that have already begun. But also to provide assistance to the states that were affected by the natural disaster, that need to be supported during a pandemic, that are facing migration or food crises. The world needs new effective alliances! New effective guarantees! This can support developing democracies. This can support the economies of countries where there are no stable institutions yet. And third - which directly concerns our state and Eastern Europe. We must rebuild our state together as soon as possible after the war. Rebuild cities. Restore economic life. Bring people back. I offer you to participate in such a project. Recovery project. I am sure it will be in our common interest. But first - weapons for Ukraine. First - increase sanctions against Russia every week. That is, peace comes first. We have the strength to do it. You have the strength to do it. So, may there be peace! I am grateful to everyone who supports us. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Greetings to all of you, greetings to all our friends, friends of Ukraine! Greetings to all who support freedom! Mr. President of the European Council, my friend Charles, I congratulate you and congratulate all of us on your re-election. I think this is very important and this is right. I am grateful for the opportunity to address you and the nations of Europe. Today it’s already been a month since the Russian invasion. After 8 years of aggression in Donbas. The month of the great war. In short, about its chronicle. Because everything is in my head and everything is fragments. Unfortunately, tragic ones. It all started on February 24. From Russia. When the missiles flew. Early in the morning. Against our peaceful cities. People have still been sleeping. Death has already come. Russia sent armored vehicles against us. Brought several thousand tanks to Ukraine. It’s hard to count how many of them have already been burned. How many can still kill us. Bombs fell on our people. From planes that took off from Belarus. And they didn't even admit that they did it. Russia captured the Chornobyl NPP. Staff have not been released for 24 days there. Imagine, people lived 24 days at such a facility, worked at such a facility. These are our people. So that nothing terrible happens in Chornobyl again. To prevent the catastrophe. And the Russian military held them hostage. Russian tanks fired at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russia fired missiles at Baby Yar. It has already destroyed more than 230 schools and 155 kindergartens. Killed 128 children. Fired missiles at universities. Burns residential neighborhoods with rocket artillery. Whole cities, villages. Just to ashes. Nothing remains. The Russian military killed journalists. Although they saw the inscription \"Press\" on them. They may not have been taught to read. Only to kill. Russia has blocked Mariupol. This is a blockade that no one could have imagined in our time. Hundreds of thousands of people without water, without food. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing. The Russian militaries deliberately blow up hospitals, maternity hospitals, shelters. They even blow up shelters, imagine! Knowing for sure that people are hiding there. They killed 96-year-old Borys Romanchenko in Kharkiv. A Russian projectile flew into his apartment. Into the apartment of a man who survived the Nazi concentration camps, but could not survive Russia that went to our Ukrainian Kharkiv. Thank God, our military stopped Russia there. Russian troops are using phosphorus bombs - it was this morning. Rape women. Loot houses. Destroy churches! All churches. Even those of the Moscow Patriarchate. Abducted more than 2,000 children from Ukraine. We don't know where our children are, where our 2,000 children are. Fire at humanitarian convoys. They don't care who's there. Children, women, church representatives who accompany the humanitarian cargo. They kill people in Donetsk and say it's us. They say it's us, the \"nationalists\". Russia is doing all this. For a month already. On our land. And Ukraine? What is Ukraine doing? It did not go to a foreign land. Never dreamed of any war. Shoots down missiles. Urges strangers to lay down their arms and return home. For the sake of life. Do you understand? For the sake of life. Not death. Heals and feeds war prisoners. Allows them to contact their relatives by phone. Collects the corpses of Russian soldiers from the fields, which they simply leave, abandon. Hundreds and hundreds. Ukraine has united for peace. And for the sake of peace it unites the world. Tries to unblock the besieged cities. Maintains the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Even in the presence of the occupiers. Calls on the IAEA to intervene and patiently explains to the international bureaucracy what is happening. Evacuates people from dangerous areas. Does not stop trying to deliver humanitarian aid. Records Russian war crimes. Gathers evidence. Invites journalists. Maintains the functioning of all institutions of a normal state. Defends its own country! And every morning... Do you hear me? Every morning, the whole state, the whole of Ukraine - children, grandparents - everyone honors the memory of all those who died for our state with a moment of silence. Have you heard anything like this on Russian television? Have you seen this in their schools? They are even ashamed of the word \"war\". They call it a \"special operation\". Although they organized a massacre here, as the Nazis did. These are different worlds. We and they. These are different values. This is a different attitude to life. The Russian military does not see what dignity is. They do not know what conscience is. They do not understand why we value our freedom so much. This is what determines how the country will live. And who should be in Europe. And what about the European Union? I want to thank you - you are united, united around us. But I want to say that it was done in one way or another. But once again, the main thing is that you have united. And we really appreciate that. You have applied sanctions. We are grateful. These are powerful steps. But it was a little late. Because if it had been preventive, Russia would not have gone to war. At least no one knows for sure. There was a chance. You blocked Nord Stream 2. We are grateful to you. And rightly so. But it was also a little late. Because if it had been in time, Russia would not have created a gas crisis. At least there was a chance. And now you and I are preparing Ukraine's membership in the European Union. Finally. Here I ask you - do not be late. Please. Because during this month you have compared these worlds, and you see everything. You saw who is worth what. And you saw that Ukraine should be in the EU in the near future. At least you have everything for that. And we have this chance. Lithuania stands for us. Latvia stands for us. Estonia stands for us. Poland stands for us. France - Emanuel, I really believe that you will stand for us. Slovenia stands for us. Slovakia stands for us. The Czech Republic stands for us. Romania knows what dignity is, so it will stand for us at the crucial moment. Bulgaria stands for us. Greece, I believe, stands with us. Germany... A little later. Portugal - well, almost… Croatia stands for us. Sweden - yellow and blue should always stand together. Finland - I know you are with us. The Netherlands stands for the rational, so we’ll find common ground. Malta - I believe we will succeed. Denmark - I believe we will succeed. Luxembourg - we understand each other. Cyprus - I really believe you are with us. Italy - thank you for your support! Spain - we’ll find common ground. Belgium - we will find arguments. Austria, together with Ukrainians, it is an opportunity for you. I'm sure of it. Ireland - well, almost. Hungary... I want to stop here and be honest. Once and for all. You have to decide for yourself who you are with. You are a sovereign state. I’ve been to Budapest. I adore your city. I have been many times - very beautiful, very hospitable city. And people, too. You have had tragic moments in your life. I visited your waterfront. I saw this memorial… Shoes on the Danube Bank. About mass killings. I was there with my family. Listen, Viktor, do you know what's going on in Mariupol? Please, if you can, go to your waterfront. Look at those shoes. And you will see how mass killings can happen again in today's world. And that's what Russia is doing today. The same shoes. In Mariupol, there are the same people. Adults and children. Grandparents. And there are thousands of them. And these thousands are gone. And you hesitate whether to impose sanctions or not? And you hesitate whether to let weapons through or not? And you hesitate whether to trade with Russia or not? There is no time to hesitate. It's time to decide already. We believe in you. We need your support. We believe in your people. We believe in the European Union. And we believe that Germany will also be with us at the crucial moment. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Free people of our free country! It's already night, but we're working. The country must move towards peace, move forward. With each day of our defense, we are bringing the peace we need so much closer. We are bringing victory closer. Because in this war it is simply impossible for us not to win. And it will be so. And we can't stop even for a minute. Because every minute is about our destiny, about our future. About whether we live or not. The 30th day. It's been a month! If Russia had known it would face that, I’m sure they would have definitely been afraid to come here. During this month, we’ve withstood all the main directions of Russian strikes. The world has applied destructive sanctions. And we are reaching an agreement on new ones. Today I have delivered some important speeches. To the participants of the NATO summit, the G7 summit, to the summit of the leaders of the European Union. To the Swedish Parliament. All this is for the sake of support for our state. We need it for our protection. I spoke with the President of Lithuania, Mr. Nausėda, Prime Minister of Israel Bennett and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson. All this is for Russia to understand one thing: it is necessary to seek peace. Russia also needs to seek peace. I informed the President of Egypt about the current situation. And today I signed some very important decrees. On awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to seven servicemen of the National Guard, to five of them, unfortunately, posthumously. Also on state awards to 240 servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine and 119 servicemen of the Armed Forces. On state awards to 14 heads of local communities, local authorities. On state awards to 31 medical workers. And on awarding the honorary title \"The Hero City of Ukraine\" to four more cities: Bucha, Irpin, Okhtyrka, Mykolaiv. You know, after signing these decrees, I felt that it would really be worthwhile to award and confer the title of hero to millions and millions of our people. To you, to all Ukrainians who are doing everything they can for the sake of victory. For peace. In a place where they are. And I am grateful to each and every one of you. To each and everyone for this month of great struggle. And, of course, to our Armed Forces, of course, the National Guard, our border guards, doctors, rescuers, territorial defense, reconnaissance officers, special services and many, many people, representatives of other professions who save our lives. Who protects our free Ukraine. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to all our people! Glory to us all! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Strong people of the best country in the world! I want to begin this address with words of congratulations. On my own behalf and on your behalf, on behalf of all our citizens of Ukraine to the employees of the Security Service of Ukraine. Today is their day. 30 years ago, on March 25, the Security Service of our state was founded. The Service has come a long way. And we all know that. But we also know that during the eight years of the war in Donbas and during the 30 days of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many members of the Security Service have shown themselves from the best - heroic - side. They have shown themselves principled, courageous and able to inflict losses on the enemy that the enemy does not expect. This is exactly what Ukraine needs now. I am grateful to all our heroes from the Security Service of Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone in the Service who during 30 years of our common history broke the plans of enemies and worked in the interests of the Ukrainian people only. Congratulations on the holiday! Respect to everyone! And we will always remember all the employees of the Service who died for Ukraine while performing tasks to counter Russian aggression. During this month of hostilities, 77 employees of the Security Service were awarded state awards. Two of them were posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Both distinguished themselves in the battles near Makariv, Kyiv region. Thanks to their courageous actions, the enemy headquarters and more than 20 occupiers were destroyed. I can't tell you the names of our heroes. This is the specifics of the service. But I can say with confidence: the memory of them will truly be eternal! Today I signed a decree on state awards to 63 law enforcement officers of Ukraine. Seven of them were awarded posthumously. Police, rescuers, border guards, special service officials of the State Bureau of Investigation and employees of the Court Protection Service. Thank you to everyone! Over the past week, our heroic Armed Forces have dealt powerful blows to the enemy, significant losses. They say that the Minister of Defense of Russia has disappeared somewhere… I wonder if he personally wanted to visit Chornobaivka? I am grateful to our defenders who showed the occupiers that the sea will not be calm for them even when there is no storm. Because there will be fire. As on those Russian ships that departed this week on the famous route from the port of Berdyansk. I want to warn all traitors of Ukraine who sided with the enemy in Crimea years ago. You switched sides because you thought you would live better, right? Not because you want to repeat the tragic fate of your colleagues who died on those ships or somewhere else on land or at sea in Ukraine. Well, live. Stay as far away from our cities and our army as possible. The number of Russian casualties in this war has already exceeded 16,000 killed. Among them are senior commanders. There have not been reports about killed Russian colonels-general or admirals yet. But the commander of one of the occupying armies and deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet are already there. The Armed Forces continue to repel enemy attacks in the south of the country, in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction and in the Kyiv region. By restraining Russia's actions, our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary. Meaningful. Urgent. Fair. For the sake of the result, not for the sake of the delay. 16,000 Russian servicemen have already died. For what? What does it give and to whom? The conversation must be meaningful. Ukrainian sovereignty must be guaranteed. Ukraine's territorial integrity must be ensured. That is, the conditions must be fair. And the Ukrainian people will not accept others. During the week we managed to establish 18 humanitarian corridors. A total of 37,606 people were rescued from the blocked cities. In particular, 26,477 Mariupol residents were evacuated from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia via the humanitarian corridor. The situation in the city remains absolutely tragic. The Russian military does not allow any humanitarian aid into the city. They only use Mariupol residents in fakes for their propagandists. Pretending to start giving something to people. I will continue to inform the nations of other countries in great detail about such disgusting cynicism of the occupiers, about all the war crimes of Russia against the civilians of our heroic Mariupol and other cities of Ukraine. It is very important. I want to emphasize: not only politicians and government officials, but nations. Everyone on the planet needs to know what Russia is doing. So that the responsibility for crimes against the Ukrainian people becomes inevitable and as severe as possible for the Russian military. During the week alone, I addressed the parliaments of Italy, Japan, France and Sweden. I spoke at the summits of NATO, the G7 and the leaders of the European Union. Each of these speeches attracted maximum attention in the respective countries and in the world as a whole. The reviews show that the Ukrainian position was heard. And this is my main goal in such speeches. You know perfectly well what a powerful system of state propaganda Russia has built. They have spent and are spending tens of billions of dollars on it. Probably no one in the world has ever spent such crazy money on lies. But they did not take into account one thing. Where the path of lies needs to be paved with money and the result is not guaranteed, the path of truth is difficult, but the path of truth paves itself. The main thing is to be honest. Next week I will continue this important work for our interests. Interests of Ukraine. Interests of freedom and independence. I had a conversation today with Turkish President Erdoğan. The results of the NATO summit were discussed. Of course, we also talked about the efforts that could bring peace closer to Ukraine and end this senseless Russian invasion of a foreign land. There is important news from our government officials. First. They have already started paying pensions for April. In particular, the Pension Fund has transferred to Oschadbank the entire amount of pensions for the Chernihiv and Luhansk regions. Tomorrow people will have money on their bank cards and Ukrposhta will deliver cash. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, the payment of April pensions will continue in other regions of Eastern and Central Ukraine. The other day a wave of payments will cover the entire state. This is one of our priorities: the Ukrainian state has fulfilled and will fulfill all obligations to our citizens, to our pensioners. Second. Under the eSupport program, more than 20 billion hryvnias have already been paid to people who have lost their jobs or the opportunity to have business. The amount of payment is 6,500 hryvnias. Third. Officials are preparing a new support program for our IDPs from the war zones. Regional administrations have been given a clear task to quickly allocate land for the construction of temporary housing for displaced persons. I want to emphasize once again - this is temporary housing. Once we establish peace, we will begin the immediate, large-scale reconstruction of our state. But now people need a temporary home. Their home. And it is better to have a home in Ukraine than somewhere abroad. We pay aid, we give a job. Native people. Native country. All the details of this support program will be presented by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. And a few more words about the path of truth. About those who bring you and us true information about everything that is happening in our country. I would like to express special gratitude to our journalists today. To all those who ensure the work of the national telethon \"United News\", to all our media people. Correspondents, presenters, editors, media managers, cameramen, directors, video editors, make-up artists, producers - everyone without whom it is impossible to imagine television. Everyone who united and together with other defenders of our people provides Ukrainians with truthful information and, last but not least, confidence 24\/7. I am grateful to all of you! And, I'm sure, I can say this on behalf of all Ukrainians. Glory to you all! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Free people of a free country! Free Slavutych who will not be conquered by the invaders! Today we were all with you - on your streets, in your protest. And all together we tell the occupiers one thing: go home while you can still walk. The Russian invaders entered Slavutych and faced the same reaction there as in the south of our state, as in the east of our country. Ukraine is united in its desire to live freely, to live independently and for the sake of its own dreams, not other people's sick fantasies. Every day of our struggle for Ukraine, every manifestation of our resistance in all areas the occupiers have entered so far proves that Ukraine is a state full of life, which has historical roots and moral foundations throughout its territory. Nothing they do will help the occupiers in the Ukrainian territory they temporarily entered. Disconnection of our television and activation of passionate nonsense speeches by Moscow TV presenters, leaflets with propaganda, distribution of rubles. Rubles, which in Russia will soon be weighed instead of assessing them at face value. Bribing outcasts whom the occupiers are looking for in all the dumps to portray the allegedly pro-Russian government will not help as well. The answer to Russian troops will be one - hatred and contempt. And our Armed Forces of Ukraine will inevitably come. That is why ordinary Ukrainian peasants take captive the pilots of downed Russian planes that fall to our land. That is why our \"tractor troops\" - Ukrainian farmers take Russian equipment in the fields and give it to our Armed Forces of Ukraine. In particular, the latest models that Russia has tried to keep secret. And now the occupiers leave them on our land and just run away... Actually, they do the right thing. Because it is better for them to escape than to die. And there are not and will not be other alternatives. Everyone in Ukraine has united and has been devoting all their energy to the defense of our state for more than a month already. Together with the Armed Forces, together with all our defenders, together with our National Guard. I would like to once again congratulate the National Guard of Ukraine on its day with great respect. I am sincerely grateful for everything you do to protect the state, to protect Ukrainians! Thank you for all the steps to victory that will come and that were made possible thanks to you. Today I presented awards to soldiers of the National Guard who distinguished themselves in battles with the Russian occupiers. I also awarded the rank of brigadier general to five colonels of the National Guard of Ukraine. In total, during the full-scale war since February 24, 476 soldiers of the National Guard have been awarded state awards already. I also spoke today with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Twice. About our people who found protection in Poland. And the need to strengthen our common security. Security of our states. Security for all Europeans actually. What is the price of this security? This is very specific. These are planes for Ukraine. These are tanks for our state. This is anti-missile defense. This is anti-ship weaponry. This is what our partners have. This is what is covered with dust at their storage facilities. After all, this is all for freedom not only in Ukraine - this is for freedom in Europe. Because it cannot be acceptable for everyone on the continent if the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia and the whole of Eastern Europe are at risk of a clash with the Russian invaders. At risk only because they left only one percent of all NATO aircraft and one percent of all NATO tanks somewhere in their hangars. One percent! We did not ask for more. And we do not ask for more. And we have already been waiting for 31 days! So who runs the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it still Moscow because of intimidation? Partners need to step up assistance to Ukraine. These are the words: partners need! Because this is the security of Europe. And this is exactly what we agreed on in Kyiv when the three prime ministers of Eastern European countries, as well as Mr. Kaczynski, arrived in our capital. It was in mid-March. Today, immediately after the conversation with the President of Poland, I contacted the defenders of Mariupol. I am in constant contact with them. Their determination, their heroism and resilience are impressive. I am grateful to each of them! I wish at least a percentage of their courage to those who have been thinking for 31 days how to transfer a dozen or two of planes or tanks… And, by the way, we talked today with our military in Mariupol, with our heroes who defend this city, in Russian. Because there is no language problem in Ukraine and there never was. But now you, the Russian occupiers, are creating this problem. You are doing everything to make our people stop speaking Russian themselves. Because the Russian language will be associated with you. Only with you. With these explosions and killings. With your crimes. You are deporting our people. You are bullying our teachers, forcing them to repeat everything after your propagandists. You are taking our mayors and Ukrainian activists hostage. You are placing billboards in the occupied territories with appeals (they appeared today) not to be afraid to speak Russian. Just think about what it means. Where Russian has always been a part of everyday life, like Ukrainian, in the east of our state, and where you are turning peaceful cities into ruins today. Russia itself is doing everything to ensure that de-russification takes place on the territory of our state. You are doing it. In one generation. And forever. This is another manifestation of your suicide policy. Our representatives - the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defense of Ukraine - met today in Poland with colleagues from the United States. They were joined by US President Joseph Biden. As I was informed, the negotiations concerned, in particular, these vital interests, which I mentioned above. Concerned what we really need while this ping-pong continues - who should give us planes and other protection tools and how. Ukraine cannot shoot down Russian missiles using shotguns, machine guns, which are too much in supplies. And it is impossible to unblock Mariupol without a sufficient number of tanks, other armored vehicles and, of course, aircraft. All defenders of Ukraine know that. All defenders of Mariupol know that. Thousands of people know that - citizens, civilians who are dying there in the blockade. The United States knows that. All European politicians know. We told everyone. And this should be known as soon as possible by as many people on earth as possible. So that everyone understands who and why was simply afraid to prevent this tragedy. Afraid to simply make a decision. Vital decision. Of course, we have already seized a number of Russian tanks, which the military command of this country keeps sending to be burned here. However, the nations of the world will not understand for sure if the battlefield in Ukraine will be a larger supplier of tanks to protect freedom in Europe than our partners. Ukraine's position must be heard. I want to emphasize: this is not only our position. This is the position of the vast majority of Europe's population, the majority of Europeans. If someone does not believe me, look at current public opinion polls in the world. And if you do not want to hear the opinion of the people, then hear the strikes of Russian missiles hitting right next to the Polish border. Are you waiting for the roar of Russian tanks? I also spoke with Prime Minister of Bulgaria Kiril Petkov. In particular, about the humanitarian catastrophe due to the actions of Russian troops and how to save our people. I spoke today at the Doha Forum in the capital of Qatar. This is a respectable meeting that is important not only for the Islamic world, but also for many other countries in Latin America and Africa. These are the regions where Russian propaganda still has great influence. But we are working against lies all over the world. Let Russia know that the truth will not remain silent. And let every nation in the world feel the depth of Russia's injustice against Ukraine. Against everything that keeps the world within morality and humanity. The occupiers committed another crime against history. Against historical justice. Near Kharkiv, Russian troops in their branded inhuman style \"denazified\" the Holocaust Memorial in Drobytsky Yar. During World War II, the Nazis executed about 20,000 people there. 80 years later they are killed a second time. And Russia is doing it. The menorah in Drobytsky Yar destroyed by Russian projectiles today is another question to the entire Jewish community of the world: how many more crimes against our common memory of the Holocaust will be allowed to be committed by Russia on our Ukrainian land? Russian troops are deliberately killing civilians, destroying residential neighborhoods, targeting shelters and hospitals, schools and universities. Even churches, even Holocaust memorials! Russian troops receive just such orders: to destroy everything that makes our nation nation, our people - people, our culture - culture. This is exactly how the Nazis tried to capture Europe 80 years ago. This is exactly how the occupiers act in Ukraine. No one will forgive them. There will be responsibility. Just like 77 years ago. Most likely not in Nuremberg. But the meaning will be similar. You will see. Everyone will see. Everyone. We guarantee. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Strong people of our strong country! Today is the day when we see again and again how far we are from the Russian Federation. Imagine, they were frightened there in Moscow because of my interview to Russian journalists. To those of them who can afford to tell the truth. When journalists were preparing to publish our interview - and we spoke with them this afternoon - the Russian censorship agency came out with a threat. That's what they wrote - they demand not to publish the conversation. It would be ridiculous if it wasn't so tragic. They destroyed freedom of speech in their state, they are trying to destroy the neighboring state. They portray themselves as global players. And they themselves are afraid of a relatively short conversation with several journalists. Well, if there is such a reaction, then we are doing everything right, then they are nervous. Apparently, they have seen that their citizens have more and more questions about the state of affairs in their country. The maximum contrast is my conversation with our favorite Ukrainian TV media representatives. I held a zoom conference with almost five hundred of our media representatives who are creating a telethon \"United News\". I am grateful to them. Although we were limited in time, we talked quite thoroughly. I felt that everyone cares about Ukraine, cares about us and you, cares about our future. I wrote down a lot of questions and suggestions - we will work them out. Today I supported the global marathon for peace in Ukraine. Not just a television one. In dozens of cities around the world, people gathered in support of our state, in support of freedom. That’s a pleasure! An impressive number of people in the squares of Europe, on other continents. And this is extremely important. Because when people are in the square, politicians will no longer pretend not to hear us and you, not to hear Ukraine. I will continue to appeal to the parliaments of other countries. The week is planned to be very busy from a diplomatic point of view. Therefore, no one will be able to hide the Ukrainian interest somewhere in political offices or in bureaucratic loopholes. We will not let anyone forget about our cities, about Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities that the Russian militaries are destroying. More and more people in the world are on the side of Ukraine, on the side of good in this battle with evil. And if politicians don't know how to follow people, we will teach them. This is the basis of democracy and our national character. Once again I want to thank our people in Kherson, Kakhovka, Slavutych and other cities who do not stop resisting the occupiers. If the occupiers had temporarily entered Ukrainian cities, it only means that they would have to leave. And I want to remind those phenomenal fools who are trying to cooperate with Russian troops that they are leaving their own people behind. What will they do to other people's traitors? I would tell them: think about it. But I know that these people don’t have anything to think with. Otherwise they would not have become traitors. Of course, this week we will work for new sanctions against the Russian Federation, against the aggression, sanctions that are needed as long as Russian troops remain on the territory of Ukraine. A new round of negotiations is ahead, because we are looking for peace. Really. Without delay. As I was informed, there is an opportunity and a need for a face-to-face meeting already in Turkey. This is not bad. Let's look at the result. Our priorities in the negotiations are known. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory. Our goal is obvious - peace and the restoration of normal life in our native state as soon as possible. The Armed Forces of our state are holding back the occupiers, and in some areas they are even taking steps forward. Well done. The courage of our defenders, how wisely they behave on the battlefield... This is so important that no words of gratitude will be enough. But again and again I never tire of thanking. To each of our defenders... To all who fight for our future, for our children, for our people. I signed decrees conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine upon 15 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 3 of them posthumously. As well as a decree on state awards to 142 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 5 servicemen of the Department of State Protection of Ukraine. It is a great honor for me to sign such decrees. May the memory of all our heroes live forever. May the memory of everyone who gave life for Ukraine, for us, live forever. Glory to you all! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Wise people of a strong country! Today we have good news. Our defenders are advancing in the Kyiv region, regaining control over Ukrainian territory. Irpin was liberated. Well done! I am grateful to everyone who worked for this result. The occupiers are pushed away from Irpin. Pushed away from Kyiv. However, it is too early to talk about security in this part of our region. The fighting continues. Russian troops control the north of Kyiv region, have the resources and manpower. They are trying to restore the destroyed units. The level of their losses, even at 90%, is not an argument for them to stop. Hundreds and hundreds of units of burned and abandoned enemy equipment do not convince them that this will happen to everyone. Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv regions, Donbas, southern Ukraine - the situation everywhere remains tense, very difficult. This is a ruthless war against our nation, against our people, against our children. As of today, 143 children are known to have died. Mariupol remains blocked. Russian troops did not allow any humanitarian corridor to be organized today, they did not allow \"silence\". Therefore, the situation must now be perceived in a balanced, wise way. As much as possible. Without excessive euphoria from success. But also without getting yourself worked up. We still need time. We still need weapons. We still have to fight, we have to be patient. We can't burn emotions right now. We can't set expectations too high. Just so as not to burn out. I spoke with the leaders of the partner countries. It was a very active diplomatic day. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson, Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau, Chancellor of Germany Scholz, Prime Minister of Italy Draghi and President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev. We agreed with Britain to further support our defense and strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation. Canada also supports a tougher response from the world to the catastrophe created by Russian troops in Ukrainian cities. In a conversation with German Chancellor Scholz, I also paid considerable attention to the need to increase sanction pressure on Russia. I thanked the President of Azerbaijan for the humanitarian support provided to Ukraine, informed about the state of affairs in the territories where Russian troops entered. Italy has agreed to become one of the guarantors of Ukraine's security in the relevant new system of guarantees that we are elaborating. I will continue this activity tomorrow. I will talk to other world leaders. I will work with international organizations, with the nations of Europe and the world. Ukraine cannot and will not agree with the passive sanctions position of some entities towards Russia. There should be no \"suspended\" sanctions packages - that if the Russian troops do something, then there will be some answer... We went through this story last year when we said that strong preventive sanctions against Russia were needed to prevent an invasion. The preventive package was not made. A full-scale war has begun. There are now many hints and warnings that sanctions will be tightened, such as an embargo on Russian oil supplies to Europe, if Russia uses chemical weapons. There are simply no words. Just think about what it all came down to. Waiting for chemical weapons... We, living people, have to wait… Doesn't everything that the Russian military is doing and has already done deserve an oil embargo? Don't phosphorus bombs deserve that? Don't the shelled chemical production or nuclear power plant deserve that? It is important for us that the sanctions packages are effective and substantial enough, given what is already being done against Ukraine by the Russian Federation. If the sanctions packages are weak or do not work enough, if they can be circumvented, it creates a dangerous illusion for the Russian leadership that they can continue to afford what they are doing now. And Ukrainians pay for it with their lives. Thousands of lives. Therefore, starting this week, we are creating a group of experts at the President's Office - Ukrainian and international, who will constantly analyze the sanctions against Russia - what they really influence. Our goal is for the sanctions to work as intended. And so that there is no possibility to circumvent them. This must be a goal for the whole democratic world, without exception. No exception. During the week I will speak in the parliaments of the partner countries: Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Greece, Australia. It is important that these are speeches not only in front of politicians, but also in front of societies. In front of millions of people who want to hear Ukraine and are ready to hear it to help and support. Who feel that we are fighting for our common freedom. One for all people on our earth. I will emphasize everywhere that no one has the right to use the lives of Ukrainians to save any income in Russia or income common with Russia. And Ukrainians should not die just because someone cannot find enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine. Fear always makes you an accomplice. If someone is afraid of Russia, if he or she is afraid to make the necessary decisions that are important to us, in particular for us to get planes, tanks, necessary artillery, shells, it makes these people responsible for the catastrophe created by Russian troops in our cities, too. Because if you could save, you had to save. The peoples of Europe, the peoples of the world will definitely hear and support me. And all politicians should think now what they will have left if they do not correspond to the position of their people. And finally. Already traditional. Just before delivering this address to you, dear Ukrainians, I signed two important decrees on awarding servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with state awards. At the request of our Commander-in-Chief, 302 of our defenders are awarded. I am grateful to all of you for your service! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Mr. Speaker! Mrs. Prime Minister! Members of the Government and the Folketing! Danish people! 40 missiles. Every day, Russian troops use so many different but equally deadly missiles against our state, against Ukraine. This is the average number per day. 40. More than 1,370 missiles have been used in just over a month of Russia's full-scale invasion of our land. This morning the Russian missiles hit one of our southern cities - Mykolaiv. The city of shipbuilders. Absolutely peaceful city, which dreamed of only one thing - to regain the glory of the center of shipbuilding in the Black Sea region. As a result of this strike, the building of the regional administration was destroyed. It is known that seven people were killed and 22 were wounded. Debris removal continues. The Mykolaiv region residents didn't have any military dreams. They posed no threat to Russia. But they, like all other Ukrainians, believe me, have become a target for Russian troops. For missiles, bombs, rocket artillery, mortars. The total number of means of destruction that Russian troops have already used against our people on our land is simply impossible to count. But we can say that the intensity and brutality of the hostilities against us have reached a level even higher than during World War II. The most devastating war for Europe. A month of hostilities - and we already have not one or two, but a whole black list of cities that were completely destroyed by Russian bombing. In dozens of other cities, towns and small villages, residential areas were partially burned, infrastructure was destroyed and enterprises where people worked were blown up. Living, ordinary people. 773 educational institutions - universities, schools, kindergartens - were destroyed. 773. Imagine! And dozens of hospitals, churches, even memorials to Holocaust victims have become targets... The goal of Russian troops in this war is to completely destroy any basis for the normal life of the Ukrainian people. The occupiers are deliberately making sure that nothing is left of Ukraine. Only ruins. Only refugees. More than 10 million Ukrainians have already fled their homes due to the hostilities. Almost 4 million Ukrainians have left our country, most of them women and children. The stories of these people are full of horror. There are still many burned and shot cars on the roadsides in the areas where the Russian military came. Hundreds and hundreds of such cars, what’s left of them. The occupiers were killing civilians even when they were just trying to escape! Along with our immigrants in Europe and the western regions of Ukraine, there are children who were simply picked up on the road near the corpses of their parents. Up to 100,000 people remain in our city of Mariupol, which has been blocked by Russian troops for more than three weeks. While there was snow people melted it to get water. All this time we can't deliver humanitarian goods to the city - they are simply blocked. Water, food, medicine. Everything is blocked by the Russian military. More than 90 percent of all buildings in Mariupol were completely destroyed by shelling and bombs. But Russian aircraft strike without stopping. They purposefully blow up even shelters, although they know for sure that peaceful people are hiding there - women, children, old people. What Russian troops are doing to Mariupol is a crime against humanity that is being committed live in front of the eyes of the entire planet. Why is this even possible? Why can't the world stop this flow of Russia's war crimes ongoing since February 24 this year? The answer is very simple and cynical. People who make decisions in Russia hope that they will get away with it. Sanctions? They think they can be bypassed. An embargo on Russian oil? They see that this is still nothing more than just talking about this important topic. And concern, constant concern. An international tribunal? They know that it takes years to bring specific perpetrators to justice. That is why we appeal to you and to the entire democratic community of the world: sanctions against Russia must be strengthened! Constantly. We need to give up Russian oil, we need to block trade with the Russian Federation, we need to close ports for Russian ships. And this must be the solidarity policy of the European Union, of all the member states. Everyone. It is you, in Denmark, in the country where the basic principles of the European Union, the Copenhagen criteria, come from, who can feel most of all how important it is for all-European solidarity to work for pressure on Russia. Because this pressure is for Russia to seek peace. This is pressure to give the necessary protection to all the basic values on which life in Europe is built and which are now completely trampled by Russia in Ukraine. What can be said about the protection of human rights or freedom on the European continent, if there is no such crime against people and humanity in general not committed by the occupiers? They deport our people to Russia by force, rape women, underage girls, and engage in looting. They have already taken more than two thousand children to Russia, and we do not know where they are, we do not even have a complete list of these children. Do they have families? How will they then find their loved ones? It would be simply impossible for a normal person to imagine the level of evil that was brought to our land! That is why I call on you to raise the issue of solidarity in the defense of freedom, in the defense of humanity at the level of the European Union. There can be no Russian branches in Europe that split the EU from within, that are trying to help Russia make as much money as possible even now. Everyone knows very well who in the European Union opposes humanity and common sense. Who does nothing at all to help establish peace in Ukraine. This must stop, and Europe must stop listening to any excuses from official Budapest. I am grateful to Denmark for its principled position. Thank you to everyone. I am grateful to your people who help Ukraine and help Ukrainians. To your companies that have decided to leave the Russian market. Maersk, Jysk, Lego, Vestas, DSV, Arla Foods, Carlsberg and many other companies who have made this important decision. But I ask you not to stop, to be leaders in Europe in promoting the decisions we really need. Long before this war, it was clear that humanity should reduce the use of fossil fuels. The era of coal and oil has caused huge damage to the environment, to our planet as a whole. Green technologies and green energy have become a logical and just answer to this challenge. European policy is already aimed at reducing the consumption of environmentally hazardous resources. But Russia's aggression against Ukraine and against everything that life in Europe is built on is an argument to accelerate green transformation on the continent. Europe must give up Russian oil, give up as soon as possible! Because it is the crazy income from energy resources that allows the Russian leadership to be bold. Violate generally accepted rules. Promote hatred against other nations, against us and destroy the lives of neighboring countries. If you had to find the complete opposite of what is called the \"Law of Jante\" in your country, it would be the \"Law of Russian Oil\". I am confident that together - only together with all Europeans, with all responsible states on the planet - we will be able to overcome this catastrophe. We will be able to return to peace. We will be able to live together in a European family. I hope this will happen very soon. But it depends on how consistent and principled we remain at this time. At a time when the war continues. However, we have no right now to think only of war. We know there will be peace. We know that we will be able to return to a normal, peaceful life. That is why I want to invite you to join our initiative to rebuild Ukraine after the war, after our victory. We invite your companies, your specialists, your state. Knowing your potential, your creative economic power, I offer your country to take patronage over one of our beautiful regions - after the war. Of course, after the war. Mykolaiv, the city of shipbuilders, can become such a city, such a region, which will unite you and us even more. Which Denmark can help rebuild. Ladies and Gentlemen! Danish people! Now is the dark time in Ukraine. Thousands of candles are placed in our churches in memory of the people whose lives were taken by this war. I know that for you the warm light of candles is a synonym of home comfort, ordinary good human life. Life, which today has become an unattainable dream for many in Ukraine. The Russian invasion continues. But I believe, I know, that we can return to peace. And I ask you to light a candle at home tonight in memory of all Ukrainians whose lives were taken by Russian aggression. May the memory of all who gave their lives for our freedom, world freedom, live forever! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Wise people of a strong country! The 34th day of the full-scale invasion of Russia and our full-scale defense is coming to an end. Successful defense. I'm sure you saw the news today that the Russian military command allegedly decided to \"reduce hostilities in the directions of Kyiv and Chernihiv.\" Well, the same can be said about Chornobaivka - as if the Russian aviation simply decided to fly less, and the Russian military vehicles - to drive less. I am grateful to all our defenders, to all those who ensure the defense of Kyiv. It is their brave and effective actions that force the enemy to retreat in this direction. However, we should not lose vigilance. The situation has not become easier. The scale of the challenges has not diminished. The Russian army still has significant potential to continue attacks against our state. They still have a lot of equipment and enough people completely deprived of rights whom they can send to the cauldron of war. Therefore, we stay alert and do not reduce our defense efforts. Both in the north of our state and in all other regions of Ukraine, where Russian troops have temporarily entered. The defense of Ukraine is the number one task now, and everything else is derived from it. It is on this basis that I consider the messages on the negotiation process, which is underway at various levels with representatives of the Russian Federation. The enemy is still in our territory. The shelling of our cities continues. Mariupol is blocked. Missile and air strikes do not stop. This is the reality. These are the facts. That is why the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and all those who have joined the defense of the state are the only guarantee of our survival today. As a nation. As a state. The guarantee that works. Yes, we can call positive the signals we hear from the negotiating platform. But these signals do not silence the explosion of Russian shells. Of course, we see all the risks. Of course, we see no reason to trust the words of certain representatives of a state that continues to fight for our destruction. Ukrainians are not naive people. Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted. The facts - if they change on our land. Of course, Ukraine is willing to negotiate and will continue the negotiation process. To the extent that really depends on us. We expect to get the result. There must be real security for us, for our state, for sovereignty, for our people. Russian troops must leave the occupied territories. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be guaranteed. There can be no compromise on sovereignty and our territorial integrity. And there will not be any. These are clear principles. This is a clear vision of the possible outcome. And to those on social networks who perceive words as if they are facts already, I want to remind one thing: we live in a democratic state and fight for our freedom. For freedom for our people. Therefore, any decisions that are important for all our people must be made not by one person or a group of people with any political views, but by all our people. The wise people of Ukraine. And certain countries should not even expect that certain negotiations will facilitate the lifting of sanctions against the Russian Federation. The question of sanctions cannot even be raised until the war is over, until we get back what’s ours and until we restore justice. On the contrary, sanctions must be strengthened. Intensified weekly. And they must be effective. Not just for headlines in the media that sanctions have been imposed, but for real peace. Real. And to ensure this, a team of Ukrainian and international experts has already begun work to assess the effectiveness of the sanctions imposed on Russia. On the Ukrainian side, this area is coordinated by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak, and on the international side by Michael McFaul. During the day the rescue operation was ongoing in Mykolaiv. The debris of the building of the regional administration destroyed by Russian missile strikes was dismantled. As of now, 8 people have been reported killed and 30 wounded. It is likely that these are not final figures. The Russian troops hit Mykolaiv very insidiously. At a time when people came to their workplaces in the morning. Thank God, most of those in the building managed to evacuate when they heard an air alarm. This one more act of the Russian so-called denazification of Mykolaiv took place in the morning after the anniversary of liberation of the city from Nazi invaders. Mykolaiv residents remember the day of March 28, 1944. And they see who the Russian troops trying to capture their city now look like. I spoke about Mykolaiv today in my address to the Danish Parliament and the Danish people. I invited the society of this country to take part in the reconstruction of the city and the region after the war. In the framework of our program of Ukraine's reconstruction, we involve partner states, leading companies and the best specialists in order to guarantee the speed and quality of the reconstruction of our state. As I was told, this proposal was very positively received in Denmark. There is also important news from our government officials. As of today, the new functionality of our \"Diia\" state service will be available. As I promised, the state will compensate for the loss of a house or apartment as a result of hostilities. Every citizen of ours can already submit an application in \"Diia\". Applications are already available in the mobile application. You need to update the app to see this new service. And in a week it will be available offline - in the centers of administrative services. In itself, the functionality in \"Diia\" is quite convenient. But all the necessary details will still be clarified by our government. The main thing is that the state will compensate for every meter of lost real estate. In addition, government officials today expanded the program to help those institutions that support IDPs from the areas of hostilities. Another important decision was to allocate 426 million hryvnias to pay the miners' salaries. Traditionally, I signed several important decrees before delivering this evening address. The first is about awarding communications service employees. I am sincerely grateful to everyone who provides the fundamental basis of our lives. Who gives us connection. By the way, on the day of the beginning of the Russian invasion, the first missile strike in the JFO area was made against them. 12 people were awarded state awards, 4 - posthumously. The second signed decree is on awarding 126 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 34 of them - posthumously. We will always be grateful to each of our defenders for the defense of our state in the Ukrainian Patriotic War against Russia. May the memory of everyone who gave life for Ukraine live forever! Glory to each of our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Mr. President of the Storting! Mr. Prime Minister! Members of the Government, dear deputies! Norwegian people! It is a great honor for me to address you on behalf of the Ukrainian people. Today is the 35th day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. After 8 years of war in the east of our state, in Donbas, Russian troops went on the offensive from three directions at once - from the north, east and south. They attacked us on land, in the air and from the sea. Russian missiles and air bombs hit our cities and civilian infrastructure every day and night. There are no forbidden targets for Russian troops. They attack everything. They attack hospitals and airports, food warehouses and residential areas. Ukraine's losses are enormous. Tens of thousands of houses were destroyed, dozens of cities and villages were burned, millions of people were left without the opportunity to live normally. The columns of Russian armored vehicles are not decreasing. Although we have already destroyed more Russian tanks and other combat vehicles than Moscow has lost in any war in the last 50 years. Russia's treacherous actions at sea deserve special attention, as it is one of the greatest threats to international security of all that has emerged since World War II. Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov have been blocked by Russia since the first day of their invasion. About a hundred ships cannot enter the Mediterranean Sea. Some ships were simply hijacked - this is piracy for theft of cargo. Several ships were fired at. But the blockade of ports was implemented by Russia not just by the navy. They mined the sea. And now the mines planted by Russian forces are drifting at sea. And this is a danger for anyone: for any ships and ports of any country in the Black Sea region. One of these mines was recently cleared in time in the Bosphorus. Another - near the Bulgarian border. Another - near the coast of Romania. I don't even want to imagine what will happen if some of these mines are not cleared in time. Who will be affected then? Maybe ferries, God forbid. Or passenger liners. Or merchant ships. Or possibly tankers, the explosion of which could lead not only to human casualties, but also to a large-scale environmental disaster. And then Russia will say again, as always, that it is not them. As it has said many times when killing critics of the Russian government in Europe or even shooting down the Malaysian Boeing in the sky over Donbas. The war is not limited to our borders now. No other state since World War II and the Nazi aggression at sea has posed such a threat to free navigation as Russia has already posed. Think about it - how do they look at it in those regions of the world where there are potential aggressors and new wars with neighbors are quite possible? They are waiting there to see if Russia will be punished enough for its actions. These horrible, aggressive actions. If not, you will see: everything we are experiencing now will be repeated in other regions. Ladies and Gentlemen! Norwegian people! We have no common borders with you, but we have a common neighbor who denies all our common values. For the Russian state in its current condition neither the freedom of nations nor the freedom of human matters. In Russia, universally recognized human rights are denied. It's not that there is no security for minorities, they can just be killed there. And they are being killed. I'm sure you know all about it. You know that there is no rule of law and fair trial. You know that splitting and destroying European democracies is a long-standing policy of the Russian Federation. Russia's war against Ukraine simply continues all this. It is an attempt to destroy everything that Europe is holding on to, what we are holding on to. Therefore, it is an aggression that aims to go beyond our borders. I think you are experiencing new risks near your border with Russia. A number of Russian troops that has no normal explanation has already been amassed in the Arctic region. For what? Against whom? The future of Europe - the whole continent from north to south, from west to east - is being decided right now. On our land, on Ukrainian soil, in Ukrainian air, in Ukrainian sea. So that your soldiers do not have to defend NATO's eastern flank, so that Russian mines do not drift to your ports and fjords, so that your people do not have to get used to the sound of air alarms and so that Russian tanks are not amassed at your border, we must stop the aggression of the Russian Federation together and only together. I am grateful to your Government and to the whole of your society for the tangible support you have already given to our state. Including for the help with weapons. You have taken historic steps by giving us what we need in the struggle for freedom and against tyranny. But the war continues. Russia is sending new forces to our land to continue to destroy us, to destroy Ukrainians. We must do more to stop the war! The first and most important thing is weapons. Freedom must be armed no worse than tyranny. I will be very specific in these walls, in your walls. Believe me, we are losing specific people, specific cities are being destroyed. So I want to make it clear what we need. In particular, anti-ship weapons - Harpoon missiles, as well as air-defense systems - NASAMS. In addition, we need weapons to destroy armored vehicles and artillery systems. All the weapons you can help us with will be used only to protect our freedom, your freedom. Only to protect the freedom and security you enjoy with other Europeans. The second thing is sanctions. The only way that can motivate Russia to seek peace. I am convinced that the country that annually awards the Nobel Peace Prize understands better than anyone else what peace is worth and how we need it. How valuable every effort on the way to peace is. Therefore, new sanctions packages must be introduced weekly, without pauses. The stronger they are, the sooner we will restore peace. I am grateful to Norway for joining the EU sanctions. But I ask you to do something else as well. It is important that European companies do not help this military machine, which has already killed thousands of our people, destroyed dozens of cities completely. No krone, I beg you, no euro of taxes that help Russian aggression! For example, your company MOTUS TECH and other companies must stop supporting Russia's ability to destroy neighbors. How can one supply ship equipment to Russia when it uses its fleet to mine the sea and destroy any opportunities for free navigation? Also, the European Union, and therefore, I hope, Norway, must finally implement a ban on Russian ships using ports on the continent. As long as Russia blocks our ports, it has no right to use all the ports of the free world. I want to emphasize: this is not a question of money, no! This is a question of freedom and security of navigation in the world. Third, you are one of the most responsible suppliers of energy resources in the world. Confidence of the whole world in Norway has always been and I am sure will be at the highest level. This contrasts sharply with Russia's behavior in energy supplies. It is you who can make a decisive contribution to Europe's energy security by providing the necessary resources for both the European Union and Ukraine. We have already started a dialogue on the supply of about 5 billion cubic meters of gas to Ukraine for the next heating season. I hope this will be the basis for our long-term cooperation in this area. Ladies and Gentlemen! Norwegian people! Looking at our common path, we always meet in history in difficult yet defining moments for Europe. Like a thousand years ago, when the Norwegian Vikings were frequent visitors in Kyiv and participated in the formation of the first Kyiv state. Or - Garðaríki. This is what the lands of Rus’-Ukraine were called in Scandinavian sagas. The country of fortresses. The country of cities. Both our and your ancestors lived in them more than a thousand years ago. Today, Russian bombs are flying at our land and our people. At the land where the Ukrainian Princess Elisiv of Kyiv was born and grew up. Wife of King Harald III of Norway, mother of King Olaf the Peaceful, grandmother of Magnus III, great-grandmother of Eystein I and Sigurd the Crusader. These are the pages of our common history! History of Kyivan Rus’. And this history was created on this land and by our people. And we are defending it together again. This was the case 77 years ago, when Ukrainians, along with other peoples of the anti-Hitler coalition, liberated European land from Nazi invaders. Fedir Kompaniyets, a Ukrainian from the Sumy region, was the first soldier to enter the liberated Kirkenes in October 1944 at the head of his unit. Now in his small homeland - in the Sumy region - fierce battles with Russian invaders are taking place. Ukrainians united as much as possible to repel this aggression. To protect our state and our way of life - democratic, free, with full protection of rights and freedoms for everyone. The price is horrible for us - today we know about the death of 145 children, and this is only an officially confirmed number. It is not possible to establish the full number of dead in the occupied areas. It is likely that we have lost hundreds - think about it! - hundreds of children. Just children. After this war we will have not only to rebuild the country physically - rebuild our cities, demine our land, our sea. We will have to rehabilitate people, both military and civilian. Heal after injuries, after everything they had to go through. I know that your country has a lot of experience in rehabilitation. And this is something you can also help us with. And now I invite you to join our project of reconstruction of Ukraine. The colossal losses we have suffered mean that the amount of recovery, the amount of investment required will also be colossal. As one of the world's most responsible investors, Norway can do much to restore stability in Eastern Europe. And then, I am sure, we in Ukraine will be able to adopt one of your extraordinary traditions. A wonderful tradition. The one that characterizes you the most - peaceful people, a society built on the principles of good. Every year on May 17, on Constitution Day, you organize an extremely sincere celebration - a parade of schoolchildren. Children from all over Norway take part in it. This year, our children will go with your children - Ukrainians who came to you for protection and security. And I hope that soon, when we manage to restore peace in Ukraine together, and it will happen, I will be able to invite you, to invite you and your children to take part in such a parade in Kyiv on one of our holidays. To celebrate our common freedom, our common right to a happy future for our children. In peace. In Ukraine. In Europe. Because, as they say, if a rock breaks off from Europe, Europe becomes smaller. So, we must do everything to ensure that a rock like Ukraine is always with Europe. Only together. Thank you Norway! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Today I have few words, not much time, a lot of emotions and even more tasks. It is that kind of moment. A turning point, when we can and should talk only about the most important thing. Yes, there is an ongoing negotiation process. But these are still words. So far no specifics. There are also other words about the alleged withdrawal of Russian troops from Kyiv and Chernihiv. About the alleged reduction of activity of occupiers in these directions. We know that this is not a withdrawal, but the consequences of exile. Consequences of the work of our defenders. But we also see that at the same time there is an accumulation of Russian troops for new strikes in Donbas. And we are preparing for this. We do not believe anyone - we do not trust any beautiful verbal constructions. There is a real situation on the battlefield. And now - this is the most important thing. We will not give up anything. And we will fight for every meter of our land, for every our person. In the current situation of our state, there should be no such discussions to which society and our politicians are accustomed in peacetime. If someone pretends to be able to teach our Armed Forces how to fight, how to resist the enemy, the best way to do it is to go to the battlefield directly. Not from a chair at home or from the place where you left for safety. But from the area of real hostilities. If you are not ready for this, you should not even start teaching our defenders. Today was a very active diplomatic day for me. A difficult one. Priorities are known. There are three of them: weapons for Ukraine, new sanctions against Russia and financial support for our state. A conversation took place with US President Biden. Very detailed, lasted an hour. Of course, I thanked the United States for a new $ 1 billion humanitarian aid package and additional $ 500 million in direct budget support. And I stressed that right now is a turning point. I told President Biden what Ukraine needs. And I was as sincere as possible with him. The support of the United States is vital for us. And now it is especially important to lend a hand to Ukraine, to show all the power of the democratic world. And if we want to fight for freedom together, then we ask our partners ... And if we really fight for freedom and protection for democracies together, then we have the right to demand help in this crucial difficult moment. Tanks, planes, artillery systems... Freedom must be armed no worse than tyranny. I also spoke about this today in an address to the Norwegian parliament and people. To one of the states that supported us significantly. I called for more help to Ukraine. With weapons and sanctions against Russia as well. I spoke today with the President of Egypt and the Crown Prince of the United Arab Emirates. I have done, am doing and will do my best so that our people can defend themselves until justice is restored. On Ukrainian soil and in the Black Sea region. This is our fundamental interest. This is our survival. It is for the survival of the Ukrainian people that we are now fighting. In this war, without exaggeration, the Patriotic War against Russia. And now I want to mention a few more important things. First. There are those who work together with everyone to defend the state. So that Ukraine can gain its future. We appreciate the work of each such person. And there are those who waste time and work only to stay in office. Today I signed the first decree to recall such a person. Such an Ambassador of Ukraine. From Morocco. The Ambassador from Georgia was also recalled. With all due respect: if there are no weapons, no sanctions, no restrictions for Russian business - please look for another job. I look forward to concrete results in the coming days from our representatives in Latin America, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa. I expect the same results from military attaches in the coming days. The diplomatic frontline is one of the key frontlines. And everyone there must work as efficiently as possible to win and help the army. Each on the diplomatic frontline must work just as each of our defenders on the battlefield. And the second point. Traditionally, today, before delivering this address, at the request of the Commander-in-Chief, I signed a decree on state awards to our military. 122 defenders, 23 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Distinguished Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Mr. Speaker of the House of Representatives! Dear Mr. President of the Senate. Dear leader of the opposition! Ladies and gentlemen, members of the government, senators and members of the parliament! Australian people! Thank you for the great honor of speaking to you today. In May 2016, thousands of Australians gathered at Perth Airport to see the Ukrainian \"Mriya\" for the first time. \"Mriya\" is the name of our An-225 aircraft. \"Mriya\" is a dream in English. After covering almost 15,000 kilometers, it delivered to Australia an urgent cargo - a 130-ton electric generator, which your enterprise desperately needed. Delivery by sea would take several months. And the Ukrainian plane did it in a few days. We have always been proud of our \"Mriya\". Not because it is the largest on the planet. First of all because it helped people from all over the world by delivering food, drinking water, equipment for peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. In 2019, after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our \"Mriya\" constantly delivered the most necessary medical supplies. That saved people. Adults, children - all. In different countries, on different continents. \"Mriya\" was bringing life. But now it is impossible. Impossible, because there is a state that has completely different values than we have, than you have, than the whole civilized world has. And this state started a full-scale war against us. It bombs and shells peaceful cities and villages, killing our peaceful people. Kills children. Arranges blockades of cities, holding hundreds of thousands of people hostage without water, food, light and heat. Daily. It separates thousands of children from their parents and takes them out, or rather kidnaps them, forcibly relocating to its territory. And on February 27, as a result of fighting in the city of Hostomel, our plane \"Mriya\" was burned. Can we say that Russia has destroyed our dream? No. It burned the plane, it burned the iron. It destroyed matter, not soul. The shell, not the essence. Not freedom. Not dignity. Not independence. We know that our dream cannot be defeated and destroyed. Especially if we can count on the support and help of the free world. On your support, on your help. And as in the story I told above, it is not needed in a few months, it is needed now. Ladies and Gentlemen! Australian people! The distance between our states is great, thousands of kilometers. We are divided by the seas and oceans, the territories of dozens of other countries, time zones. But this distance simply does not exist for the cruelty and chaos that Russia has brought to Eastern Europe, to the region of our Black and Azov Seas, to our Ukrainian land. Everything that is happening in our region due to Russia's aggression and that is destroying the lives of our people has already become a real threat to your state and your people. Because this is the nature of evil - it can instantly overcome any distance and any barriers. Destroy life. For decades, there has been no such threat of nuclear strikes as there is now. Because Russian officials and state propagandists are openly discussing the use of nuclear weapons against those who do not want to obey Russian demands. For decades, it has not been the case that one state completely blocked the sea for another state and all merchant ships of any country. But that is exactly what Russia has done. Our part of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov is now a completely dead sea. And any ship that tries to enter our waters can simply be destroyed by the Russian fleet. More than a hundred merchant ships under various flags are blocked by Russia in our ports! For decades, there has never been a state in the world that has started a war against a neighboring people, openly declaring its conquest or destruction. So that not even the name of this nation remains, so that there is no possibility of free life for this nation. Russia has already returned to the world the worst pages of the XX century. The greatest threats of that century. It returned the evil that humanity has long hoped to forget. But the worst thing is that if Russia is not stopped now, if Russia is not brought to justice, some other countries in the world that dream of a similar war against their neighbors will decide that this is possible for them as well. The fate of global security is being decided now. No human is capable of controlling the wind and precipitation on the planet, and therefore no one will be able to save one or another part of the Earth from radiation pollution due to the use of nuclear weapons. No state on the planet should have even a theoretical possibility to block maritime trade routes and even more so to completely close the sea to other states. I repeat once again: there should not even be a theoretical possibility! No ruler in the world should count on impunity when considering the prospect of war. Ladies and Gentlemen! Australian people! After 36 days of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, it is safe to say that there is no other way in the world to guarantee global security than to force Russia into silence, into peace. And also to bring it to justice - this is important - for everything it has done against global security. A state that does not shy away from nuclear blackmail should immediately receive sanctions that demonstrate that blackmail has devastating consequences for the blackmailer. Effective tools are also needed to bring to justice any state that blocks maritime trade routes. So that no one even has such a temptation - to make the sea dead. Now there are simply no such tools in the world. Therefore, Australia's leadership can be indispensable in modernizing the global security architecture. As well as in strengthening our anti-war coalition, which is now working to return peace to Ukraine. It is also necessary to improve the capacity of international institutions created for the responsibility of war criminals and those who commit any criminal act for which the whole world can punish in solidarity, not just one state alone. If this was done in time, life in the world would be much safer. I am sure that each of you, as well as each of us Ukrainians, remembers the tragedy of MH-17. Malaysian Boeing shot down by the Russian occupiers in the sky over the Ukrainian Donbas. Then 298 people died. My condolences to all the families who lost their loved ones. But was it possible to bring to justice those who caused this tragedy? No. They are hiding in Russia. And, obviously, received security guarantees from the Russian state. Has Russia paid compensation to the relatives of the victims? No. It still denies its guilt in the tragedy. Eight years have already passed and justice has not been restored yet. And no one knows how much longer it will take for at least one tragedy to receive a worthy response from the international community, from all of us. And how many more new tragedies has Russia created or will create? It is often said that unpunished evil returns. I would add: unpunished evil returns winged, with a sense of omnipotence. If the world had punished Russia for what it did in 2014, there would be none of the horrors of this invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We need to fix these terrible mistakes now. I am grateful to Australia for its bipartisan support for our defense against invaders. For the help that your state has already given us. In particular, for 70 thousand tons of coal for the needs of our energy. But this is just the beginning. Together we can, and therefore must do more. New sanctions against Russia are needed. Strong sanctions. As long as it doesn’t abandon nuclear blackmail, the blockade of the sea, it must pay the highest price. No Russian ship should be allowed into the ports of the free world. Buying Russian oil means paying for the destruction of the foundations of global security. Any business activity with Russia must be completely stopped. Not a single dollar for the elimination of people! Any attempt by Russia to circumvent sanctions must also be stopped. After all, what kind of sanctions are these, if they can be circumvented thanks to simple schemes? But above all, we must arm those who are really fighting for freedom. For evil to lose and for Russia to seek peace, Ukraine must have everything it needs on the battlefield. For example, you have wonderful Bushmaster armored vehicles that can significantly help Ukraine. As well as other models of equipment and weapons that can strengthen our position. If you have the opportunity - Ukraine will be grateful to you. Now in Ukraine they will definitely do more for our common freedom, for our common security than being covered with dust on your land. The Ukrainian people have already shown the world how sincerely we value freedom. How consistently we are ready to defend it. Our heroes are fighting against the army that is considered one of the strongest in the world. But all our people, without exception, are already thinking about the future. About how we will live after the war. How we will rebuild our country, our Black Sea region. We invite the world's leading countries, leading companies and the best specialists to join the project of Ukraine's reconstruction. Take patronage of a region, city or industry of your choice in our country that needs restoration. Your state has given Ukraine a special status of a like-minded country. But we are not only related in our thoughts - we are also related in our dreams. Therefore, I invite your beautiful country to look closely at our southern regions, at our coasts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Restoration of our ports, development of such cities as, for example, Kherson, which is fighting for its freedom today, restoration of the maritime industry of Ukraine can be a special contribution to stability for you after this terrible war. Together with the fundamental protection of free navigation, this will restore the strength of the old but correct words: whoever is able to defend freedom at sea, is able to defend freedom in the world. I believe you can do it! And I hope that the Ukrainian community of Australia, our strong Ukrainian community, will join this common work. It will support us now as much as in previous years. Dear friends, the geographical distance between us is insane. Thousands of kilometers. But what does this distance mean for those who have a common understanding, who see the world the same way, who are bitterly disturbed when the enemy comes, when children are killed, when cities are destroyed, when refugees are shot on the roads, when a peaceful country is turned into a burned territory? Then any distance disappears. Geography means nothing. Only humanity matters. Only a dream of returning to a peaceful life. A dream we will fulfill. Definitely. And definitely together. Thank you! Thank you Australia! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Mrs. Speaker! Dear members of parliament! Mr. Prime Minister! Mark! Dear Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Defense! Dutch people! I have the great honor of becoming the first foreign head of state to address the House of Representatives of the Netherlands and your people. In this format, at such a time. I am sincerely grateful for this opportunity. For the fact that in these critical circumstances in which my country and our entire continent found themselves, I can explain to you directly what is happening and why it is so important to be together now for all of us, for all Europeans. For all who value peace on our planet. Peace for which millions of people have fought, generations of Europeans. And which was destroyed by one decision, in one moment. So much has been done since World War II so that what Ukraine is experiencing right now never happens again. But everything repeats. Unfortunately. Only so far for one European country, not for the whole continent. But World War II began with the destruction of individual states as well. And then it led to the tragedy of Rotterdam, the terrible bombing of London and the massacre that engulfed all of Europe. If peace on the continent had not been preserved, if the great war had returned with no less brutality than 80 years ago, no one could have a reason to believe that certain state borders would manage to deter aggression. Especially since many in Russia want to carry this aggression further, further to Europe. The shadow of those ruins of Rotterdam is already hanging over many European cities. Ukraine is just the beginning, if Russia isn’t stopped. If we don't stop it immediately! 36 days! 36! That is how long our state, our people have already been fighting alone against the army, which was considered among the strongest in the world. Russia has been preparing for this campaign against us, against freedom, against our people for decades. They have accumulated as many resources to spend on war, on death, as not every European country can spend on life. And now these Russian resources are working at full capacity and, by the way, tirelessly. They work in such a way that... No matter how scary it may sound, people are already getting used to it. The world is beginning to adapt. They start to ignore everything they hear about the war. They are getting used to the news about the new bombing of our peaceful cities. About new missile strikes. They are getting used to the updated lists of those killed. Daily reports of the number of destroyed houses and shelled cities and communities no longer evoke emotions. For many others, the war in Ukraine is becoming routine. Unfortunately, this is true. Routine. But not for those whose lives are in danger every minute. Who, as residents of our city of Mariupol, has been under complete blockade for more than three weeks already. Without everything: without life, without food, water, basic medicines, without communications. Who is forced to stay in basements, hide anywhere just so as not to die under fire. But not for those whom Russia has taken to its territory. Simply deported, as the Nazis did in the occupied countries. Thousands of Ukrainian children and tens of thousands of adults were forcibly transported to the territory of the occupying state. Unfortunately, we do not know anything about the fate of most of them. How to return them? Will they lose touch with their relatives? Will Russia give back these people, these children? These are horrible questions for us. And for some it is becoming a routine that one should not even pay attention to. We are now at a time when we need to act even faster, even more powerfully than during the first month of the war. When the peoples of Europe, the peoples of the world saw what Russia was doing. And they are all full of indignation, full of desire to help. It's true. But people's attention and emotions do not focus on the same thing for long. If the situation is not resolved, people may switch to something else. We have no right to give this war another 36 days! We must all work together to make Russia seek peace as soon as possible! Hundreds of children were killed. Thousands of people were killed. Tens of thousands of houses were destroyed. Burned cities, villages. Russian occupiers rape women in occupied areas. They loot everything they can, everything they find. They even kill not to achieve any military success anymore. Not to sow terror. They started killing because it is fun for them! Entertainment for people who have as many weapons as they want and no deterrents. We will never accept this! And we will never stop defending ourselves! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dutch people! I know that tomorrow your country will celebrate 450 years since the beginning of the armed uprising against tyranny. A fundamental event for your state, for your society. Under normal circumstances, in my address to you, I would talk about it as you are used to hearing it. As about history, a historical moment. As about your heritage. As about the achievements of generations of people who lived 450 years ago. But today, as my country struggles against tyranny, I will speak about it solely as about a current event, as about something that must happen here and now. The faster the better. What was the goal of the founders of the Netherlands? Obviously: freedom, democracy, human dignity, cohesion, cultural, religious diversity. Since then, the path to everything that shows modern Europe has continued. To the free life of dozens of different nations together - in a single space. To tolerance, which provides an unprecedented level of human respect for each other in human history. And all this is now under attack again. All this now needs to be defended again. To be defended in the east of Europe, to be defended in our state, in Ukraine. So far only in Ukraine… So far there is a chance to stop the tyranny on our land and drive it back, beyond our Ukrainian border. I am grateful to you, politicians, I am grateful to all ordinary people for the extremely strong support of my state, our people at this time. For leadership in sanctions. For the principled stance in business activity related to the Russian Federation. For the help you provide to Ukrainian immigrants who have felt family care in your society. This is all extremely valuable! But Russia does not cease hostilities on the territory of Ukraine. Exactly on the territory of Ukraine. And we have to do much more to restore peace. To protect freedom. To save us as a state. And to really ensure one vital fact: there will never be another war in Europe. Never again! In 2014, the world did not fully understand why the Russian occupiers came to our land. Then - to the land of Crimea, partly - to the land of Donbas. And you felt it. After they shot down a Malaysian Boeing flying from Amsterdam. There can be no doubt that this is a totally unjust war. This is a war that the Russian state cannot be forgiven. Hundreds and hundreds of crimes for which everyone must be held accountable. All those who gave criminal orders. Everyone who carried out these criminal orders. And all those who provided political cover for these criminal orders. Your city, The Hague, the capital of international justice, knows exactly how to do it. I'm sure they will do it! To assert international law. To assert the rule of law. To assert justice that is clear to everyone on Earth. But for that to happen, sanctions need to be stepped up. Together with other EU countries, you have to do everything possible so that Russia does not have the resources to continue this war, the war in Europe, and so that there is no political opportunity to hide criminals. Close your ports to Russian ships! Together with all other EU countries. Stop any trade with this country that has forgotten all the lessons of World War II! Get ready faster to give up Russia's energy resources, so that billions, billions of euros for them do not go to arms production and mass killings in Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dutch people! Tyranny must lose. Tyranny must always lose. And for that to happen, freedom must get all the weapons it needs to win, to defend itself. The weapons that are available on the continent. The weapons you have. Ukraine is grateful for the support it has already received from you. From your society. From your state. This support is truly unprecedented. It is truly the support of a leader. But the war is so intense, Russian troops are so active that we need more. \"Stingers\" and \"Panzerfausts\" allow you to hold on, to fight. However, this is not a weapon of victory. We desperately need weapons that can make our skies safe, that we can use to unblock our cities where Russia is artificially creating famine. We need weapons that can drive the occupiers out of our land. Aircraft, tanks, NASAMS air-defense systems and Spike anti-tank systems, shells, missiles and more. You have this list. And I hope you will find an opportunity to help us as much as you can, to help us with that. The second point. I urge you to influence international institutions! The crimes of the Russian occupiers must be punished. Deportations, massacres, destruction of civilian infrastructure, bombing of hospitals - all this must be answered by the democratic community. Imagine: Russian troops are deliberately destroying our agricultural sector! They are mining fields, they are blowing up agricultural machinery now. They are doing everything to destroy our potential, agricultural potential, and provoke a food crisis. Not only in Ukraine - in the world. And they are doing it in a country that could become one of the most powerful agricultural centers in Europe and the world. But I am confident that we will be able to overcome all this. I am confident that together we will be able to build even more potential. And become a truly global agricultural power. Third. We already have to think about rebuilding Ukraine. About how we all - not only Ukrainians, but all Europeans - will return to a peaceful life. I dream of this day. The day when Ukrainian immigrants who arrived in the European Union after the beginning of the Russian aggression will be able to say \"thank you\" and return home. Return to rebuilt cities, to restored Ukraine. And I invite your country to join this project - the project of reconstruction of Ukraine. I urge you to choose a city, a region of our state that can see your care, can feel what you can do. And for everyone in your country who still has doubts to definitely feel that we, Ukrainians, can be with you - in the European Union. I am convinced that this will reinforce our common European home. And will make the European project even more perfect. I believe that this will happen very soon! Because it is absolutely rational. With our potential, with our people, with our ability to defend freedom. And you know this perfectly well! And you know very well, my friend Mark, that our accession to the European Union depends very much on you, on your country. I want to thank you for everything! Thank you, the Netherlands! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mrs. President of the Chamber of Representatives! Dear Mrs. President of the Senate! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, deputies and members of the government! Dear Belgian people! Eight years of war. 36 days of full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. Did many people expect that our state and our people would be able to resist Russian troops for so long? Let's be honest: no. Few. They thought we would fall under the blows of Russian troops. But we withstood. Our people endured. We are fighting. We are defending our freedom, amazing the world with the courage of Ukrainian heroes, our Armed Forces of Ukraine and all citizens of Ukraine who do not surrender, who believe in victory. In the south of our state there is a city of Mariupol, which you mentioned today. I am very grateful to you, Madam Speaker. One of the most promising and economically powerful cities in Ukraine. That was before this war. And now more than 90% of all buildings in this city are completely destroyed by Russian strikes - aircraft, artillery, mortars, tanks. Thousands of peaceful Mariupol residents died. People are buried just in the city. In the courtyards of high-rise buildings. Or rather, what is left of the high-rise buildings. Mariupol has been under complete blockade for more than three weeks. The Russian military closed all entrances to the city and blocked access from the sea. You all know these details, there is nothing in the city: no water, no food, no medicine, no life. There is nothing you need to sustain any life. But Mariupol does not give up. Mariupol continues to fight the occupiers. Its defenders had a choice - they could leave the city and give it to the Russian invaders. They did not. Every day we try to do everything to make the humanitarian corridors from Mariupol work! To save civilians who still remain in the city. Women and children, the elderly… In part, we succeed. But in most cases, the Russian military does not release people into the free territory of Ukraine. And does not allow any humanitarian cargo into Mariupol. Today it is the most horrific place in Europe. It is hell. It is a catastrophe that everyone knows about, the whole world. But no one is determined enough to help stop the catastrophe in this city and in other cities in our country. And now I want to ask everyone - I want to ask you, I want to ask all Europeans who hear me now. What do the defenders of Mariupol hope for? What do the defenders of other cities, towns and villages of Ukraine hope for? In all those areas where the battles are no less appalling than you had near Ypres. Or maybe it's even worse in Mariupol... I don't know. Do the defenders of our cities hope for the closure of the skies over Ukraine to Russian missiles and aircraft? They know there is no courage to do so. Do they think about whether our state meets the criteria for joining the European Union? Our state, which has already given thousands of lives in the war for freedom in Europe... Do Mariupol residents or defenders of any other city in Ukraine calculate the level of losses of European companies from the termination of business in the Russian market? Do they think about money at all? No. They do not hope for it. Do not calculate it. Because that's exactly what they deserve. Agree, these are completely different worlds. The world of those who really fight for freedom. Here and now. Against tyranny. Against a tyranny that wants to split Europe and destroy everything that unites us. Everything that unites you... And the world of those who are so used to freedom that they don't even want to notice what the struggle for it is worth. The world of those who believe that Russian diamonds in Antwerp, for example, are more important than the war in Eastern Europe. Or the world of those who believe that the accessibility of European ports to Russian ships is more important than the Russian military machine's attempt to destroy the entire nation around you. 40 million Ukrainians! The main question in the life of every person is not what this person hopes for, what this person thinks or calculates... The main question is what this person is worthy of. And I, as the President of a worthy country, address you with quite logical statements. With what is clear to the vast majority of the world, Europe, Europeans in different countries. We have seen these polls, we know how people support us. Our defenders deserve to receive from Europe for the freedom of which they are fighting the weaponry that will definitely stop Russia's offensive, and therefore the onset of tyranny. When we are talking about aircraft, tanks, artillery systems, anti-ship weapons, we are talking about what is really needed. And what the countries of the European Union, the countries of NATO have. Our defenders deserve that European companies finally stop making money together with those who are trying to destroy us. Our defenders deserve not to think about the criteria, but to know that Ukraine will be a member of the European Union. Because if they lose, if we lose Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities, there will be no strong European Union anymore. Because tyranny will come to take away from you everything you possess and are proud of. Of course, we do not wish you this. And this is by no means a threat. This is the reality. We feel it. This is a statement of all the facts we live in. A statement of what is clearly visible from Mariupol - the headquarters of the European resistance. Of what is clearly visible from Ukraine - the headquarters of European dignity. And I am sure that those esteemed headquarters that are located on your beautiful land are fully aware of everything I am telling you. They realize it. Although, perhaps, they do not speak aloud. So let us all together in Europe be worthy of the feats that Ukrainians demonstrate in the war for freedom. For a free Europe and against tyranny. Against Russia. We are grateful to you, very grateful to your state for the support you have already provided. Belgium was one of the first to provide us with defensive assistance. This is a historical moment, a historical gratitude. We will never forget that. You have already warmly welcomed more than 30,000 Ukrainians who left their homes because of this war. But it is you, as the heart of Europe, who can inspire all other Europeans to do more. To help us drive the occupiers out of Ukraine and restore the precious peace. Peace that is worth more than anything, more than any values, more than any diamonds. More than any agreements with Russia. More than any Russian vessel in European ports. More than any barrel of Russian oil. Each of you knows what needs to be done to restore peace. To be truly worthy of Europe. So help us, do it! Weapons. Sanctions. EU membership. And soon the future will thank you. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to the heroic city of Mariupol! Thank you sincerely to your state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 36th day of our nationwide defense after eight years of war in Donbas is coming to an end. It’s hard to believe that, but March has already passed. Absolutely imperceptible! The passage of time is somehow not even noticed. Every day and every night has become virtually the same for us. The same day, the same night. And with one task for all - to protect ourselves, save people, rebuff invaders. Drive them out. All this March and five days of February, the invaders have been trying to break in and gain a foothold in our house from different directions - from land, from the sky, from the sea. They go, fly, swim... There is so much evil in them, so much thirst for destruction that it reminds not of people, but of something otherworldly. Some monsters that burn and loot, attack and try to kill. Some hellish chimeras. But when you are on your land, everything helps you. The land itself, rivers, every person. Everyone, even the one you didn't expect from before. We endured much more than the enemy expected. They said - three or five days. They thought that this would be enough for them to seize our entire state. And it’s already 36. And we are standing. And we will continue to fight. Until the end. Until we have strength and opportunities. So that there are no monsters left on our land. So that if chimeras (points to the House with Chimeras - ed.), then native and good. The ones protecting us. I am sure that it is extremely pleasant for each of you to read and watch the news that Ukrainian cities are gradually being liberated from the occupiers. And so it is. Our Armed Forces, the National Police and the National Guard, intelligence are doing great. Absolute gratitude to them! To the north of Kyiv, in the Chernihiv direction, in the Sumy region, the expulsion of the occupiers continues. They themselves are aware that they can no longer withstand the intensity of hostilities they could have maintained in the first half of March. But we must also realize that for the Russian military, this is part of their tactics. All this is not occasional. We know their plans. We know what they are planning and what they are doing. We know that they are moving away from the areas where we are beating them to focus on others that are very important. On those where it can be difficult for us. That is why it is very important for everyone to show restraint. Restraint in emotions. Restraint in worries. We all equally want to win. Equally! But there will be battles ahead. We still have a very difficult path to cover to get everything we strive for. Of course, everyone should motivate our military, each other, and support our defense. Children - with \"likes\". Parents - with a warm word. Volunteers - with help. The people and the state - with all the resources and opportunities that we have, that are available in Ukraine. Restraint in emotions, readiness to fight until we win and proper motivation for our military are essential elements. I also work on motivation for them. Daily. Like each of us. As always, before delivering the address, I signed a decree awarding our heroes. 136 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Thank you to everyone! And today another decision was made. Regarding antiheroes. Now I do not have time to deal with all the traitors. But gradually they will all be punished. That is why the ex-chief of the Main Department of Internal Security of the Security Service of Ukraine Naumov Andriy Olehovych and the former head of the Office of the Security Service of Ukraine in the Kherson region Kryvoruchko Serhiy Oleksandrovych are no longer generals. According to Article 48 of the Disciplinary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, those servicemen among senior officers who have not decided where their homeland is, who violate the military oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people as regards the protection of our state, its freedom and independence, will inevitably be deprived of senior military ranks. Random generals don't belong here! And to the real heroes of the Security Service - the same absolute gratitude, just as to each and everyone who sincerely defends our state. There are really a lot of heroes among the servicemen. We are grateful to them! The situation in the south and in Donbas remains extremely difficult. The invaders are allocating their sick creativity to the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region. They are trying to organize some of their incomprehensible structures there, they are trying to figure out how to consolidate their presence there. Of course, this is hopeless for them. The more active they are there, the more substantial the losses of Russia itself will be in the end. The losses of Russians themselves. Because who else will pay for the occupation of a foreign land? Also in Donbas, in Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction, Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes. Powerful strikes. We will defend ourselves. We will do everything we can to stop the occupiers and clear our land of their evil and foolish chimeras. Today I addressed the parliaments of our partner countries: Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium. I felt total support. I am waiting for concrete steps. I called for tougher sanctions against Russia. We have to put pressure on the aggressor until the aggression is over. I also spoke about this with President of the European Council Charles Michel. We need more support from our partners right now. When the Russian military is concentrating additional forces in certain areas. In addition to sanctions, we discussed with Charles Michel economic support for Ukraine, financing of priority projects. The dynamics of our movement towards full membership in the EU. The sanctions policy was one of the topics of conversation between Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak and US National Security Advisor Jacob Sullivan. The United States has imposed a new package of sanctions against Russia. We are grateful. It will not allow the current sanctions to be circumvented - we have already noticed such attempts. It will also limit the work of sensitive sectors of the Russian economy - its defense sector. Let Moscow not forget that the sanctions policy will only be continued and intensified. As long as there is no peace - sanctions are needed. Until Russia begins to invest as sincerely in the search for peace as it invests in the destruction of our state, sanctions will remain unalterable. I also held talks with President of Turkey Erdoğan today. We spoke very specifically. In particular, about the prospects of negotiations in Turkey with the Russian Federation. And also about the creation of an effective system of guarantees for our state. About the security we have always needed and to the real provision of which we have come closer. I am grateful for Turkey's readiness to become a guarantor of security for Ukraine. And finally. Both I and government officials have already said that the \"Diia\" state service has started accepting applications for compensation for the destroyed real estate of our citizens. The state will return to our people everything that the occupiers destroyed - houses, apartments, etc. In a few days, 25,491 applications have already been submitted. The number of residents in these houses and these apartments, which were destroyed, according to our estimates is 63 thousand 471 people. But we know that more needs to be restored. Much more. So tell everyone who needs it about such a government program. An important program. The opportunity to submit applications will soon be available offline, in the administrative service centers, in the mode usual for many Ukrainians. No matter what, we all have to think about the future. About what Ukraine will be like after this war. How we will live. Because this is a war for our future. This is a war for our lives, in which we have only one way - to gain peace for Ukraine. To gain Ukraine's security. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our dear defenders! This day, April 1, the occupiers decided to mark with two equally silly jokes. One such joke is about people in Russia. They started the spring conscription, which looks traditional, but is still different from the usual. Because this year's conscripts can be sent to war against our state, against our people. So, this is a guaranteed death for many very young guys. And although they are not our citizens, although they are citizens of the state that is at war with us on our land, it is still our duty as people to warn. Warn each such conscript, their parents. We don't need more dead people here. Save your children so that they do not become villains. Don't send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. At home. At their home. The Russians won’t be told the whole truth about this conscription and about the fate of the conscripts. But still, if you can convey the truth to them - do it. I want to dwell on the fact that the Russian Federation is trying to take people into the army in Crimea. This is a violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime for which there will be responsibility. And which is also an argument for increasing sanctions against Russia. That's why I want to tell the people of Crimea: sabotage this story. At any stage. And if it doesn't work out, don't fulfill criminal orders and surrender to the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the first opportunity. We will understand everything. You will live. The occupiers played a second very silly April Fool's joke with some residents of the southern regions of Ukraine, where Russian troops had temporarily entered. They appoint some \"Gauleiters\", some temporary leaders. And they are threatening employees of enterprises and authorities to cooperate with these deceived appointees. My message to them is simple: the responsibility for collaboration is inevitable. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is a secondary issue. The main thing is the inevitability that justice will be restored. Therefore, everyone who became a Gauleiter can already register somewhere in Rostov. And there will be problems for cooperation with them or with the occupiers directly. This is the last warning. The occupiers are withdrawing forces in the north of our country. The withdrawal is slow but noticeable. Somewhere they are expelled with battles. Somewhere they leave positions on their own. After them a complete disaster and many dangers are left. It's true. Firstly, the bombing may continue. Secondly, they are mining all this territory. Mining houses, equipment, even the bodies of killed people. Too many tripwire mines, too many other dangers... We are moving forward. Moving carefully. And everyone who returns to this area must also be very careful! It is still impossible to return to normal life as it was. Even in the areas we return after the fighting. You will have to wait. Wait for our land to be cleared. Wait until you can be assured that new shelling is impossible. In the east of our country, the situation remains extremely difficult. The Russian militaries are being accumulated in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction. They are preparing for new powerful blows. We are preparing for even more active defense. We use all opportunities - both internal and external. Necessarily. I emphasize once again: hard battles lie ahead. Now we cannot think that we have already passed all the tests. We all strive for victory. But when it comes everyone will see it. Everyone will feel that peace is coming. In the afternoon I spoke with President of France Macron. About the humanitarian situation in the Ukrainian cities shelled by the occupiers. The situation in Mariupol was discussed separately. For which, I hope, there may still be a solution. Europe has no right to react in silence to what is happening in our Mariupol. The whole world must react to this humanitarian catastrophe. Today humanitarian corridors worked in three regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia. 6,266 people were rescued. In particular, 3,071 people from Mariupol. We are separately agreeing on the removal of the wounded and dead from the city. Our military, our civilians - all citizens. We are talking about this with Turkey as a mediator. Hopefully I will be able to report the details soon. In the afternoon I met with President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola. Met in Kyiv. I am grateful to her for this important visit, which demonstrates to some other politicians that courage at a time like this is one of the most important traits for a politician. We talked about how to accelerate Ukraine's accession to the European Union. There are specifics. We also talked about arms supplies and support of European parliamentarians in this. And also about the sanctions policy. About a deeper sanctions policy against Russia. Because if there is an embargo, then it is an embargo. If there is SWIFT, then it is for all banks. And if it is business with Russia, it is not just a suspension of activities, but a complete withdrawal of European companies from the Russian market. Traditionally, I signed a decree on awarding our defenders. Seven servicemen of the State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection. Two of them - posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to our defenders! And finally. Tomorrow, April 2, Ukrainian Muslims together with all Muslims of the world will celebrate the holy month of Ramadan. Sincere prayers, mutual forgiveness and good deeds characterize this month. But in Ukraine, another virtue is added - loyalty to brothers-in-arms and your people in battles. In the battles for the freedom of Ukraine. In our war for independence. In which we will definitely win. We will definitely achieve peace. For our entire land. I sincerely wish you peace! Everyone. The whole of Ukraine! All the people of the world. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Strong people of the indomitable country! Another day of our defense has passed. Another day of many that are gradually, with difficulties, but steadily bringing us closer to peace. To peace that no one will give us a gift. We need to understand it clearly. Because there are no subjects in the world that can stop wars and give peace. The global security architecture has failed. Peace for us will not be the result of any decisions of the enemy somewhere in Moscow as well. We should not cherish empty hopes that they will simply leave our land. We can only gain peace. We can gain it in hard battles and in parallel - in negotiations, and in parallel - in daily vigorous work. Therefore, each of us must continue to do everything we can. In all directions. To support our Armed Forces. To preserve and develop economic activity in Ukraine - as much as possible now. To support all our citizens... Wherever they are, whoever they are. In peacetime warm words sustained the vital forces. And in wartime it is even more important. When we may not even know what a person is going through. What a loss. What help a person needs. But we can see that a person needs help. We need to support this person. We should at least hear this person. Say a few kind words. Something needs to be done to support the life of this person. This must be done. You should be attentive to everyone around you! When people defend themselves in a war of annihilation, when there is a question of the lives or deaths of millions, there are no unimportant things. There are no unimportant moments. Everything matters. And everyone can contribute to the victory of all. Someone with a weapon in their hands. Someone - at work. And someone - with a warm word and help at the right time. So do everything you can for us to withstand together in this war for our freedom, for our independence. For Ukraine to live. Due to such sincere and constant support of each other, due to unity and attention to the neighbor, the people can overcome the most difficult challenges. And drive out the enemy, which is many times bigger in numbers. Our defenders continue to regain control over communities in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. There are more and more Ukrainian national flags in the areas that have been temporarily occupied. The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not release the invaders without a fight. Inflict fire damage. They are destroying everyone we can reach. We are strengthening our defenses in the eastern direction and in Donbas. We are aware that the enemy has reserves to increase pressure in the east. What is the goal of Russian troops? They want to capture both Donbas and the south of Ukraine. What is our goal? Protect us, our freedom, our land and our people. Do everything for protection. Our heroic Mariupol continues to hold back a significant part of the enemy forces. Thanks to this resistance, thanks to the courage and resilience of our other cities, Ukraine has gained invaluable time. The time that allows us to undermine the enemy's tactics and weaken their capabilities. Unfortunately, Ukraine has not yet received enough modern Western anti-missile systems. Has not received aircraft. Hasn’t received what the partners could provide. Could - and still can! Every Russian missile that hit our cities and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended. Decision whether to help Ukraine with modern weapons. I would like to thank the residents of our Enerhodar separately. Those brave Ukrainians who went to a rally today to defend their city. To protect our state. In response, the occupiers opened fire and used grenades against completely peaceful people, which are on their land, within their law. There will be an answer for each wounded person. And the Ukrainian character cannot be conquered by any pressure or violence. I am grateful to everyone who takes to the streets in the temporarily occupied cities. To all who are not afraid and go out. I am grateful to all who are afraid and come out. To all those who feel that without this decision to defend Ukraine and their freedom, the occupiers can gain a foothold. And when people protest - and the more people protest - the harder it is for the occupiers to destroy us, to destroy our freedom. This is our common struggle! And it will be our common victory. I would also like to say a few words to those politicians, some deputies of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine who absolutely do not understand what is happening in the hearts of our people. They don't understand it so much that they even decided to change the national anthem. I have a question for these people: what have you done in your life to give you the moral right to change the words of the anthem? Are you outstanding poets? Maybe you excelled in the battles for Ukraine? Or now is such a time that you can change the anthem whenever you want? Cool down emotions. Stop pretending to be fools. I believe that the authors of these and other similar bills, proposals, should take up arms and go to the battlefield, if you have these opportunities. Only there will you understand something. And even if they accidentally vote for something like this, I still will not sign such bills. Don't waste time. I want to turn to another person who does not seem to fully understand what is happening. Not only in Ukraine, but throughout Europe. To the Prime Minister of Hungary. He is virtually the only one in Europe to openly support Mr. Putin. We did not ask for anything special from official Budapest. We didn't even get what everyone else is doing! Doing for the sake of peace. We did not receive the vital transit of defense aid, we did not see moral leadership. We saw no effort to stop the war! Why so? The whole of Europe wants peace. The whole of Europe does not want the battlefield to be moved from Mariupol to Budapest or from Kharkiv to Krakow or from Chernihiv to Vilnius. The whole of Europe is trying to stop the war, to restore peace. Then why is official Budapest opposed to the whole of Europe, to all civilized countries? For what? The main thing for us is the opinion of the people. The Ukrainian people support the Hungarian people. The Hungarian people support the Ukrainian people. We value peace equally, we value freedom equally. It will always be so. We will always live in good neighborliness. And I am convinced that our minorities should be the bridges that unite us even more. Politicians come and go. And the truth remains. That's what I'm talking about - the truth. And I always say what I think. When I am speaking of Hungary, I mean Hungary. And I don't need to mask my thoughts. If we need to speak of Germany, we are speaking of Germany. If I need to speak of another country, I'm speaking of another country. If it's a war, then I call it a war, not a \"special operation.\" If this is a threat to the whole of Europe, then I call it a threat to the whole of Europe. This is called the honesty that Mr. Orban lacks. He may have lost it somewhere in his contacts with Moscow. I spoke today with the President of Colombia. I am very grateful to him for his support and solidarity with Ukraine. The list of countries that honestly say that freedom matters and the war must stop is expanding. I also spoke with British Prime Minister Johnson. A meaningful, pleasant conversation. We agreed on new defensive support for Ukraine. New package. Very, very tangible support. We also agree on the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Extremely tangible. Agreed on joint steps to achieve peace. Thank you Boris for the leadership! Historical leadership. I'm sure of it. In the afternoon I held a large meeting with the economic bloc of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Office of the President. The economic frontline is another direction of our struggle for our state, for our people. We discussed in great detail the situation with sowing, with the supply of food to Ukrainians, with the supply of fuel, the situation in the energy sector, the situation with the main sectors of the state. The Minister of Finance reported on the state of implementation of the state budget, details of negotiations with partners on financial support for Ukraine. In wartime, economic relations must remain one hundred percent managed, no matter how difficult it may be for all of us. Because it's about perspective. About the perspective of life for more than 40 million Ukrainians, about what our tomorrow will be like. The participants of the meeting received clear tasks. And finally. Already traditional. I signed a decree on state awards to our heroes - the heroes of our state. 131 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, nine of them - posthumously. Eternal glory to them all! Eternal glory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our defenders! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Today this address will be without greetings. I do not want any extra words. Presidents do not usually record addresses like this. But today I have to say just that. After what was revealed in Bucha and our other cities the occupiers were expelled from. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, executed civilians. Corpses on the streets. Mined area. Even the bodies of the dead were mined! The pervasive consequences of looting. Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers. Torturers. Rapists. Looters. Who call themselves the army. And who deserve only death after what they did. I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians in an ordinary peaceful city tortured to death? Why were women strangled after their earrings were ripped out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? How could their corpses be desecrated even after death? Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible? Russian mothers! Even if you raised looters, how did they also become butchers? You couldn't be unaware of what's inside your children. You couldn't overlook that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure. I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfillment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people. This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image. Your culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women to whom you came. I approved a decision to create a special mechanism of justice in Ukraine for the investigation and judicial examination of every crime of the occupiers on the territory of our state. The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Office of the Prosecutor General, the National Police, the Security Service, the Intelligence Service and other structures within their competence must make every effort to ensure that the mechanism is operational immediately. I call on all our citizens and friends of Ukraine in the world who can join this work and help establish justice to do so. The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth. Everyone guilty of such crimes will be included in a special Book of Torturers, will be found and punished. Ukrainians! I want you to realize that. We drove the enemy out of several regions. But Russian troops still control the occupied areas of other regions. And after the expulsion of the occupiers, even worse things can be found there. Even more deaths and tortures. Because this is the nature of the Russian military who came to our land. These are bastards who can't do otherwise. And they had such orders. All partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday. There will definitely be a new package of sanctions against Russia. But I'm sure that's not enough. More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land. Today is the fourteenth anniversary of the NATO summit in Bucharest. Then there was a chance to take Ukraine out of the \"gray zone\" in Eastern Europe. Out of the \"gray zone\" between NATO and Russia. Out of the gray zone, in which Moscow thinks they are allowed everything. Even the most dreadful war crimes. Under optimistic diplomatic statements that Ukraine could become a member of NATO, then, in 2008, refusal to accept Ukraine into the Alliance was hidden. The absurd fear of some politicians towards Russia was hidden. They thought that by refusing Ukraine, they would be able to appease Russia, to convince it to respect Ukraine and live normally next to us. During the 14 years since that miscalculation, Ukraine has experienced a revolution and eight years of war in Donbas. And now we are fighting for life in the most horrific war in Europe since World War II. I invite Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see what the policy of concessions to Russia has led to in 14 years. To see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women. I want to be understood correctly. We do not blame the West. We do not blame anyone but the specific Russian military who did this against our people. And those who gave them orders. But we have the right to talk about indecision. About the path to such Bucha, to such Hostomel, to such Kharkiv, to such Mariupol. We have no indecision. No matter whether we are in a certain bloc or non-aligned, we understand one thing: we must be strong. Fourteen years ago, Russia's leader in Bucharest told Western leaders that there was no country like Ukraine. And we prove that there is such a country. It was and it will be. We will not hide behind the strong of this world. We will not beg anyone. Honestly, we shouldn’t have asked for help with weapons to protect ourselves from this evil that came to our land. All the necessary weapons should have been given to us anyway - without requests. Because they themselves realized what evil had come and what it had brought with it. We see what’s at stake in this war. We see what we are defending. There are standards of the Ukrainian army - moral and professional. And it is not our army that has to adjust now. These are many other armies that should learn from our military. And there are standards of the Ukrainian people. And there are standards of the Russian occupiers. This is good and evil. This is Europe and a black hole that wants to tear it all apart and absorb. We will win this war. Even if individual politicians are still unable to overcome the indecision they will pass on to their successors together with their offices. And all the necessary services are already working in Bucha to bring the city back to life. Restore electricity supply, water supply. Restore the work of medical institutions. Rebuild the infrastructure. Give security to people. Because Russia was expelled. And Ukraine is returning. And brings life back. Today I visited our border guards, our heroes in the hospital of the Border Guard Service of Ukraine. Wounded warriors. I presented state awards to the eight of them. I also awarded the orthopedist-traumatologist - medical service officer who is a leading military traumatologist in Ukraine and has already saved many Ukrainian defenders. In total, 41 border guards received state awards under this decree. It was the servicemen of the State Border Guard Service who first met the occupiers with fire when they went on the offensive on February 24. Now our boys and girls are returning to the state border as we expel the occupiers. I am sure the time will come and the whole line of the state border of Ukraine will be restored. And for this to happen sooner, we must all be focused, ready to boldly face evil and respond to every criminal act against Ukraine, against our people, against our freedom. Evil will be punished. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President of the Chamber of Deputies! Dear Mr. President of the Senate! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Ladies and gentlemen, deputies and senators, guests! Dear friends! Romanian people! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and all your people. A few hours ago I returned from the liberated cities of the Kyiv region - near our capital. It is these territories from which we expelled the Russian occupiers and saw what they had been doing to the Ukrainian people on our land. And I want you to see it now. What the occupiers left behind. I apologize - the video is brutal, but it's a reality... The name of our city of Bucha is now forever in world history. In the history of war crimes. In the history of the extermination of people. As of now, we know about more than 300 civilians tortured, executed or otherwise killed in Bucha. Ordinary residents of an ordinary city near Kyiv. Their hands were tied behind their backs, they were shot in the back of the head or in the eye, killed just in the streets. Civilian vehicles were crushed by military equipment. Vehicles with people! They raped women and girls... And this is just the beginning of the investigation. Not all evidence has been collected yet. Not all burials have been discovered yet. Not all basements where the Russian military tortured people have been inspected yet. There is every reason to believe that the number of killed residents of Bucha and other Ukrainian cities nearby will be much higher than what we know today. Why did the Russian military do that? On the same day, April 3, when the world was horrified to see the bodies of those killed in Bucha, an article justifying the genocide of Ukrainians was published on the website of the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Its name is quite eloquent, I quote: \"What should Russia do with Ukraine\". And it's not just text. This is one of the proofs for the future tribunal against Russian war criminals. The article describes a clear and calculated procedure for the destruction of everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians and our people themselves. Those whom they will not be able to break and conquer. It is said that \"de-Ukrainization\" and \"de-Europeanization\" of Ukraine should be carried out. It is said that even the name of our state should be erased. Virtually, it is said that the deaths of as many of our people in the war are only welcomed. I want to emphasize once again: this is the website of the state news agency of Russia, where, under conditions of explicit state censorship, only materials that correspond to the official ideological position on the war against Ukraine can be published. What does not correspond to such a position would simply not pass censorship. I want you to understand me: they are not even hiding. They openly speak about the purpose of the invasion of Ukraine. If our army had not withstood, if our people had not risen to the defense of the state, they would have done what they did in Bucha - but throughout Ukraine. We know about the deliberate killings of teachers and educators in the temporarily occupied territories. We know about deliberate terror against all those whom the occupiers considered as activists, as people related to the army. Even the mere presence of the national symbols of Ukraine, the state flag or coat of arms, in a person's apartment was already a reason for the occupiers to kill this person or at least threaten to kill him or her. But why aren't they hiding? Why do they even now, when everything is clear to the world, openly say how they want to destroy the whole nation? There are two answers to this question. You will understand the first answer very well. In 1989, Nicolae Ceaușescu finally ended his life. For many years it has been clear that this man had lost his adequacy. It has been clear that he, his wife, his entourage, his \"Securitate\" have been dragging your country and people down - to suffering, to poverty, to isolation not just from the world, but from everything advanced in the world. That regime relied only on intimidation, repression, brutality and deception. There was nothing bright in it. The Romanian people revolted and defended themselves, saved themselves. Having overthrown inadequate power. Because that was the only way. Ceaușescu, his wife, his entourage, his \"Securitate\" could not be convinced of anything. It is also impossible to convince those who promote war in Russia now. Who give criminal orders. Who develop plans for the genocide of the Ukrainian people and the destruction of the Ukrainian state. These people are inadequate. They have lost all connection with reality and are willing to sacrifice millions of lives to realize their crazy ideas. And the second reason why Russia is openly calling for genocide and why the crimes of the occupiers that everyone in the world saw in Bucha are possible is the belief of Russia's top officials that European leaders will fail, will be weak. That Europe will lack leadership. And that the nations of Europe are incapable of defending the values that have united the continent. Ladies and Gentlemen! Great Romanian people! Together we must stop these inadequate people who are accustomed to impunity and therefore decided that they are allowed absolutely everything. Together we must stop those who want genocide in Europe. Why must we do this together? Each of you understands that Ukraine is not the last target of Russian aggression. Troops of occupiers are stubbornly trying to bypass our city of Mykolaiv to try to seize Odesa. And from Odesa there is one step to Moldova. Russian state propagandists have long said that Moldova is also a target for Russian expansion. Therefore, the defense of Ukrainians of their own state is a fundamental prerequisite for security and independence of Moldova. And therefore a prerequisite for peace in the whole large region of the Danube. Now the fate of the whole of Eastern and Central Europe and the Black Sea region is being decided on the territory of Ukraine. Therefore, to protect the freedom of Ukraine, to protect the freedom of Ukrainians is to guarantee the security of Europe. What must be done? Yes, it is true, sanctions were imposed on Russia for this war. But the war for our freedom has been going on for 40 days already. After 8 years of war in Donbas. Therefore, sanctions are not enough. Russia must seek peace with Ukraine and with the whole of Europe. To this end, Russia must be deprived of all resources. First of all, financial and economic ones. The European Union must finally adopt a principled decision and close ports to Russian ships. Stop the transit of goods and any economic activity with Russia. Restricting the flow of money for Russian energy has no alternative. One can argue about what the format should be: a full embargo on supplies or a program like \"Oil-for-Food\" - but it is necessary. And not only that. Every politician in a democratic world must defend the need to provide Ukraine with all the necessary weapons. Because it is on the battlefield that it is decided who will be the winner in this war - freedom or tyranny. Everyone on whom it depends must do everything possible to quickly and inevitably bring to justice all Russian servicemen and their commanders guilty of committing crimes against civilians in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Today, I reached an agreement with the European Union on the provision of financial and technical support to the Eurojust Joint Investigation Team, EU member states and the International Criminal Court. I believe that Romania's leadership will be one of the decisive factors in restoring justice and protecting normal life both in our region and in Europe as a whole. I am confident that Romania and Romanian companies will also take part in Ukraine's post-war reconstruction program. We invite our partners in Europe to take patronage over a city, region or industry that has suffered from Russia's aggression. Your potential, your inner strength can create a new example of leadership in building a civilized and peaceful life. I am sincerely grateful to all the Romanian people for their kind treatment of Ukrainian immigrants who have found safety on your land. I hope that together we will be able to create such conditions as soon as possible, when Russia will give up the war, and so our people will be able to return home to Ukraine. And this experience of assistance in emergency situations, mutual respect, kindness between our people has already become the basis for even greater rapprochement of our states, our nations. As soon as the situation allows, I want to start a dialogue with you on a new comprehensive agreement that guarantees the absolute protection and development of our national minorities - the Ukrainian community in Romania and the Romanian community in Ukraine. Because our destiny is to be as close as we can. Our destiny is to be defenders of freedom in our region. Our destiny is to be together in the European family. And I believe that very soon I will be able to address you with words of gratitude for Romania's support for Ukraine's accession to the European Union. Thank you very much! Glory to Romania! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today has been a really difficult day. Emotional. I’ve visited our cities in the Kyiv region, which we liberated from the occupiers. Stoyanka, Irpin, Bucha. Of course, now this area does not look like yesterday. The bodies of killed people, killed Ukrainians have already been taken from most streets. But in the yards, in the houses, the dead still remain. The cities are simply ruined. Burnt military equipment on the roads, destroyed cars. It is especially hard to look at the traces of bullets on cars with the inscription \"Children\". We have just begun an investigation into all that the occupiers have done. At present, there is information about more than three hundred people killed and tortured in Bucha alone. It is likely that the list of victims will be much larger when the whole city is checked. And this is only one city. One of the many Ukrainian communities that the Russian military managed to seize. There is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities. In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago. The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this. We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible. Everything to punish them. This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court. I discussed this issue today with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. And also with Chancellor of Austria Nehammer. We agreed on his visit to Ukraine in the near future. I also discussed the investigation into the war crimes of Russian troops with Polish President Duda. We also talked about new sanctions against Russia, humanitarian and defense cooperation with Poland. All crimes of the occupiers are documented. The necessary procedural basis is provided for bringing the guilty Russian military to justice for every crime they commit. I would like to emphasize that we are interested in the most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which will be known and explained to the entire international community. We provide maximum access for journalists to Bucha and other liberated cities of Ukraine. For hundreds of journalists from around the world. And we are interested in having thousands of journalists there. As many as possible! For the world to see what Russia has done. I'm sure you know about the new old tactics of Russian propagandists who are constantly trying to reject accusations of the Russian military. Why the new old? Everything is simple. Because they used the same tactics when the occupiers shot down a Malaysian Boeing over Donbas. They blamed Ukraine. They even came up with various conspiracy theories. They even went so far as to claim that the corpses were \"thrown\" on board the plane before it crashed. Now they are doing the same thing. The same lies. They are trying to distort the facts. But, as then, they will not succeed. They will not be able to deceive the whole world. The time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who of their fellow citizens killed. Who gave orders. Who turned a blind eye to the murders. We will establish all this. And make it globally known. It is now 2022. And we have much more tools than those who prosecuted the Nazis after World War II. We must also be aware that after the revealed mass killings of civilians in the Kyiv region, the occupiers may have a different attitude to their crimes in another part of our country where they came. They are already launching a false campaign to conceal their guilt in the mass killings of civilians in Mariupol. They will do dozens of stage interviews, re-edited recordings, and will kill people specifically to make it look like they were killed by someone else. Probably, now the occupiers will try to hide the traces of their crimes. They did not do this in Bucha when they retreated. But in another area it is possible. I want to say right away: every normal person in the world understands who brought war and mass deaths to Ukrainian land. There is ample evidence that it is Russian troops who destroy peaceful cities, abduct, torture, kill civilians. Therefore, Russian propagandists and their leaders can now succeed in only one thing: making their work enough for the verdict of the future tribunal, which will be similar to the verdict of Julius Streicher, one of the ideologues of Nazism, editor-in-chief of the Der Stürmer weekly. He was executed for anti-Semitic propaganda and calls for genocide. Nowadays people are not executed already. But all skabeevas, evening loudmouths, frontline liars and their bosses in Moscow should remember: the end of your life will be behind bars. At best. I would also like to note the reaction of the leaders of the democratic world to what they saw in Bucha. The sanctions response to Russia’s massacre of civilians must finally be powerful. But was it really necessary to wait for this to reject doubts and indecision? Did hundreds of our people really have to die in agony for some European leaders to finally understand that the Russian state deserves the most severe pressure? This breaks the heart of every Ukrainian. It breaks my heart. Because only now do we hear from all world leaders statements that should have been made long ago, when everything was already completely clear. I emphasize once again: Ukraine must get all the necessary weapons to drive the occupiers out of our land as soon as possible, to liberate our cities. And if we had already got what we needed - all these planes, tanks, artillery, anti-missile and anti-ship weapons, we could have saved thousands of people. I do not blame you - I blame only the Russian military. But you could have helped. I will continue to say this to the face of all those on whom the decision on weapons for Ukraine depends. We have already started preparing all the necessary work to restore normal life in the liberated areas. Mine clearance of the territory is carried out. Our sappers neutralize thousands of explosive devices every day! In the near future we will restore electricity supply, restore water supply to this whole territory of our state. We will provide medical care, normal access to goods - as much as possible in the current conditions. Of course, we will rebuild the destroyed and damaged housing. We will rebuild roads, bridges, infrastructure. Life will come again to every city, to every community that the occupiers tried to destroy. This week I continue to address the parliaments of the nations of the world. Today was Romania. I thanked the Romanian people for their warm attitude towards our migrants. It's true. I called for greater sanctions against Russia. I also said that Romania's leadership was indispensable for ensuring security in the Black Sea region and for restoring justice in Europe as a whole. Tomorrow I will address the Spanish Parliament. And also the UN Security Council. Today I expressed condolences to the President of the Republic of Lithuania and to the entire Lithuanian people over the brutal murder of the world-famous documentary filmmaker Mantas Kvedaravičius by the Russian occupiers in Mariupol. In 2016, he made a film about our peaceful Mariupol, which shortly before found itself on the frontline of the war in Donbas. And now it was there that his life was taken. May the memory of him live forever! We continue to prepare for even more brutal activity of the occupiers in the eastern and southern directions. We know what they are going to do in Donbas. We know what they are going to do near Kharkiv, in some other parts of the country. Russia concentrates a significant amount of military and equipment there. And this activity proves that sanctions imposed against Russia are not enough. There will be more. If the Russian leadership does not begin to really seek peace, really negotiate peace, they will put their country in the worst condition in 50 years. The so-called wicked 90's will seem prosperous and calm. And traditionally, before delivering this address, I signed a decree awarding our Ukrainian heroes. 152 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine received state awards, three of them posthumously. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to everyone who perished for our country! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mrs. President! Dear Mr. Secretary General! Dear members of the Security Council and other participants of the meeting! Thank you for the opportunity. I am sure that all the representatives of the UN member states will hear me today. Yesterday I returned from our city of Bucha, recently liberated from the troops of the Russian Federation. It is difficult to find a war crime that the occupiers have not committed there. The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our state. They executed women outside the houses when approaching and simply calling someone alive. They killed whole families - adults and children. And they tried to burn their bodies. I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased everyday. Everyday, in the morning. The memory of the killed civilians. Who were shot in the back of the head or in the eye after being tortured. Who were shot just on the streets. Who were thrown into the well, so that they die there in suffering. Who were killed in apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Who were crushed by tanks in civilian cars in the middle of the road. For fun. Whose limbs were cut off, whose throat was cut. Who were raped and killed in front of their own children. Their tongues were torn out only because they did not hear from them what they wanted to hear. How is this different from what the ISIS terrorists were doing in the occupied territory? Except that it is done by a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It destroys the internal unity of states. Destroys state borders. Denies the right of more than a dozen peoples on two continents to self-determination and independent state life. Pursues a consistent policy of destroying ethnic and religious diversity. Inflames wars and deliberately wages them in such a way as to kill as many ordinary civilians as possible. To destroy as many ordinary peaceful cities as possible. To leave in the country where it sends its troops only ruins and mass graves. You've seen it all. Promotes hatred at the state level and seeks to export it to other countries through its system of propaganda and political corruption. Provokes a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa and Asia, and will certainly end in large-scale political chaos in countries where food price stability is a key factor of domestic security. So where is the security that the Security Council must guarantee? There is no security. Although there is a Security Council, as if nothing happened. So where is the peace that the United Nations was created to guarantee? It is obvious that the key institution of the world, which must ensure the coercion of any aggressors to peace, simply cannot work effectively. Now the world has seen what the Russian military did in Bucha while keeping our city under occupation. But the world has yet to see what they have done in other occupied cities, in other occupied areas of our country. Geography may be different, but cruelty is the same. Crimes are the same. And responsibility must be inevitable. Ladies and Gentlemen! I would like to remind you of the first article of the first chapter of the UN Charter. What is the purpose of our organization? To maintain peace. And to force to peace. Now the UN Charter is being violated literally from the first article. And if so, what is the point of all other articles? Today, it is as a result of Russia's actions on the territory of my state, on the territory of Ukraine, that the most heinous war crimes of all time since the end of World War II are being committed. Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation in them. They are deliberately shooting at columns of civilians on the roads who are trying to escape from the territory of hostilities. They are even deliberately blowing up shelters where civilians are hiding from air strikes. They are deliberately creating conditions in the temporarily occupied territories so that as many civilians as possible are killed there. The massacre in our city of Bucha is just one, unfortunately, of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for 41 days. And there are many other such places that the world has yet to find out the full truth of: Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Borodyanka and dozens of other Ukrainian communities, each of which is like Bucha. I know, and you know very well, what the representatives of Russia will say in response to the accusations of these crimes. They have said this many times. The most illustrative was after the downing of a Malaysian Boeing over Donbas by Russian forces with Russian weapons. Or during the war in Syria. They will blame everyone, just to justify themselves. They will say that there are different versions, and which of them is true is allegedly impossible to establish yet. They will even say that the bodies of those killed were allegedly “planted”, and all the videos are staged. But. Now is the year 2022. There is conclusive evidence. There are satellite images. It is possible to conduct a full, transparent investigation. That is what we are interested in. Maximum access of journalists. Maximum cooperation with international institutions. Involvement of the International Criminal Court. Full truth, full responsibility. I am sure that every state in the UN system should be interested in this. For what? In order to punish once and for all those who consider themselves privileged, consider themselves unpunished. Hence, to show all other potential war criminals in the world that they will inevitably be punished as well. If the biggest is punished, everyone will be punished.  Why did Russia come to Ukraine, tell me? I will answer. Russia's leadership feels like colonizers - as in ancient times. They need our wealth and our people. Russia has already deported tens of thousands of our citizens to its territory. Then there will be hundreds. It abducted more than two thousand children. Simply abducted thousands of children. And continues to do so. Russia wants to turn Ukrainians into silent slaves. The Russian militaries are openly looting the cities and villages they have captured. This is looting of the highest scale. They steal everything from food to gold earrings they just rip out with blood. We are dealing with a state that turns the right of veto in the UN Security Council into a right to kill. Which undermines the whole architecture of global security. Which allows evil to go unpunished and spread the world. Destroying everything that can work for peace and security. If this continues, the finale will be that each state will rely only on the power of arms to ensure its security, not on international law, not on international institutions. Then, the UN can simply be dissolved. Ladies and Gentlemen! Are you ready for the dissolving of the UN? Do you think that the time of international law has passed? If your answer is no, you need to act now, act immediately. The power of the UN Charter must be restored immediately. The UN system must be reformed immediately so that the right of veto is not a right to kill. So that there is a fair representation of all regions of the world in the Security Council. The aggressor must be forced to peace immediately. Determination is needed. The chain of mass killings from Syria to Somalia, from Afghanistan to Yemen and Libya should have been stopped a long time ago to be honest. If tyranny had ever received such a response to the war it had unleashed that it would have ceased to exist and a fair peace would have been guaranteed after it, the world would have changed for sure. And then, perhaps, we would not have a war, a war in my country. Against our nation, the Ukrainian nation. Against people. But the world watched and did not want to see the occupation of Crimea, or even before - the war against Georgia, or even earlier - the alienation from Moldova of the entire Transnistrian region. It also didn’t want to see how Russia was preparing the ground for other conflicts and wars near its borders. How to stop it? Immediately bring the Russian military and those who gave them orders to justice for war crimes in Ukraine. Everyone who gave criminal orders and fulfilled them by killing people will face a tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials. I want to remind Russian diplomats that a man like von Ribbentrop has not avoided punishment after World War II. And I also want to remind the architects of Russia's criminal policy that punishment has reached Adolf Eichmann as well. None of the culprits will escape. No one. But the main thing is that today is the time to transform the system, the core of which is the United Nations. To do this, we propose to convene a global conference. And we ask to do it already in peaceful Kyiv - in order to decide. How we will reform the world security system. How we will really guarantee the inviolability of universally recognized borders and the integrity of states. How we will ensure the rule of international law. It is now clear that the goals set in San Francisco in 1945 during the creation of a global international security organization have not been achieved. And it is impossible to achieve them without reforms. Therefore, we must do everything in our power to pass on to the next generations an effective UN with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and thus guarantee peace. Prevent aggression and force aggressors to peace. Have the determination and ability to punish if the principles of peace are violated. There can be no more exceptions, privileges. Everyone must be equal. All participants in international relations. Regardless of economic strength, geographical area and individual ambitions. The power of peace must become dominant. The power of justice and the power of security. As humanity has always dreamed of. Ukraine is ready to provide a platform for one of the main offices of the updated security system. Just as the Geneva office specializes in human rights, just as the Nairobi office specializes in the field of environmental protection, the Kyiv U-24 Office can specialize in preventive measures to maintain peace. I want to remind you of our peaceful mission in Afghanistan. When, at our own expense, we Ukrainians evacuated more than a thousand people from this country. And it was the hottest phase. But people needed help - and Ukraine came. Just like other states. We evacuated people of different nationalities, different faiths. Afghans, citizens of European countries, USA, Canada. We did not distinguish who needs help, whether these are our people or not. We saved everyone. If every time there was a need everyone in the world was confident that help would come, the world would be definitely safer. Therefore, Ukraine has the necessary moral right to propose a reform of the world security system. We have proven that we help others not only in good times, but also in dark times. And now we need decisions from the Security Council. For peace in Ukraine. If you do not know how to adopt this decision, you can do two things. Remove Russia as an aggressor and a source of war from blocking decisions about its own aggression, its own war. And then do everything that can establish peace. Or show how you can reformat and really work for peace. Or if your current format is unalterable and there is simply no way out, then the only option would be to dissolve yourself altogether. I am convinced that you can do without the third option. Ukraine needs peace. We need peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace. And finally, I’m asking you to watch the video. A short one. A video of what has come to replace your power because someone alone can abuse his rights. This is what impunity leads to. If possible - watch this video. Because there is no opportunity for everyone to come to us and see it. So watch it. Thank you."

  "speech": "Dear Mrs. President of the Congress of Deputies! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies and senators! Dear members of the Government! Dear people of Spain! Thank you for this opportunity, with great respect from all the Ukrainian people to you. I am addressing you with the hope that you will understand most of all our pain from the war and our hope for peace. Because for us in Ukraine now absolutely everything that is the basis of public life for you is under threat. We are one of the largest countries in Europe. And one of the most variegated. But united by democracy and respect for every person, for every community. I want to give you just one example of our state, of our lives. We have the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations. Different denominations, different views on public life and relations between the state and the Church are always agreed peacefully and with respect for others in the format of this Council. This is just one example, but it shows that we, Ukrainians, are committed to peace and a conflict-free environment even in such sensitive issues that in many other societies always cause controversy and conflict. Russia came to our land with the war not yesterday and not the day before yesterday. It's been a long time. We have been protecting our country from brutal, unprovoked aggression since 2014. First - the occupation of our Crimea. Then - the war in the Ukrainian Donbas. Now - already 41 days of full-scale invasion. The worst war in Europe since World War II. But why did Russia come to us, to our home, to Ukraine? What exactly must Russian weapons destroy? Not just our people. Not just any basis for a peaceful life. But also the opportunity to live without a dictatorship. Opportunity to live without state violence. Opportunity to be a sustainable open democracy. Opportunity of peaceful coexistence of different religions, different communities. The format of Russian state life does not provide for everything that is absolutely familiar to us, to Ukraine. Russia wants to make sure that only one order dominates in our entire region - tyrannical. So that any diversity is destroyed. So that it is impossible to find common ground and compromises between different communities. This is exactly what is happening in Russia now. This is exactly what it wants to establish in Ukraine. And then in the whole region of Eastern and Central Europe. And what will happen next? I know that for your country, for Spain, it is important for a democratic system to be protected. For peace on the European continent to be guaranteed. But how can this be possible now? After Russia began to allocate all its state resources to the spread of war and the destruction of any basis of normal life. Just imagine this - mothers in Ukraine write on the backs of their young children the child's name, phone numbers of relatives with the usual pen... Why? Because if the occupiers kill their parents, there will be at least a small chance that someone will save these children. Imagine that people now - in Europe - live for weeks in basements to save lives. From shelling, from air bombs. Daily! 2022, April - and the reality in Ukraine is as if it’s April 1937. When the whole world learned the name of one of your cities - Guernica. Imagine that in ordinary cities, conditions can be artificially created where more than a hundred thousand people live for weeks without water, without food, without medicine. Russian troops blocked our city of Mariupol more than three weeks ago. They are destroying this city completely - there is already nothing there but ruins. More than 90 percent of all buildings were destroyed! The killed people were buried in the yards near the destroyed high-rise buildings where they lived... Russian aircraft bombed even those buildings in Mariupol where they knew exactly people were hiding. Children were hiding... Ukraine speaks about it every day. Every day throughout the days of this invasion. But the war continues. Russia is not serious about peace. What is even worse is that we still do not know how much longer the war will last until the world finally does everything necessary for peace. Really powerful sanctions are needed. The most powerful. How can we allow Russian banks to generate profits while the Russian military tortures ordinary civilians to death in Ukrainian cities? How can European companies trade in a state that is deliberately destroying our people? I know that many of your companies have already stopped financing the Russian military machine through taxes. I want to thank you, your citizens, and your government. I am grateful to these companies, to your entire state and society for the principled stance on sanctions. But at the same time, I want to turn to some companies, such as Maxam, Porcelanosa, Sercobe and other companies - I think you know them better than I do - to stop doing business with Russia. What our city of Bucha, our city of Borodyanka, our other cities have experienced are war crimes. Crimes against humanity. Without statute of limitations. This is an absolutely clear basis for the Russian military and commanders to be convicted by an international court. In these conditions, how can the countries of the world freely buy Russian oil and allow Russian ships into their ports? Ladies and Gentlemen! Spanish people! Now the fate of not only our state is being decided on the territory of Ukraine. But also the fate of the whole European project, of the values that united us all. Us with you. Of democracy that united us all. Of human rights, which have become a fundamental value for all of us. I am grateful to your country for supporting common European decisions for peace. But all of us in Europe, all of us in the world need to do even more to force Russia to seek peace. So that Russia finally starts to respect international law. What is needed for this? Everyone in Europe must simply stop being afraid. Stop being weak. They have to become strong. Put values and democracy above the threats that Russia spreads. I am sure fear is not about you. But I ask you to do everything so that other European countries do not have fear as well. You can help us. Help the world. Give us the weapons we need. And we appreciate that help, that weaponry - all that you have already given us. You can support further sanctions that are needed. And you can also destroy the fear of Russia wherever you can see it. Because democracy should not fear. Freedom must be protected. Human rights must be above all calculations. The right to peace. The right to life. The right to happiness, to free development. The right to family security. The right to the future of children. The right to a decent old age of parents. The right to respect for every community. The right to be with you, Spain, together in a European family. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today I will not take away much of your attention. The day was very informative. I will only briefly walk through the main points of my work this Tuesday, the 41st day of the invasion of the Russian Federation. I continued my active diplomatic work. Addressed the UN Security Council, which convened for a special meeting on Russia's war crimes in Bucha and in the occupied territories of Ukraine in general. I said what should have been said in this format a long time ago. The UN Security Council exists, and security in the world doesn’t. For anyone. This definitely means that the United Nations is currently unable to carry out the functions for which it was created. And only one state is to blame for this - Russia, which discredits the UN and all other international institutions where it still participates. Well, not exactly participates... Tries to block everything constructive and use global architecture in order to spread lies and justify the evil it does. I'm sure the world sees it. I hope the world will draw conclusions. Otherwise there will be only one institution left in the world to guarantee the security of states. Namely - weapons. I offered to the members of the UN Security Council and to all other states that respect international law specific things that could change the situation. In particular, a global conference already in peaceful Kyiv to determine how the world's architecture can be reformed given all the actions of Russia, which is still occupying the seat of a permanent member of the UN Security Council received from the Soviet Union. I also addressed the Parliament and the people of Spain. A state that supports our struggle for freedom and for the preservation of democracy in Europe. I also spoke today with President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron about the humanitarian situation in the temporarily occupied regions of Ukraine. About how we can help people in the blocked Mariupol. We also agreed that France would provide the necessary technical and expert support in the investigation of the crimes of the Russian occupiers in Bucha and other cities of our country. We are preparing a new package of powerful sanctions against Russia for everything it has done to our people. Now is a crucial moment, especially for Western leaders. And this is no longer about how our people will evaluate the new sanctions and what I will say about them. This is about how decisions on sanctions will be assessed in Western societies themselves. After what the world saw in Bucha, sanctions against Russia must be commensurate with the gravity of the occupiers' war crimes. If after that Russian banks will still be able to function as usual... If after that the transit of goods to Russia will continue as usual... If after that the EU countries will pay for Russian energy resources as usual... Then the political fate of some leaders will develop not as usual. My advice to everyone: feel now that the moment is really crucial. We are preparing to welcome President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and head of European diplomacy Josep Borrell in Kyiv in the near future. Working together in Kyiv is something that will be praised by many nations of the world. And not only in Europe. Because now Kyiv is the capital of global democracy, the capital of the struggle for freedom for all on the European continent. And I want to thank all our defenders for making this possible. For the fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine hold most of the areas where the enemy tried to break into the country. The most difficult situation, as in previous days, is in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction. But we continue to do everything to ensure that our defenders have something to stop the Russian troops with. We are aware that the occupiers outnumber us. That they have more equipment. We are aware of the attempts by Russian leaders to recruit new fools all over Russia among cadets of military schools, people with combat experience and conscripts to send them all to slaughter in another offensive. But we have no other choice - the fate of our land and our people is being decided. We know what we are fighting for. And we do everything to win. Today in the Mariyinsky Palace I presented the Golden Star Orders to the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine, and to the members of families of those who were posthumously awarded this title. Now it is in the Mariyinsky Palace, in the White Hall, where we always meet foreign heads of state, that such important ceremonies will take place. We will demonstrate every time that our defenders deserve respect and honor at the highest level. And the White Hall of the Mariyinsky Palace will henceforth be called the White Hall of the Heroes of Ukraine. I also handed over the Order of Courage to the family of the deceased documentary photographer Maks Levin who was viciously killed by the occupiers in the Kyiv region. During his life, he made a significant contribution to making us all see and know what is happening in our country. Traditionally, before delivering the evening address, I signed decrees awarding our military. 292 servicemen, 57 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to each of our defenders! Everything for the victory. Everything for peace. Everything for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear speakers! The Taoiseach and members of the government! Dear members of the Oireachtas! Dear people of Ireland! Tonight Russian missiles again struck the territory of our state. Foully hitting the ordinary civilian infrastructure. In particular, the new depot with fuel. One of the dozens that Russia sees as a target. And this has already become the trademark of the occupiers – to destroy everything that helps to arrange ordinary life of ordinary people. They consistently destroy fuel storage sites, product distribution centers, destroy even conventional agricultural machinery, and mine fields. They are constantly sowing mines everywhere. In every place they are leaving. In addition, Russia has blocked all our seaports, along with those vessels that have already been loaded with agricultural goods for export. Why are they doing this? Because they also consider hunger as their weapon. Weapon against us, ordinary people. As a tool to dominate. Ukraine is one of the leading countries in the global food market. Without our exports, it is not simply a shortage, but a threat of famine for more than a dozen countries in Africa and Asia. Because there will be not enough volumes of commodities and prices will hike. It's a fact. It will be harder for millions of the poor in North Africa and parts of Asia to feed their families. Now, it is the time of the planting season in Ukraine. To foil our planting season, to destroy our infrastructure is to deliberately provoke a food crisis. And what will happen due to this crisis? At least, it will be political turbulence. At most, there will be outbreaks of violence in regions where instability is becoming traditional, and a new mass influx of refugees who are simply looking for ways to survive will be seen. Russia has been using hunger against our people since the first days of the war. The worst is in Mariupol. This half-million city was completely blocked by Russian troops more than a month ago. They blocked access from both land and sea. Any access. They are blocking humanitarian goods, do not allow to bring anything – food, water, medicine. When there was snow, people could melt at least the snow to get water, but now there is none. Round-the-clock shelling, air raids, bombing continue... There is not a single building left in Mariupol, not a single undamaged building. In the city with the population of half a million – none. The dead and killed were buried in the yards of destroyed high-rise buildings. When they were able to do it. But in many cases it was not possible to bury. The bodies of people remained in the streets, in the ruins of houses, in collapsed basements. We do not know how many Mariupol residents have been killed by Russia. But we know for sure that this was part of the general tactics of the occupiers. They did the same or tried to do the same with Chernihiv, Sumy, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Izium, Volnovakha and many other Ukrainian cities. You may not have heard all these names yet. But these are millions of people that Russia was simply trying to destroy. And continues to do so. When you hear this, it may seem impossible. It may seem that no one in today's world would dare to do so. But these are real facts. The fact that the residents of Mariupol drew on the sheets of school notebooks how to find where the bodies of their loved ones are buried in the city yards. The fact that the Russian occupiers shot people on the roads as they tried to escape from the blocked cities. Hundreds of cars hit by shelling are still left on Ukrainian highways. The fact that the Russian military did not even try to remove the bodies of killed people from the streets. While Bucha, Irpin and other our cities were under occupation, the corpses were laying just on the roads, on the roadsides, in the yards of houses – anywhere... The fact that at least 167 children have been killed in 42 days of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We do not yet know all the victims of Mariupol. We do not know the victims of other cities, areas where hostilities or occupation continue. The fact that 927 educational institutions and 285 hospitals have been destroyed or damaged in the shelling by Russia. Even 73 ambulances have come under the occupiers' fire! They bombed and shelled even churches... Even shelters, which they knew for sure that there was no one there but women and children... And that's a fact. A state that does this does not deserve to be among others in the international community. Russia does not deserve relations with it as with one of the normal states. It must be responsible for everything it has done on Ukrainian land. The Russian military came to Ukraine as an army of colonizers. Their state propagandists, their politicians don't even hide what they want anymore. In the 21st century, they see their state as a colonial empire that allegedly has the right to subjugate neighboring nations and destroy any basis for their independent living. Destroy even the very identity of nations. Everything that makes us Ukrainians... The Russian military purposefully searched for and killed teachers in the occupied territories. Everyone who was associated with the army. They kidnap local government officials and kill community leaders. Along with the Russian army, units to suppress any political resistance immediately they entered our territory were created... Now, when there are discussions about sanctions against the Russian Federation, I just can't hear any doubts, I can't see any indecision... After everything we have experienced in Ukraine. After all that the Russian troops did. Even now, when the world already knows everything about Russia's war crimes against our people, we have to persuade even some European companies to leave the Russian market. We still have to convince Western politicians in some countries that we need to stop any connection between Russian banks and the global financial system. Unfortunately, we still have to convince Europe that it is impossible that Russian oil provides the Russian military machine with a generous flow of money. Ladies and Gentlemen! Irish people! From the first days of the Russian invasion, you are on the side of good. On the side of freedom. On the side of Ukraine. And this is also a fact. You have no doubt whether to help us. You started doing it right away. And although you are a neutral country, you have not remained neutral to the grief and suffering that Russia has brought to Ukrainians. I am grateful to all of you for that. I am grateful to the leadership of your country, to every Irish man and woman. I am grateful for the support of sanctions against Russia. I am grateful for the humanitarian and financial support provided to us. Thank you for taking special care of our people who have sought and found safety in your land. Just think about it: Russia has already left homeless 10 million Ukrainians who were forced to flee their hometowns because of this war ... It is simply impossible to accept! But let us be aware that Russia has not yet given up on its plans. It is still continuing offensive operations in Ukraine. It is still looking for ways to conquer all our Ukrainian people. We must do everything together so that Russia forced to seek only peace. It seek only way to leave the territory of Ukraine and give us in peace. That is why I urge you to show even more leadership in our anti-war coalition! I urge you to persuade your EU partners to toughen sanctions against the Russian Federation. The sanctions that will really stop Russia's military machine. We need to stop all trade with Russia. Russia's banks' ties with the world's financial system must be blocked. We need to cut off the flow of money that the Russian budget receives for oil and spends it on missiles, bombs, artillery shelling... The world has long developed appropriate mechanisms. Everyone knows what to do. The only obstacle is the lack of principled stance of individual leaders. Yet. Political leaders, business leaders. Those who still think that war and war crimes are not as terrible as financial losses. I'm sure your leadership can change that. I am confident that all of us in Europe together will be able to end this terrible war and restore peace and stability in Eastern Europe. It is simply impossible to procrastinate with this. The longer the Russian aggression lasts, the worse the consequences will be not only for our continent, but also for the neighboring regions of our planet. Ladies and Gentlemen! Irish people! Our common principles, our common fearlessness have already started a new page in the history of relations between Ukraine and Ireland. Our mutual understanding and respect is at the level where we can say: it is only a matter of time before you and we live together in our common European home. I am grateful to you for supporting the special fast-track procedure for granting Ukraine membership in the European Union. With your leadership, it will be even faster and more profitable for both our nations. And now we need to think about the restoration of our country. About recovery after the war. We invite the leading countries of the planet to take part in the reconstruction of Ukraine. Of course, I invite Ireland to take part in this project. I do it with pleasure. For example, in our Kherson region. Your ability to value life and people, your ability to live in communities, your economic potential – they are well-known. So let's join forces and show that Ukraine and Ireland together can do much more than the world's largest state planned to destroy. Grateful to Ireland! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! It seems that the attitude to the modern Russian state is finally changing in the world. After what the world saw in Bucha when Russian troops retreated. Now the attitude to everyone in Russia will be simple: you support either the search for peace or unjustified massacre. Killed Ukrainian men and women in Bucha, in Irpin, in other cities that Russian troops entered is the last argument. The last argument for every citizen of Russia to decide whether you are for war or for peace. If for war, then you will forever - until the end of your life - be outcasts and in the end you will lose everything. And if for peace, if you feel even a little bit of shame for what the Russian troops are doing in Ukraine, then now is a key moment for such citizens of Russia: you have to demand - exactly demand - an end to the war. It is better now, demanding peace, to lose something, to somehow face the Russian repressive machine than to be equated with the Nazis for the rest of your life. This applies not only to any public person in the Russian Federation, not only to businessmen, but also to ordinary citizens. Nazism has no future. Mass killings have no future. Everyone in Russia who will not demand an end to this shameful war and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine has no future. It seems that the Russian leadership is really afraid that the anger of the world because of what they saw in Bucha would be repeated because of what they will see in other cities, from where we will definitely drive out the occupiers. We have information that the Russian troops have changed their tactics and are trying to remove the killed people from the streets and basements of the occupied territory. Killed Ukrainians. This is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more. But they will not succeed, because they killed a lot. Responsibility cannot be avoided. We already know about thousands of missing people. We already know about thousands of people who could be either deported to Russia or killed. There are no other options for their fate. The situation now is that thanks to an objective investigation, thanks to witnesses, thanks to satellite surveillance of events on earth, thanks to other tools that help establish the truth we will find out all the circumstances regarding the majority of our missing citizens. Regarding most of Russia's war crimes in Ukraine. If the world has started a debate about whether it is permissible to call what the Russian military did on the territory of Ukraine genocide, the search for truth can no longer be stopped. You can't roll it back in any way. One can only quickly abandon further aggression against Ukraine and thus try to somehow reduce the damage to Russian statehood and to those who personally adopt key decisions in Russia. If not, if nothing changes, then it is suicide. Suicide for anyone who chooses to continue the war. Today, Western countries announced a new package of sanctions against the Russian Federation. New investments in Russia are blocked, restrictions are applied against several systemic banks in Russia, personal sanctions are added, as well as other restrictions. This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough. Still it can hardly be called commensurate with the evil that the world saw in Bucha. With the evil that continues in Mariupol, in the shelling of Kharkiv, in Russia's attempt to launch a new global bloody offensive in Donbas... We will continue to insist on a complete blockade of the Russian banking system from international finance. We will also continue to insist on one or another format of the democratic world's refusal to buy Russian oil. It is the export of oil that is one of the foundations of Russia's aggression. One of the foundations that allows the Russian leadership not to take seriously the negotiations on ending the war and on the liberation of Ukrainian territory. Some politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of dollars and euros to Russia from the oil trade, so as not to jeopardize their own economies. But that's why people go into politics. To solve such problems, difficult tasks. To solve them quickly and in a principled fashion. If you are not capable, then you shouldn’t have started political activity. The embargo on Russian oil supplies will be applied anyway. The format will be found. The only question is how many more Ukrainian men and women the Russian military will have time to kill, so that you, some politicians - and we know you, can borrow a little determination somewhere. It is good that the United States Department of the Treasury has suspended Russia's ability to use US bank accounts and related assets to pay its debt. It's tangible. And I'm grateful for that. But much more needs to be done to stop the war. If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons we really need and have applied for many times, it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to go further. A permission to attack. A permission to start a new bloody wave in Donbas. It is still possible to prevent this. It is still possible to impose such sanctions, which Ukraine insists on, our people insist on. It is still possible to give us weapons that will really stop this aggression. The West can do it. Just as it could have applied preventive sanctions last year to prevent this invasion. If the mistake is made again, if there is no preventive action again, it will be a historic mistake for the whole Western world. I addressed the parliament and the people of Ireland today. This country was one of the first to come to our aid after February 24. And it is one of those who shows principled leadership in the European house to put effective and decisive pressure on Russia. As a result of my address, we have good news: Ireland fully supports Ukraine's accelerated accession to the European Union. And it will do everything to increase the pressure on Russia as much as necessary to end this war. Tomorrow I will address the parliaments and nations of Greece and the Republic of Cyprus. In the afternoon I held a meeting with members of the Cabinet of Ministers in Kyiv. The key issues are the implementation of the state budget and economic activity in our country. We must do everything possible to restore the work of domestic enterprises, trade activities, and revive small and medium-sized enterprises throughout our territory where it is safe and possible to work. The economy is also a frontline on which we fight for our freedom, for our state, for our people. Therefore, we need to constantly look for ways to adapt to the circumstances. Now we need to be as creative and bold as possible in solving economic issues. It depends not only on government officials and the central government in general. In general, it also depends on all leaders at the local level, on the political and business communities. We must all find the necessary ideas, the necessary solutions to stabilize the country's economy together. If we need to relocate businesses from certain areas, we have to do it. If we need to update legislation and give businesses more room for development, MPs must do so quickly. If we need to create special conditions for the return of people, and the security situation in a particular area allows, every leader at any level must make every effort and do everything possible to return people to such safe areas. Today, the 42nd day of the Russian invasion has come to an end. This is not too much for military history. But for the life of a particular person - it is tangible. Right now, many of our people who left their cities, their communities after the invasion of Russia may wonder: what next? And where next? In particular, Ukrainians abroad. In particular, Kyivans and residents of other cities in the north and center of our state who moved to the western regions. And I call on all community leaders in areas where there is no threat of direct confrontation with the enemy on the ground to do everything possible for people to return, for people to work, for economic processes to restart. To restore normal life as much as security allows. This applies to the entire horizontal of local government - mayors, deputies of city and regional councils. Look for solutions for every district, for every region! Together with the government, together with us, with the Office of the President, together with the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada. A working economy is just as important as our brave, strong army. The Russian occupiers continue to accumulate fighting force to realize their ill ambitions in Donbas. They are preparing to resume an active offensive. We are preparing for a further reduction of Russia's military potential. Manpower and equipment. We will fight and we will not retreat. We will look for all possible options to defend ourselves until Russia begins to seriously seek peace. This is our land. This is our future. And we will not give them up. I never tire of thanking each of our defenders everyday - all our Armed Forces, intelligence, special services, the National Police, everyone who allows us to hope and believe in victory. Allows us to count on peace. Sincere gratitude! Sincere respect! And before delivering this evening's address, I traditionally signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 168 servicemen of the Armed Forces. And 3 servicemen from the Main Directorate of Intelligence. Eternal glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for our state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Speaker! Dear Mrs. President!  Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear members of the Greek Parliament! Greek people! Kalimera! For more than a montow, my every morning begins with Mariupol. With what is happening in this Ukrainian city, which Russian troops are simply destroying. This has never happened in the history of Europe in all the years after World War II that a city is destroyed to ashes, destroyed completely. That it is under blockade and its inhabitants are killed with starvation and thirst. It was a city of half a million people! About a hundred thousand people still remain in it. But there are virtually no undamaged buildings, the vast majority of buildings in the city are completely destroyed. The Russian military destroyed everything. They blew up hospitals, maternity hospitals and apartment buildings. They even blew up the city theater where civilians were hiding from bombs and next to which were inscriptions that everyone saw - the inscriptions \"children\". The inscriptions seen by Russian pilots, which did not stop them from air strikes. Mariupol is almost destroyed. I'm sure each of you has already seen what the city looks like now. After it was approached by the Russian Federation. Just ruins. This is what Russia has done with our peaceful Mariupol. But also with your peaceful Mariupol. This city has always been home to a large Greek community. The Ukrainian Greek community is one of the largest in the world. For centuries, our people have lived side by side, raised children and built the future. The ties between Ukraine and Greece are so old that it is now impossible to find their origin. Greek poleis on our Black Sea coast, cultural exchange and trade, community coexistence - all this is thousands of years of history. Greek Chersonesus was even depicted on our national currency - hryvnia. It is with Greece that the development of Christianity is tied not only in our country, but also in our region in general. Ukraine is one of the largest Orthodox countries, and the light of Baptism was brought by the Greeks. If someone tried to snatch Greek roots from Ukrainian history and culture we would lose a fundamental part of ourselves. In the same way the basic things of your history, your national self-perception are tied with the Ukrainian land. \"Freedom or death!\" - these words now reflect not only our struggle against Russia's attempt to conquer Ukraine. This is a part of your identity that comes from our Odesa. Another southern city of Ukraine that Russia may try to destroy, as well as Mariupol. When your foreign minister was in Odesa last week, the city was experiencing the consequences of Russian shelling, another missile attack. There are no gunshots in Odesa today. But why? Only because the Armed Forces of Ukraine are deterring Russian attacks and repelling barbaric Russian troops from their direction of attack on Odesa long-agreed by Russian leadership. Russian troops have now brought death and destruction to where Ukrainians and Greeks have enjoyed peace and prosperity for centuries. Moreover, Russia has begun a new deportation of people from the south of Ukraine. At least tens of thousands of our people have already been deported to Russia and to the territories of Ukraine temporarily occupied by Russia. These are residents of Mariupol and other cities and communities that came under attack by Russian troops. This forced relocation of people by Russia is not the first one for both Greeks and Ukrainians. But the Russian state is carrying it out now as if deportation is not the last one. Russia is absolutely convinced of its impunity for everything it does. We have to stop it! We must bring Russia to justice. We must save Odesa from the same destruction that Mariupol suffered. We must find everyone, all the people deported by Russia. We must save at least those in Mariupol who are still alive and who can be saved! Ladies and Gentlemen! Greek people! Filiki Eteria, founded in our Odesa, has played a role in the history of your country, which cannot be overestimated. And I urge you now, openly, to create such a new union of friends, which will be able to save the Ukrainians and Greeks of the south of our state. Which will be able to help Mariupol. The city needs humanitarian aid! The city needs its people - survivors and wounded - to be saved. Russia has been blocking Mariupol since the beginning of March, blocking on land and at sea. It does not allow even basic humanitarian cargo into the city. I am convinced that the strength of Greece can help carry out this mission. Days are numbered. And now I ask you to listen not only to me. Regarding the fate of this city. Please listen to the two defenders of Mariupol who are now there, right there, and together with their colleagues are trying to stop the Russian offensive. Listen to two Ukrainians, but also two Greeks as well. One of them is forced to wear a mask, not to show his face. Because his family, his parents are in one of the Russian-occupied towns. I hope you understand. I am grateful to Greece for the humanitarian and defense support already provided to Ukraine. I am grateful for the support of the general sanctions policy of the democratic world. But the war continues. The destruction of Mariupol continues. You have heard these heroes. The deportation of people from the territories where Russian troops came continues. I urge you to use the influence of your state and your opportunities, as a member of the European Union, to organize the rescue of Mariupol. I urge you to do more to make Russia seek peace and even give up its dreams of conquering Ukraine. Because this war that Russia has started against us is actually destroying everything that Ukrainians and Greeks have created together in a long time. What will be left after the Russian artillery and Russian bombs? I will tell you: they will destroy all our common history, our common heritage. And we will not be comforted saying about Mariupol in the future: \"These are new Thermopylae\". When the heroes died, stopping a large enemy army. Now we can save our heroes. And we can also drive the enemy Russian army out of Ukrainian land. We can teach Russia and any other potential aggressors once and for all that whoever chooses war always loses. He who tries to deprive of independence and destroy the territorial integrity of states always loses. Anyone who blackmails Europe with an economic or energy crisis always loses. Let's be honest, Russia's actions from the beginning were aimed not only at Ukraine, but at Europe as a whole. Russia is doing everything to keep Europeans without available energy. And to make energy poverty a new reality on the continent. Russia is doing everything to provoke an outbreak of inflation for many nations. Russia last year artificially created a deficit in the European gas market. And now it is doing everything to artificially create a deficit in the world food market. It is a matter of honor for Europeans to respond to such a policy of the Russian Federation. As long as Russian troops block peaceful cities and deport people, no Russian bank has the right to make money from the world's financial system. They all must be blocked! All, not just part. As long as this pointless and brutal war continues, no Russian vessel has the right to enter the ports of the democratic world. Why help them? For them to earn even more money for missiles and bombs to destroy not only Mariupol, but also Odesa and other Ukrainian cities? And first of all - no support for Russian tankers, these oil carriers, which provide Russia with a constant flow of money for the killings. Ukraine needs weapons to force Russian troops to leave our country. In particular, air defense systems, artillery systems and shells, armored vehicles and other things that everyone in the West is well aware of. The sooner Ukraine receives this assistance, the more lives we will be able to save in Ukraine. And one more thing. Historical. Our nations have always been and will always be closely bonded. I believe that we will be able to bring peace to our Ukrainian land. We will be able to bring to justice all those responsible for these war crimes against Ukrainians, against Greeks and against all other people who fell victim to the Russian military. We will be able to rebuild Mariupol and all other Ukrainian communities where Ukrainians and Greeks will live just as peacefully and with respect for each other as it was before. But I also believe that Ukraine and Greece will soon live on an equal footing in our common European home, the European Union. I believe in this! I know it! We will win everyone! But only together! Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President of the Republic of Cyprus! Dear Mrs. President of the House of Representatives! Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies! Dear Cypriot people! I am grateful for the honor of addressing you in this format and at this time. At a crucial time for my country and for the survival of the Ukrainian people. For freedom in Europe. It is now being decided whether we will preserve the unity of our territory and our state. Whether we will guarantee freedom for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe. For different countries where Russian troops can go after Ukraine. Every day and night we think of only one thing - how to save as many people as possible. How to help everyone we can to survive Russia's brutal invasion. An invasion that has already killed thousands of Ukrainians. Shot, tortured, killed by missiles, air bombs, tanks. The Russian military does not spare anyone - neither women nor children. Ukrainians have not seen such atrocities since the Nazi invasion during World War II. And I ask you... Please, just look. Look at what we have been going through for 43 days already. Please watch a short video. God forbid any other nation will have to go through this… Experience how Russian soldiers killed people on the roads in Bucha for fun. How in Irpin, they raped underage girls and then strangled them as experienced killers. How in Mariupol, a little girl was forced with gunshots to run down the street. Because it is permissible for them to hunt people, it is fun for them. How in Kharkiv, dozens of ordinary civilians were killed in a minute by the artillery shelling of residential high-rises. When you see so many deaths every day... When killed people are buried in mass graves in your cities, just in the yards, because it is impossible to take bodies to cemeteries... You hope and seek, and believe that you will be able to save at least those whom you especially sympathize with. At least those who certainly cannot be involved in any disputes of the adult world, in any conflicts. Since March 10, Ukrainians have hoped to find a little boy alive, little Sashko. A four-year-old boy who disappeared when adults escaped from the occupiers on a boat across the Dnieper. There was no other way to escape then - the Russian military blocked all roads. They shot people on the roads. So the adults tried to escape from them by the river. But the boat capsized. According to witnesses, after the shelling... Sashko was the only one in the life jacket, so we hoped until the end. We hoped to find him alive. Sashko’s grandma died. And later we found his body. He became one of 167 children who died during the full-scale Russian invasion of our state. And these are only those about whom we know for sure. There may be many more children killed in the occupied areas, in the cities around which hostilities are taking place. Children whose lives were taken by this war, Russia's war against Ukraine. Why does Russia wage this war? What is the goal of Russian troops? The answer to these questions is quite clear. We have heard it many times from politicians in the Russian Federation and from Russian state propagandists. We also know this answer from those documents that were seized along with Russian prisoners of war and found in the destroyed headquarters of Russian troops. They wanted to destroy our statehood and tear our country apart. Divide Ukraine into parts. They wanted to take as much as they could. And all that they could not capture, they wanted to weaken as much as possible, to destroy as much as possible. Russia sought to create a new split in Europe that would meet the inadequate ambitions of the current generation of Russian leaders. They simply do not take most countries in the world seriously. They do not respect most nations. They consider everyone in the world either as those they want to use, or as those they want to conquer, or as those they want to intimidate. They consider Ukraine among those in the second group. That is why Russia came to us with the war. But all other states should think into which group they were included and what really underpins Russia's policy toward them. I am sure that no country in the world will find two things among the answers to this question - true respect and not feigned equality. That is why the democratic world has united in its negative attitude towards Russia. Ukraine was attacked by Russia a long time ago - in 2014. When Russia tried to divide our state by force for the first time. When our Crimean peninsula was occupied. When Russia started the war in Donbas. But then the world's response was weak, very weak. Many in the world still believed that constructive relations could be at the heart of relations with Russia. That the dialogue with Russia can be sincere and based on the principle of mutual respect. Years have taught the world that this was all a mistake. And the invasion of Ukraine on February 24 this year showed that the Russian leadership perceived the good attitude of other states simply as a weakness. Can such behavior go unpunished? Is it right that the Russian state and its citizens are trying to use your island to their advantage? While trying to destroy the whole nation. While trying to destroy another state. Ladies and Gentlemen! Cypriot people! I am grateful to you for the principled position with which you, together with the whole of the European Union, responded to Russia's full-scale invasion. You have adopted a powerful decision not to allow Russian warships to enter your ports. This really strengthens security throughout our region of great Europe. I am also grateful to you for your financial and humanitarian assistance. For an important resolution passed by your parliament in support of Ukraine. But Ukrainian children are still dying from Russian weapons. All our citizens still live in hell because of what the Russian occupiers have done on Ukrainian land. Russia is still preparing plans for a new offensive against our troops, against our cities... The Russian leadership still does not want to seriously seek peace with Ukraine. In response to all our negotiating proposals, which could have been accepted long ago in the interests of peace, in the interests of all in Europe, we hear only a play on words. This means that much more needs to be done, both at the EU and national level, to end this war. To force Russia to seek peace. Peace is an unconditional value for each of us. Therefore, I believe that together with you we will be able to provide the necessary pressure on the Russian leadership. The Republic of Cyprus has extremely powerful tools to influence Russian society. A unique force that can be put at the service of peace. All ports in the democratic world must be completely closed to Russian ships. This must be a joint decision - at the level of the European Union. But at the level of your state, it is also possible to at least freeze the use by Russians of all their yachts and other vessels in your waters. You can suspend the current privileges for Russian citizens. Starting from the so-called golden passports for all Russians without exception and ending with dual citizenship for them. Probably if it is verified and clearly proven that some of them condemn the war crimes of their military and do not intend to use your jurisdiction to avoid sanctions and other restrictions against Russia, only then will it be permissible to treat these people in the old way. Any efforts by Russian citizens subject to sanctions to circumvent these restrictions must be stopped. All the proper work needs to be done to prepare the European Union for the imminent embargo on energy supplies from Russia. I do not know how many more war crimes of the Russian military must be revealed, as it was in our city of Bucha, before all EU states have enough courage for the embargo. But Russia itself has chosen this path. It destroys innocent people in Ukraine. The democratic world must stop being a sponsor of Russia's war crimes. Of the destruction of cities, killing of children. And the democratic world must learn to guarantee real security for every state that can fall victim to aggression. When Ukraine says that we deserve full membership in the European Union, we mean, first of all, that we can bring to our common European home exactly the experience that can make each EU state stronger. It is an experience that can give Europe more justice. I'm sure you feel our pain. And that is why I believe that you will continue to support Ukraine, including on the road to the European Union. On the way to our common peace. Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! The 43rd day of full-scale war is over. Russia's war against Ukraine. A war that has revealed the whole truth about our country, about all other countries, about Russia and about the world in general. This war shows how much everyone did not want to notice in our country. In our people. How much the world believed in foreign propaganda and Russian myths about Ukraine, not in reality. We have always been like that... We have always been brave. The bravest in the world. I am sure of that. Because who else would do what Ukrainians do? Who else had so much courage to constantly fight against any manifestations of tyranny and defend freedom? In every election, in revolutions and in war. Who else had the courage to fight against all Russian forces on land, in the air and at sea? Who else had the courage to go unarmed against Russian armored vehicles where the Russians temporarily managed to seize something? Who else had the courage to tell the world that hypocrisy is a bad weapon? And not just to tell, but to convince and restore honesty in the world. Who else had the courage to persuade the largest global companies to forget about accounting and recall morality? And to teach all political leaders - whatever they are - to be at least a little Ukrainian... At least a little brave. In fact, this is our brand. This is what it means to be us. To be Ukrainians. To be brave. If everyone in the world had at least ten percent of the courage that we Ukrainians have, there would be no danger to international law at all. There would be no danger to the freedom of the nations. We will spread our courage. We will start a special global campaign. We will teach the world to be not just a little bit, but full of courage. Like us, like Ukrainians. There are certain results already. First of all, they are manifested in the current sanctions against the Russian Federation. But that's the thing - the results are still \"certain\". Not yet the ones needed to stop Russia. To stop the war. Please note: this is not the first day that the media has been talking not about how sanctions against Russia actually work, but about why these sanctions are important. As if they are convincing themselves that they have introduced the right things, that there are enough restrictions. But if the sanctions really worked one hundred percent, they would not have to explain in such detail why they are important. Therefore, I emphasize once again: more sanctions are needed. Even bolder sanctions are needed. Courage must be a criterion for evaluating decisions. Courage and practicality. First of all, Ukraine needs weapons that will allow us to win on the battlefield. And this will be the strongest sanction against Russia of all possible ones. We have good diplomatic news today. Russia is gradually losing even on those platforms that it considered quite comfortable for itself. In particular, the UN General Assembly decided to suspend Russia's membership in the Human Rights Council. It is quite logical. Quite rightly. But also not without fighting for this decision. I am grateful to those states that have supported this decision. Russia has had nothing to do with the concept of human rights for a long time already. Maybe someday that will change. But so far, the Russian state and the Russian military are the greatest threat on the planet to freedom, to human security, to the concept of human rights as such. After Bucha, this is already obvious. And the work on dismantling the debris in Borodyanka began... It's much worse there. Even more victims of the Russian occupiers. And what will happen when the world learns the whole truth about what the Russian military did in Mariupol? There, on almost every street, is what the world saw in Bucha and other towns in the Kyiv region after the withdrawal of Russian troops. The same cruelty. The same heinous crimes. More and more information is coming in that Russian propagandists are preparing, so to speak, a \"mirror response\" to the shock of all normal people from what they saw in Bucha. They are going to show the victims in Mariupol as if they were killed not by the Russian military, but by the Ukrainian defenders of the city. To do this, the occupiers collect corpses on the streets, take them out and can use them elsewhere in accordance with the elaborated propaganda scenarios. We are dealing with invaders who have nothing human left. To justify their own killings, they take the murdered people simply as scenery, as propaganda props. And this is a separate war crime, for which each of the propagandists will be held accountable. More and more countries around the world support the need for a full and transparent investigation of all war crimes of the Russian occupiers in Ukraine. Every murder case will be solved. Each of the torturers will be found. All those who committed rape or looting will be identified. Responsibility is inevitable. Today I continued to address the parliaments and nations of neighboring countries, our partners, our friends. Today was Greece. Today was the Republic of Cyprus. I thanked them for supporting Ukraine and joint European efforts to force Russia to seek peace. I urged to do more to stop the war. I urged Greece to use its influence as part of the European Union to save Mariupol. I urged Cyprus to take special measures against Russia. Such as the abolition of \"golden passports\" for Russians. As well as the blocking of yachts, the blocking of other Russian vessels in the waters of Cyprus. I am planning an address to the Parliament and the people of Finland tomorrow. I would like to note that diplomatic representatives of other states are returning to the capital together with Kyiv residents. The Turkish Embassy returned yesterday. The Ambassador of Lithuania returned today. Earlier, the Slovenian Embassy resumed its work in Kyiv. I am sincerely grateful to the friends of Ukraine who support us exactly as we need it now, also at the level of symbols, at the level of diplomatic gestures. This is also about courage. And I look forward to the opportunity to have a meeting with everyone who is with us. With all who are brave. Come back. With all the diplomats who have returned to our capital and continue to work. The presence of foreign diplomatic missions in Kyiv is a normal work of embassies, it is a clear signal to the aggressor that Kyiv is our capital. Not the provincial city of Russia, but the Ukrainian capital. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to do everything to repel the offensive of Russian troops in Donbas. The occupiers’ troops in this area are becoming more active and are being reinforced from Russia. We see it all. We analyze every step of the enemy. And we will provide an answer. A tough one. And already a stable tradition: before delivering this address, I signed decrees to honor our bravest soldiers with state awards and the title of Hero of Ukraine. 344 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded. Five more servicemen became Heroes of Ukraine today. I am sincerely grateful for the service to each of our male defenders. I am sincerely grateful to each of our female defenders! I am sincerely grateful for the courage of the Ukrainian people. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Speaker! Dear Mr. President! Dear Mrs. Prime Minister! Members of the Government! Dear Eduskunta deputies! Dear Mr. Federal President of Germany! Dear Chairman of the Swiss Federal Assembly! People of Finland! I'll start with what happened this morning. The Russian military struck at the railway station in our city of Kramatorsk. At the usual train station. At the ordinary people, there were no militaries. At the people who were waiting for trains to leave to a safe area. They hit people with missiles. There are witnesses, there are videos, there are remnants of missiles, but there are no more people. At least 30 dead. About 300 wounded. This is for now. Once again: this is an ordinary train station. An ordinary city in the east of our state. That's how Russia came to \"defend\" Donbas. That's how Russia came to \"protect\" Russian-speaking people. This is how we live for the 44th day. After 8 years of war in the east of our country. I ask you to honor the memory of all Ukrainian men and women killed by Russian soldiers, Russian missiles, Russian bombs with a moment of silence... Thank you. Russia has sent all its combat capable forces from all over their territory up to the Far East to seize Ukraine. But even they were not enough. That is why Russia is gathering as many people as possible who are capable of holding weapons in order to continue the aggression against Ukraine. Looking for mercenaries around the world. Sending militants from various de facto terrorist groups and so-called \"private armies\" created by some Russian officials. We have seen so many of them among the captured Russian military. Both very experienced killers and very young boys born in 2003-2004. But none of them could adequately explain why they need this war against Ukraine, what is the purpose of these missile strikes at civilians, what is the purpose of the cruelty that the world saw in Bucha and other cities liberated by the Ukrainian army. Of course, among the nearly two hundred thousand Russian occupiers on our land were those who did their best not to fight. Who fled to Russia, who deliberately surrendered, who inflicted severe injuries on themselves to get to the hospital and leave the war zone. But still it was a minority. And the majority of their army continues war on our land for no apparent reason. Absolutely pointless. And as cruel as possible. Continues to fight in a way that you often think - are they people at all? Yesterday, the Russian military fired from artillery at a boat with civilians on the Kakhovka reservoir. People were just trying to escape from the occupied territories. But they were hit by \"Grad\". Three children, eleven adults. On the boat. In the middle of the reservoir. Tens of meters from the shore. And they are being hit by artillery... Hundreds and hundreds of cars with gunshot traces remained on all roads of our country in the areas where Russian troops entered. Ordinary cars of ordinary people who just wanted to live. The Russian military knew for sure that those were ordinary civilians. They saw that there was no threat. But they fired. There are many examples of such cars with people who were simply crushed by armored vehicles. Literally - crushed by tanks. You all know what the Russian military has done in our city of Bucha. But they still make such Buchas every day - from Kramatorsk to Mariupol, from Kharkiv to Kherson. And I'm sure you realize that if the Russian army is ordered to invade your land, they will do the same to your country. I do not wish you this. They will do what happened in Bucha to your cities. To the cities of any country that the leadership of the Russian Federation decides is allegedly part of their empire, not the land of another nation. And even if Russian soldiers do not understand why they need it, they will still be at war. Because it is hatred and contempt for other people that are being brought up now in Russia at the state level. Ladies and Gentlemen! People of Finland! You have already seen in your history the cruelty and absurdity of the invasion of Russia. Let's be honest: the threat remains. Everything must be done to prevent this from happening again. Russia's war against Ukraine is now deciding not only the fate of our state. Not only the fate of our people. But the fate of all those who have a common border with Russia. Like you 83 years ago, Ukraine has the courage to defend itself against the enemy whose forces far outnumber them. There are just a lot of them, in quantitative terms. They have a lot of equipment and a lot of missiles. A lot of people who can be thrown into the war. And a lot of dollars and euros earned from oil trade that are then spent on propaganda of aggression. But just as your courage saved your country from Stalin's invasion, our courage resists this invasion. For 44 days already. But much remains to be done to win. Of course, unlike before World War II, the democratic world has now realized that the expansion of tyranny cannot be ignored. If the people are fighting for freedom, they must be supported. But, unfortunately, this understanding is more common among nations than among some very influential politicians. Among smaller states than among some leading states. We still have to convince the world's powerful states on a daily basis that sanctions against Russia that it will not be able to circumvent and that will definitely stop its military machine are necessary. We still have to ask for the necessary help, for the necessary weapons. And we are still told that we still have to wait for the aircraft, anti-missile systems, tanks, anti-ship weapons. We are told that we have to wait while we are losing hundreds of people every day from Russian strikes. When dozens of our cities are destroyed. We have to wait while more than ten million Ukrainians have become IDPs. And we have to wait. When more than three million of these ten left our country... We must do everything together so that they can return home. We must do everything to stop Russia, to stop the war! So that peace is restored in Ukraine, and the Russian occupiers leave our sovereign territory. This cannot be delayed, ladies and gentlemen. We are told that we have to wait... But I have a question: should both those who kill our people and those who make us wait be held jointly accountable for the deaths of Ukrainians? Those who make us wait for the most necessary. Wait for the opportunity to defend ourselves, our life, wait for the weapons. I am sincerely grateful to Finland for not delaying when this invasion by the Russian Federation began. For coming to our aid immediately. For the fact that you made a historic decision to provide Ukraine with defense support. For being principled in sanctions matters. For being one of the moral leaders of our anti-war coalition. But I ask you to show even greater leadership, both at the level of the European Union and in bilateral relations with European countries, to support our struggle for freedom. For our common freedom. When this war continues, when tyranny loses the war against Ukraine, it will be one of the greatest contributions to Europe's security in decades. Consequently, one of the greatest contributions to the security of your state. That is why we need the weapons that your EU partners have. That is why we need truly effective, powerful sanctions against Russia. Permanent. Such a sanction cocktail, which will be remembered as Molotov cocktails. Insist on it! I am grateful to the Finnish companies that have already stopped working in the Russian market. But economic ties with this country must be severed, and I urge you to put pressure on all your companies that continue to support the Russian military machine through their taxes and excise duties in Russia. All Russian banks must be immediately isolated from the global financial system. We cannot limit ourselves to a partial response to Russia's threat to Europe and the democratic world, because freedom will not survive if the channels of nourishing tyranny are left. And we need to think together about how to protect Europe from Russia's energy weapons. Every educated person knows that the time of fossil fuels has passed. Mankind can no longer rely on coal, on oil. We need to look for cleaner energy sources for everyone. And if Russia uses energy to finance aggression against other nations and the spread of hatred in the world, it should be an additional incentive. This should speed up the decision-making process. How much longer will Europe ignore the need to impose an embargo on oil supplies from Russia? This is a matter of security in all senses of the word - from environmental to military. And I urge you to ask this question out loud to everyone in the European Union. So that the necessary decision finally appears. The world knows the formats of how to do it. And if Europe does not want to physically cut off supplies now, if it is not ready, although it is inevitable, the first step must be to apply a scheme to limit the flow of money for oil into Russia. Let this money accumulate on special accounts without Russia's access to it. Let Russia first restore peace and be held accountable for war crimes, and only then take its dollars and euros from oil trade. Let it remember the spirit of Helsinki and restore the Helsinki Accords in full, and only then will it be possible to discuss the economy, if necessary. And when we say that we need to stop the war, it is clear to all cultures and it is clear in all languages. When I say this in Ukrainian, it seems to me that there are no people who do not understand this. The same goes for German, Arabic, Chinese or any other language. Peace is the same value for all. War is the same evil for all. Ladies and Gentlemen! People of Finland! I believe that common sense will still prevail. I am confident that together we will be able to defend freedom and defend Ukraine. That is why we need to think now about how to rebuild our state after this war. The world knows about the leadership of your country, your people in the field of education. You have really built an educational system that allows you to protect personal freedom, make a person educated and teach respect for other people, the environment and the world. Other countries should learn this, too! During the month and a half of the Russian invasion, 928 educational institutions in Ukraine have already been destroyed or damaged. These are kindergartens, these are schools, these are universities. I invite your state, your companies, your specialists to join the restoration of our educational sector and the modernization of education in Ukraine. We must do everything we can to ensure that, even after this brutal war against our nation, our people continue to cultivate goodness in their hearts and stay open to the world. I believe in that. Because hatred must lose. Freedom must win. First - in Ukraine, and then - wherever tyranny will try to raise its head. Thank you Finland! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! The 44th day of our defense against the Russian invasion is coming to an end. The 44th dark day. Russian troops launched a missile attack on the Kramatorsk railway station this morning. 38 people died on the spot. Another 12 people died in hospitals during the day. We lost five children. Dozens more heavily wounded remain in hospital. This is another war crime of Russia, for which everyone involved will be held accountable. Russian state propagandists were in such a hurry to shift responsibility for the attack to Ukrainian forces that they accidentally blamed Russia. RIA Novosti reported that the strike on Kramatorsk had been inflicted when the missiles were still in the air. The day before, other Russian propagandists were spreading threats to all those who escaped from Donbas by rail. All the world's leading powers have already condemned Russia's attack on Kramatorsk. We expect a firm, global response to this war crime. Like the massacre in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile strike on Kramatorsk must be one of the charges at the tribunal, which is bound to happen. All the efforts of the world will be aimed to establish every minute: who did what, who gave orders. Where did the rocket come from, who was carrying it, who gave the order and how the strike was coordinated. Responsibility is inevitable. I spoke about this today with representatives of the European Union who arrived in Kyiv. With President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and head of European diplomacy Josep Borrell. During the day, they visited Bucha and witnessed the consequences of the occupation. They saw how many people were killed by the Russian military. I appreciate the EU's readiness to provide the necessary financial and technical assistance to document and investigate Russian crimes. I am grateful to the President of the European Commission for her personal involvement and assistance in setting up a joint investigation team to establish the full truth about the actions of the Russian occupiers and bring all those responsible to justice. I am also grateful for the financial support - one billion euros for weapons. Plus today we agreed on another 500 million euros for defense needs. I held negotiations with the Prime Minister of Slovakia and thanked for the unprecedented defensive and other support. For the warmth of Slovak hearts towards Ukrainian men and women. We also talked with EU officials about further steps to force Russia to seek peace. I emphasized that the existing sanctions are not enough. The pressure on Russia must be increased. It is necessary to introduce a full energy embargo - on oil, on gas. It is energy exports that provide the lion's share of Russia's profits and allow the Russian leadership to believe in its impunity. This allows Russia to hope that the world will ignore the war crimes of its army. We will not allow this. Everyone in the world who has the courage, like Ukrainians, to resist tyranny will not allow this. Russian banks must also be completely disconnected from the global financial system. Not some of them, but all, the entire banking system of Russia. It is inadmissible that the greatest threat to global security is finding its way to global wealth. In this context, I also evaluate the new announced package of sanctions against Russia. I believe the softness with which some in the West still treat the Russian state is wrong. We know who is constantly trying to soften sanctions proposals. And we will do our best to finally make Europe understand: in any case, you will have to impose really principled and really strong sanctions against Russia. And not some partial restriction of Russian energy exports. Not some partial restriction of Russian navigation. We know everyone who delays the decisions. But I am confident that both these politicians and these countries will change their position under the pressure of all that Russia is doing against Ukrainians and against freedom in Europe. I addressed the Parliament and the people of Finland today. I called on Finnish politicians to do everything possible to help Ukraine. I also reminded that the best way to stop tyranny and protect freedom is to provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons. The weapons we have repeatedly asked for from the West. The weapons that are available there. I will continue to fight every day, literally every hour, to get everything our state needs. Russia's war against our people may end in victory of freedom much sooner than many in the world think if Ukraine simply receives the weapons the list of which we have provided. Any delay in providing such weapons to Ukraine, any excuses can mean only one thing: the relevant politicians want to help the Russian leadership more than us Ukrainians. No matter what, we will continue to protect our land and our people in any case. Yes, not everyone in the world has found the courage we have. But we have powerful and principled partners and friends. Real friends who help Ukraine to really protect us. To really protect freedom in Europe. I am convinced that Ukraine's victory is only a matter of time. And I will do my best to reduce this time. By the way, we also talked today about the time needed for Ukraine's full accession to the European Union. Today we received a questionnaire from the European Commission. Finally. A questionnaire the answers to which will be the basis for preparing the conclusion of the European Commission on Ukraine's readiness for EU membership negotiations. Our Government will prepare answers qualitatively and very quickly. I think in a week. Next is the conclusion of the European Commission, which will be prepared in the next few months. And then there will be the decisions of the member states and the negotiations on accession. I am convinced of our success on this path. I am convinced that we are finally close to realizing our long-standing goal. Ukraine will be one of the equals in our common European home. Ukraine will be a member of the European Union. A peaceful, sovereign, rebuilt state. We will provide it. There is no doubt. We are also preparing for tomorrow's mass event in Warsaw, which will take place within the initiative of President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau – Stand for Ukraine. It is about the support for Ukrainians, for our migrants. All funds will be allocated for the support of Ukrainians. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Free people of a brave country! Today, it was a great honor for me to welcome in our capital, on Bankova Street, a sincere friend of Ukraine - Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson on your behalf, on behalf of all Ukrainians. His visit to our country demonstrates as clearly as possible - there are no obstacles to freedom. There are no obstacles to leadership. Boris was among those who did not hesitate for a moment whether to support Ukraine. The leadership of the United Kingdom in providing our country with the necessary assistance, especially in terms of defense, as well as the leadership in sanctions policy will remain forever in history. In the history of the defense of democracy, in the history of the defense of Europe. Ukraine will always be grateful to Boris and Britain for this. Today Boris arrived in Kyiv with a new package of financial and defense support for Ukraine. We also discussed new sanctions that are needed to force Russia to seek peace. The task of our anti-war coalition is quite clear - to end this war started by Russia as soon as possible. To liberate our land from invaders. And to guarantee the security of Ukraine and, consequently, the security of democracy and freedom of the nations of Eastern Europe. That is why it is not just the moral duty of all democracies, all the forces of Europe - to support Ukraine's desire for peace. This is, in fact, a strategy of defense for every civilized state. To put pressure on Russia as much as possible to restore peace and security as soon as possible. To restore the power of international law as soon as possible and to prevent the catastrophe caused by the application of the law of force. The catastrophe that will inevitably hit everyone. Because Russian aggression was not intended to be limited to Ukraine alone. To the destruction of our freedom and our lives alone. The whole European project is a target for Russia. I was pleased to hear today from Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer an assurance that for the Austrian state to force Russia to seek peace is as fundamental as for other responsible states. I also heard the promise that Austria, together with its partners in the European Union, will continue its sanctions policy against Russia until the full restoration of real security in our region takes place. Until Russia withdraws all its troops from the Ukrainian sovereign territory. In response to my question, the Austrian Chancellor also supported a clear prospect of Ukraine's accession to the European Union as soon as possible. I would also like to thank Mr. Nehammer for handing over fire engines and rescue vehicles, as well as other equipment to Ukraine, and for helping with fuel. There is also important news today from President of the European Commission Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. As part of their global Stand Up For Ukraine campaign, they have raised more than $ 10 billion to help our people. To help Ukrainians who were forced to leave their homes because of Russia's war against Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who joined the fundraising! That is, today was a really fruitful day for Ukraine. For our diplomacy. And this is the 45th day of our defense against the Russian invasion. Could Moscow think that such events would take place in Kyiv on the 45th day after their invasion? No, they couldn't even imagine it. And we made it a reality. All of us, together - every Ukrainian who on February 24 and forever chose courage. Chose Ukraine. Chose freedom and the future. In all international negotiations, in all contacts with world leaders during these 45 days, I always raise three topics. The first is concrete assistance for our defense. The second is concrete assistance for our people. The third is concrete guarantees of security for our state, which will definitely win in this confrontation. Of course, I do not hear specific answers to my specific questions from everyone. But there are more and more positive things for Ukraine every day. However, still not as much so that we can determine the exact date of the end of this war. Russia can still afford to live in illusions and bring new military forces and new equipment to our land. And it means that even more sanctions are needed. Even more weapons for our state are needed. By the way, Boris Johnson was very specific today in answering my questions. Well, as always. We have already decided what help the United Kingdom will provide to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. The British people are ready to take patronage over the restoration of Kyiv and the Kyiv region. The introduction of more painful restrictions on cash flows of the Russian Federation is among the priorities for our diplomacy, for all contacts with our partners. First of all this applies to the oil business. The democratic world can definitely give up Russian oil and make it toxic to all other states. Oil is one of the two sources of Russian self-confidence, their sense of impunity. Another source - gas - will also be shut down over time. It's just inevitable. Not only for safety, but also for environmental reasons. But Ukraine does not have time to wait. Freedom does not have time to wait. When tyranny launches aggression against everything that keeps peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately. It is necessary to act in a principled fashion. And the oil embargo should be the first step. At the level of all democracies, the whole civilized world. Then Russia will feel it. Then it will be an argument for them - to seek peace, to stop pointless violence. And another piece of news for today. Long-awaited for many of our people. One of our main shrines will return to Ukraine. One of the most revered shrines of Sophia of Kyiv. The icon of St. Mykola Mokryi (Wet), the first miraculous icon of Russia. We’ve been working for a long time to get it back. It was taken out of Ukraine during World War II. And in due time it will be at home - in St. Sophia. I am grateful to the hierarchs, clergy and faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the United States for this decision. I want the return of this shrine to be an important symbol for all of us. A fundamental symbol. A symbol that we will return all ours to Ukraine. Everything Ukrainian. We will bring all our people back. And we will definitely restore justice - restore our complete control over our land. I am grateful to all our friends! I am grateful to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! The bravest people of the best country in the world! Another week of our struggle for freedom, for the state, is coming to an end. Another week when Ukraine lives despite all Russia's efforts to destroy us. We defend ourselves. Hit back. We develop our relations with partners. We receive help. We ensure the maximum attention of the world to our needs. Influence the global debate. Propose and promote new sanctions against Russia. We are doing everything we can to bring to justice every bastard who came to our land under the Russian flag and killed our people. Who tortured our people. Destroyed our cities. Looted and tormented. And what is Russia doing? What are its officials, its propagandists and ordinary people doing who repeat what they have heard on television? They are only justifying themselves and denying. They are trying to shift the responsibility. They are lying. And they have already lost connection with reality to a degree that they accuse us of committing what Russian troops have obviously done - obviously for everyone in the world. They say about the murders in Bucha that it is not them, but allegedly us. Although it is obvious to everyone that people were killed while the Russian army controlled the city. They say about the missile strike at Kramatorsk that it is not them, but allegedly us. Although it was their propagandists who announced this strike. Although missiles flew from the territory under their control. And about any of our destroyed cities, about any of our burned villages, they say the same thing, that it is not them either, but allegedly us. The Russian militaries have already lied to the fact that even after more than six weeks of war, they claim that they did not hit any of the civilian objects! Do you know why this is so? Because it's cowardice. Total. Of everyone. Top to bottom. They are afraid to admit that Russia's entire policy toward Ukraine has been erroneous for decades and has only ruined everything Russia had in its relations with Ukraine since previous times. They are afraid to admit that for decades they have been placing erroneous bets and spending enormous resources in support of absolute nobodies who they thought would be the future heroes of Ukrainian-Russian friendship. And these nobodies were skillful at only one thing - taking money out of Russia into their own pockets. In order not to admit mistakes, they made new mistakes. They deprived themselves of any political tools and, unwilling to give up unrealistic ambitions, started this war. And, as in everything else, they accused us that the war had begun. They seized Crimea - and we are allegedly to blame. They destroyed normal life in Donbas - and we are allegedly to blame. They shot down a Malaysian Boeing - and we are allegedly to blame. They have been killing people and children on our land for eight years - and we are allegedly to blame. They destroyed the most powerful industrial region in Eastern Europe - and we are allegedly to blame. They ruined the lives of millions of people - and we are allegedly to blame. They started a full-scale war against us - and we are allegedly to blame. They have already spent almost two thousand missiles, countless air bombs and artillery shells, mines on strikes at Ukraine - and we are allegedly to blame. They tortured and killed on our land - and we are to blame. They deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men and women, our children - and yet we are allegedly to blame. It all came from cowardice. When cowardice grows, it turns into a catastrophe. When people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologize, adapt to reality, learn, they turn into monsters. And when the world ignores it, the monsters decide that it is the world that has to adapt to them. Ukraine will stop all this. Nothing will help Russian cowardice. The day will come when they will have to admit everything. Admit the truth. All our strength and every minute are aimed at this. Defense, diplomacy, economics, information confrontation, legal responsibility - we have algorithms of action in all areas. Every government official knows his tasks and must fulfill them one hundred percent. Next week will be no less important than this one than the previous ones. It will be just as tense and even more responsible. Russia will be even more afraid. Afraid to lose. Afraid that the truth will have to be admitted. Russian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state. They can use even more missiles against us, even more air bombs. But we are preparing for their actions. We will respond. We will be even more active in providing Ukraine with weapons. We will be more active in the international arena. We will be even more active in the information field. I will continue to address the parliaments and nations of the world. We will meet our partners, leaders of other states in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. We will attract even more funds and resources to help Ukraine. Of course, we will justify stronger sanctions against the Russian Federation. So that there is responsibility, so that there is justice. No matter how afraid they are to admit their mistakes - tragic, terrible mistakes - they will have to. Because our courage and our truthfulness clearly prevail. And they will win. Today is the twelfth anniversary of the plane crash near Smolensk, which took the lives of President Lech Kaczyński and members of the Polish elite. On this day, we stand in solidarity with our Polish friends and allies who are firmly opposed to Russian aggression. I spoke today with Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz. About how to bring to justice all those guilty of war crimes. How to strengthen sanctions against Russia and how to force Russia to seek peace. I am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favor of Ukraine. I consider it absolutely logical. Because this course is supported by the majority of the German people. And I am grateful to them. But I expect that everything we agreed on will be implemented. And this is very important. And a few minutes ago, in preparation for the recording of this address, I signed a decree on state awards to our heroes. 18 defenders of Ukraine. Five servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, three employees of the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine, ten police officers. I am grateful to all our male defenders! To all our female defenders! I am grateful to all those who restore life in the liberated territory of our state. And I am grateful to all those who ensure our victory in the information confrontation. To all journalists, to editors, to the information marathon \"United News\", to all our websites, to all media representatives that do not allow Russian propaganda to win. The truth will win! Ukraine will win! Definitely. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Speaker. Dear deputies of the National Assembly, Ladies and Gentlemen, Korean people! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you on behalf of the whole of Ukraine, which has been opposing the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation for 47 days already. Russia attacked us. Attacked, taking advantage of its military force. This state has spent decades preparing for this war. Decades and enormous resources. Financial resources - hundreds of billions of dollars received for the export of oil and gas and used for the production and accumulation of weapons. As well as human resources. Already about 2,000 missiles have been fired at our cities by Russia. Artillery shells are simply impossible to count. But the worst thing is how Russia uses people to prepare and wage war. For the people of Russia such conditions are deliberately created when they are forced to live in total, utter poverty. When they can't afford even the simplest things - normal food, ordinary household appliances, normal education. When they do not have even basic human rights guarantees throughout their lives. And when service in the army for many of them becomes the only, so to speak, social mobility option. Opportunity to get at least something in life. At least somehow try to fend for oneself. When they got to the war and entered the territory of a neighboring state, tens of thousands of Russian servicemen were simply shocked by the normality of life. They were shocked by cities and villages where people were not in need. Shocked by home appliances in houses. Shocked that people had normal food. A significant number of occupiers simply have never seen such a thing in their lives. Almost immediately, Russian troops started looting in the territory of Ukraine - in those areas that they managed to invade. They tried to take home to Russia everything of any value. From washing machines to computers. From auto parts to clothes. They just stuffed armored personnel carriers, trucks, stole cars and tried to take out the loot. You know, there were cases when Russian soldiers took protective plates from their bulletproof vests to hide stolen laptops and tablets in bulletproof vests. It is impossible to believe - when a person is so poor from birth that he thinks that a laptop is more valuable than his own life in the war. But this is exactly what we saw on our land when the Russian army invaded. It is a collision of two different worlds. The world of ordinary people who just lived a peaceful life, just wanted harmony for themselves and their children, thought about the future. And the world of people who have been specially humiliated by their state for decades, specially driven into poverty and lawlessness, so that their government can send them to any venture. To any war against neighbors. And this is Russia's war not just to conquer Ukraine. This is only the first step. First, Russia wants to destroy our independence, our state, to tear it apart. Wants to destroy everything that makes us Ukrainians, makes us a separate nation. And then it wants to go further to Europe. Further to Asia. In the occupied Ukrainian territory, the Russian military purposefully searched for teachers, any people related to the army and the functioning of the state, activists, journalists. All those who educated and defended the national idea. Such people were abducted. Such people were killed. Deliberately. It was an order, it was a tactic. But Russia has only just begun with Ukraine. The next step in their plan is to destroy other states. Attempt to conquer other neighboring nations. Russia wants to dominate. And it believes that it can do this in only one way: sending its army brought up in total lawlessness to destroy everything that allows other nations to live. With missile and air strikes at our territory, Russia has already destroyed hundreds of infrastructure facilities that ensured normal economic and social life in Ukraine. Russian missiles and aircraft are destroying oil depots, destroying food warehouses, airports, railway stations, manufacturing plants and universities. 938 educational facilities alone have been destroyed. Almost 300 hospitals. This is a deliberate tactic of the Russian troops, not something accidental. They are deliberately destroying residential neighborhoods and entire cities. Using artillery, mortars, tanks. Not one city, not two, not three. These are dozens of cities that the Russian military simply tried to wipe off the face of the earth. Black ruins instead of high-rises. Piles of stone and concrete debris instead of ordinary peaceful cities. We still cannot determine the number of deceased. From the north to the south of the country - in all areas where Russian shells reached, bombs reached - the dismantling of debris is still ongoing. Active hostilities are still going on in part of our territory. Russia is preparing another offensive. Hoping to break our national resistance after all. The occupiers concentrated tens of thousands of soldiers and a huge amount of equipment to try to strike again. The worst situation is in Mariupol, in our southern port city, which has been blocked by Russian troops since March 1. It was a city of half a million. Half a million people. The occupiers blocked it and did not even allow food and water to be brought there. They tried to capture it in the most brutal way - just to destroy everything in the city. Mariupol is destroyed. There are tens of thousands of dead. But even despite this, the Russians do not stop the offensive. They want to make Mariupol a demonstratively destroyed city. Ladies and Gentlemen, Korean people! This could be seen in the 20th century. And you remember that. You know what it's like to defend your land. You remember when in the 1950s you were attacked by those who wanted to destroy your freedom. They destroyed, they killed. What would they have left from your identity if they had succeeded? This is a horrible question. But you withstood, the world helped you. Now we want the same. There is no hope that Russia will simply stop on its own. There is no hope that reason will prevail, and the Russian leadership will simply refuse to continue this war. Russia can only be forced to do so. It can only be forced to seek peace. Forced to stop tormenting people. Forced to respect the independent life of neighboring nations. Forced to leave the territory of Ukraine. Our anti-war coalition, formed after the beginning of this brutal invasion of Russia, has already imposed unprecedented sanctions against it. But these sanctions are not enough. Russia does not yet feel that it must stop. This means that much more needs to be done. And not only at the state level. Russian banks' ties with the global financial system must be severed. It is necessary to limit Russia's exports of energy resources, especially oil. But it is also necessary that world companies stop being sponsors of this barbaric state, which believes that it has the right to destroy the lives of nations. Which believes that it has the right to sow poverty, lawlessness and death around the world. The more companies stop trading with Russia, work in Russia, pay taxes to the Russian state, the faster reason will win. Russia will have to give up militancy and seek compromises with the world. Because it has already come to the point that Russia is openly blackmailing the world with nuclear and chemical weapons! But working strategically, we need to protect people here and now. Protect those directly threatened by the Russian army. For 47 days we have been defending ourselves against virtually the entire Russian army - its most capable units. Our Armed Forces of Ukraine are fighting heroically, very wisely, rationally using available resources and weapons. We receive help from around the world. And I am sincerely grateful to your state, sincerely grateful to your people for their support. But we need much more. To survive in this war against such a prepared adversary as the Russian Federation. Against a state that does not count the dead and has countless stock of military equipment since the days of the Soviet Union… We need air defense systems, aircraft, tanks and other armored vehicles, artillery systems and ammunition. And you have something that can be indispensable for us. You have it. Armored vehicles, anti-aircraft, anti-tank, anti-ship weapons. When it comes to survival in a war aimed at the complete conquest of the people, it is necessary to give principled answers. The usual rules for the supply of weapons must be reviewed and action must be taken quickly. It is necessary to help. Providing the necessary weapons to Ukraine means not only saving the lives of our people, not only giving us the opportunity to unblock our cities, in particular our long-suffering Mariupol, but also saving other states and other regions from further deployment of Russian aggression. Every nation has the right to live independently. Every city has the right to complete security. Every person has the right to freedom and to seek personal happiness. People should not be instruments of some regimes, some dictators. People have the right to just live. That's what we're fighting for. That’s what we ask you to defend with us. And that is what we will rebuild - I hope together with you and the whole world - after this war. Ladies and Gentlemen! Korean people! Today in this address I mentioned our Mariupol four times. Our city, which is experiencing the darkest time in its history. Our city, which Russian troops are simply destroying. I would like you to watch one video now. Footage taken by a journalist who endured weeks of Russian blockade in Mariupol. I ask you to see with your own eyes what Ukrainians have been seeing for 47 days. We ask for help to stop this. For the cities of Ukraine and other states to never see such evil again. So that Russia can never come to them again."

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 47th day of the Russian-Ukrainian war, this shameful invasion that is gradually wiping Russia out of international relations, is coming to an end. Invasion that makes it more and more toxic every day. Now it is only a matter of time before the Russian army with its own actions and war crimes forces everyone in the world to renounce all ties with the Russian Federation. Security work is underway in the northern regions of our country, from where the occupiers were expelled. First of all, it is mine clearance. Russian troops left behind tens if not hundreds of thousands of dangerous objects. These are shells that did not explode, mines, tripwire mines. At least several thousand such items are disposed of daily. The occupiers left mines everywhere. In the houses they seized. Just on the streets, in the fields. They mined people's property, mined cars, doors. They consciously did everything to make the return to these areas after deoccupation as dangerous as possible. Due to the actions of the Russian army, our territory is currently one of the most contaminated by mines in the world. And I believe this should also be considered as a war crime of Russian troops. They deliberately did everything to kill or maim as many of our people as possible, even when they were forced to withdraw from our land. Without the appropriate orders, they would not have done it. This afternoon I met on Bankova Street with an expert group working on the creation of a special mechanism for pre-trial investigation and judicial review of all war crimes committed by the occupiers. We are working on a legal way to bring the occupiers to justice, which will be as effective and as fast as possible. In order not to wait for decades until all international legal procedures are completed, but to accelerate the onset of justice. I expect that the options for creating such a special mechanism will be presented in the near future. Today, the occupiers issued a new statement, which testifies to their preparation for a new stage of terror against Ukraine and our defenders. One of the mouthpieces of the occupiers stated that they could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol. We take this as seriously as possible. I want to remind the world leaders that the possible use of chemical weapons by the Russian military has already been discussed. And already at that time it meant that it was necessary to react to the Russian aggression much tougher and faster. The European Union has now begun discussing a sixth package of sanctions against Russia. It is time to make this package such that even a word about weapons of mass destruction is no longer heard from the Russian side. An oil embargo against Russia is mandatory. Any new package of sanctions against Russia that does not affect oil will be received in Moscow with a smile. I spoke about the need to strengthen sanctions against Russia in my address to the parliament and people of the Republic of Korea. This week I will continue this format of communication with partner countries. Tomorrow I will address the parliament and the people of the Republic of Lithuania. By the way, Prime Minister of Lithuania Ingrida Šimonytė paid a visit to Ukraine today. I am grateful to her for the support, as well as to all the Lithuanian people. The issue of punishing all those guilty of crimes against Ukrainians was also discussed today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. The second important topic of our conversation was the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. We will continue to coordinate our steps to force the Russian Federation to seek peace. I also discussed cooperation in the energy sphere with the Prime Minister of Norway. Expressed gratitude for the support of efforts aimed to force Russia to seek peace. I also held talks with the Chairperson of the African Union, President of Senegal. Informed him about the current situation in Ukraine, about the global threats posed by the Russian invasion. The key task both today and every day at this time is concrete defensive measures. A concrete increase in our ability to repel any attacks by Russian troops. I am dealing with this issue almost around the clock. I'm sure people see it, too. Just as they see that the military and technical capabilities of the enemy are still very high. Yes, Ukrainians are incomparably braver. Our Armed Forces are beating the occupiers with wisdom and well-thought-out tactics inaccessible to the Russian military. But when it comes to the necessary weapons, we still depend on the supply, on our partners. Unfortunately, we are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner. To completely destroy the enemy on our land. And to fulfill those tasks that are obvious to each of our people. In particular, to unblock Mariupol. If we got jets and enough heavy armored vehicles, the necessary artillery, we would be able to do it. But... We still have to agree on this. We still have to persuade. We still have to squeeze out the necessary decisions. I am sure that we will get almost everything we need. But not only time is being lost. The lives of Ukrainians are being lost. Lives that can no longer be returned. And this is also the responsibility of those who still keep the weapons Ukraine needs in their armory. The responsibility that will forever remain in history. Just as our gratitude will remain in history. Gratitude to those states and politicians who really helped. Who did not waste time. Who didn’t bargain when life depended on help. I also signed several important decrees. 187 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 15 servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine and 6 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate were awarded. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to 5 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in particular to 2 colonels of the medical service: Ivchuk Viktor Mykhailovych - thanks to his actions more than a hundred lives were saved in Mariupol. Both of the military and civilians. Slesarenko Oleksandr Petrovych - thanks to his actions in the city of Chernihiv, medical care was provided to more than 450 servicemen and more than 600 civilians. I am grateful to all our heroes! Glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Unbreakable people of the bravest country! Do you remember how Russia bragged that they would seize Kyiv in 48 hours? Instead, Ukraine has been repelling the enemy for 48 days. Today it is worth remembering. It is worth remembering that the Russian leadership expected to see the parade of occupiers on Khreschatyk a few days after February 24, after the beginning of the invasion. Instead they see orderly ranks of occupiers every day, whom our defenders send to hell. In 48 hours, which stretched for 48 days, the Russian army has reached a level of irreparable losses higher than that of the Soviet Union in 10 years of war in Afghanistan. Higher than that of Russia in the two wars in Chechnya. The general list of \"two hundred\" for Russia will soon reach 20,000. Literally in a few days, if not tonight. And then what? 30 thousand killed? 40 thousand? Today in Russia it was once again stated that their so-called \"special operation\" is supposedly going according to the plan. But, to be honest, no one in the world understands how such a plan could even emerge. How could a plan providing for the death of tens of thousands of your own soldiers in a little more than a month of war emerge? Who could approve such a plan? And what is the final level of their own losses acceptable for this person? Dozens or even hundreds of thousands of dead Russians? Obviously, no one in Moscow cares about the number of Ukrainian civilians killed. They say they do everything for the sake of the people, for the sake of Donbas... But even during World War II, Donbas did not see such cruelty in such a short time. And from whom? From Russian troops. In Donbas, the story of the siege of Leningrad was repeated. What for? What would the people who died or almost died in Leningrad during the Nazi blockade say about this? What would they say about the blockade of Mariupol? It was also stated in Russia today that the massacre committed by the Russian military in Bucha was allegedly a \"staging\". For some reason, the massacres in Borodyanka, Hostomel, Makariv, cities and villages of the Chernihiv region, Kharkiv region and Donbas have not been commented on yet. There are not as many \"specialists in staging\" in the world as there are murderers in the Russian army. Responsibility for war crimes is inevitable. As an example, I can mention today's result of the Security Service of Ukraine. It is very symbolic that Mr. Medvedchuk was detained on Cosmonautics Day. He has been hiding for 48 days. And finally decided to try to escape from our country. Well, for this \"astronaut\" - in the bad sense of the word - the famous \"Let's go!\" did not work. I think it is especially cynical of him to use military camouflage. He tried to disguise himself like that. Such a \"soldier\". Such a \"patriot\". Well, if Medvedchuk chose a military uniform for himself, he falls under the rules of wartime. I offer the Russian Federation to exchange this guy of yours for our boys and our girls who are now in Russian captivity. It is therefore important that our law enforcement officials and military also consider this possibility. There are more and more testimonies and other official data of the investigation about the horrible crimes of the occupiers in the areas where they managed, unfortunately, to come. About the inhuman cruelty of the Russian military towards women and children. About numerous rapes. Not all serial rapists reached the level of brutality of Russian soldiers. Of course, we will establish the full truth about all these savages. No matter how much time and effort it takes, we will find them all. And let Medvedchuk be an example for you. Even the former oligarch did not escape, not to mention much more ordinary criminals from the Russian boondocks. We will get everyone. We take with great attention yesterday's reports on the use of a projectile with a poisonous substance in Mariupol against the defenders of the city. It is not yet possible to draw one hundred percent conclusions about what kind of substance it was. Obviously it is impossible to conduct a full investigation and full analysis in the besieged city. However, given the repeated threats of Russian propagandists to use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol and the repeated use by the Russian army of phosphorus munitions in Ukraine for example, the world must respond now. Respond preventively. Because after the use of weapons of mass destruction, any response will not change anything. And it will only look like a humiliation for the democratic world. Today, in my address to the parliament and the people of Lithuania, and at the same time to all European nations, I stressed that the sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia must include oil. Stop multiplying insufficiently strong sanctions packages. In any case, you will have to acknowledge that only Europe's abandonment of Russia's energy resources and the complete restriction of Russia's banking system can be an argument for Russia's leadership to seek peace. Without this, Moscow is looking for a military solution. I also spoke today with Chancellor of Austria Nehammer who had met with the Russian leader the day before. We exchanged details about this meeting. Many people like to mock the occupiers, troll their failures, the level of training of their soldiers and the questionable quality of the \"latest\" Russian equipment, which has been developed over the past 20 years and is inferior to Soviet models. And rightly so. That's fair. But at the same time, we must understand that not all Russian tanks are stalled in the field. Not all enemy soldiers simply flee the battlefield. And not all of them are conscripts who do not know how to hold weapons properly. This does not mean we should be afraid of them. This means we must not belittle the merits of our soldiers, our army. And I want to thank them again, all our defenders. I don't get tired of doing it. And I want you and I not to tire of telling them the most important thing: we believe in you. We are proud of you. We admire you. We are also proud of all our people who take to the streets despite the occupation. Who are protesting. Who are expelling the occupiers as best they can. We are proud of all our people! That is why it should always be emphasized that if our cities and villages are occupied, it is only temporary. And they will definitely be liberated. They will be liberated by our heroes. And not only by force of arms, but also by force of morale. Morale demonstrated almost daily by Ukrainian men and women in the cities and villages of the south of our country. In the areas that Russian troops have temporarily occupied and which our army has not yet liberated. No matter what, you need to resist the occupiers. It's hard, I know. You have to fight. Protest. Defend our national statehood. And it is necessary to punish collaborators. Let them make \"KhNR\" somewhere in Khakassia, not in our native Ukrainian Kherson. The future of Ukraine directly depends on the strength of our resistance in all its forms. The future of us all, each of our cities, each of our villages. And I am grateful to everyone who understands this. Who does not stop resisting even when it seems that the result is very far. Because the darkest time is always before dawn. And today I want to separately address those heroes who are having a very hard time. Those who defend Mariupol. Marine battalion of the 36th marine brigade, Azov special operations detachment, 12th operational brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. Subdivisions of the State Border Guard Service. Volunteers of the \"Right Sector\". 555th military hospital and National Police employees. All the military who are fighting in the JFO area, who are defending Kharkiv, the Kharkiv region, all the military groups defending the Zaporizhzhia region, defending the south. Special thanks to the 92nd, 93rd, 95th brigades. Personally to General Nayev. I am infinitely grateful to everyone! On behalf of all Ukrainians. A few minutes ago I signed three decrees. 419 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 72 of them posthumously. Also, 30 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Mykolayovych Vasyliyev, commander of the missile division of the 19th missile brigade. Posthumously. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Inevitable punishment to all our enemies. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Speaker! Dear Mrs. Prime Minister! Members of the Government! Dear deputies of the Riigikogu! The people of Estonia! Thank you for the opportunity to address you today. In circumstances that take us all back to the darkest times of the 20th century. For thirty years, the nations of Europe have enjoyed peace, freedom and shared opportunities for development. Now, Russian revanchism has destroyed all the good that has worked for decades for peace in Europe, for the stability of life of European nations. Only fragments of the global security architecture are left. The same ruins as from Ukrainian cities bombed by Russian missiles and aircraft. All the international institutions that are supposed to support peace - the UN, the OSCE and others - are not able to stop Russia's aggression right now. Although this is what they were created for. Regional alliances, and above all NATO, have faced a difficult reality when no one can be 100% sure whether they will really protect their members in the event of a large-scale Russian attack. The same as the attack on Ukraine. Or in the event of an even worse attack - with the use of weapons of mass destruction. For the first time in many years, the threat of Russia's use of chemical or even nuclear weapons has to be taken seriously. Russian state propagandists, clearly guided by the relevant \"theme lists\", openly discuss Russia's ability to seize all neighboring European countries. They talk about it not just for the sake of emotions, but systematically accustom the Russian audience to the fact that war against neighbors is supposed to be the norm. Russia's attempt to seize all of Ukraine after 8 years of war in Donbas has brought back to European reality what your people had to go through. Mass deportations, filtration camps, a consistent attempt to destroy all those who support the national idea. Today, more than 500,000 Ukrainians have been forcibly displaced. Just imagine how much it is! This is as if the occupiers set, sorry for the example, the goal of deporting all people from Tallinn. The whole city - it was and now there is no one. A third of all your citizens. Deported Ukrainians are deprived of documents. Their phones are being confiscated. They are trying to take these people to remote regions of the Russian Federation. Attempts to return to Ukraine are being hindered in every possible way. Children are separated from their parents and there are attempts of their illegal adoption in Russian families... Tens of thousands of people have already been killed in Ukrainian cities affected by Russian strikes. The Russian army uses all kinds of artillery, all kinds of missiles and air bombs against residential areas and civilian infrastructure. In particular, phosphorus bombs and other munitions prohibited by international law. This is an obvious terror against the civilian population. It is an attempt to break the morale of the people, to subdue Ukrainians for generations or simply to destroy them. Why does the Russian leadership allow themselves all this? What ensures a sense of impunity for Moscow? I'm sure you know the answer to these questions. It is obvious. On the one hand, Russia enjoys its privileges in international structures. In particular, the seat occupied by it as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to block any attempts to actually return peace to Europe or other regions where Russia wages a war. Exactly Russia. On the other hand, the Russian leadership absolutely does not believe that Europe can bring Russia to justice. Moscow simply does not believe that Europe can force Russia into peace. They expect a split among Europeans and that the priority of maintaining trade for Europeans will be higher than the priority of security or even the priority of survival of Russia's neighboring nations. Ladies and Gentlemen! The people of Estonia! This is the time when we can either stop Russia or lose the whole of Eastern Europe for a very long time. Lose any hope for a safe and free life on the continent governed by universally recognized law not by force. And I thank you for understanding that. A crowded rally on February 26 with the participation of tens of thousands of Estonians in the heart of ancient Tallinn on Vabaduse Square in support of Ukraine and in support of freedom in Europe has already become a glorious page of our common history. Estonia was one of the first to provide Ukraine with the necessary assistance, this is true, including defensive aid. I am grateful to you for the sincere support of our migrants. You have been and remain exemplary in your consideration of the issues of Russia's war against Ukraine and the relevant sanctions policy in European and other international structures. I am grateful to you for abandoning Russian energy. The source of dollars and euros paid to Russia for oil and gas, which makes it self-confident and unwilling to seek equal relations with other nations. But we all need to do much more to stop Europe's immersion in the evil that the continent saw in the 1940s! In the same occupation that your country, by the way, went through as well. The black pages of history should not be repeated when deported Ukrainians and Estonians remained for many years in Siberia or the Russian Far East. There are already more than enough Ukrainian and Estonian graves - graves of those who died from communist deportations. That is why I urge you at the level of the European Union to find such instruments of influence on Russia, such instruments of pressure that could stop deportations and return all deported people home. The European Union has the power to ensure this. The European Union must use this power. Until Russia returns forcibly deported Ukrainians, until it returns thousands of abducted children, it must not receive any money from European states or companies. The European Union has no right to sponsor deportations. The European Union has no right to sponsor war. The policy of sanctions against the Russian Federation needs to be taken even more seriously. Why are sanctions necessary? Because this is the only tool to force Russia into peace. I urge you to defend the need for a complete blockade of Russian banks when approving a new, very important package of sanctions against the Russian Federation at the EU level. All banks, not just part of them. I urge you to finally add oil to the sanctions package. An embargo is needed at the level of the entire European Union! I also invite your state and your specialists to join the work of the joint group set up to investigate the war crimes of the Russian army on the territory of independent Ukraine. Technical and expert support is indispensable now as the number of war crimes already reaches tens of thousands. These are executions of civilians, torture, rape, blowing up hospitals, bombing maternity hospitals, burning food warehouses, artillery shelling of shelters in which children are hiding, and they knew about it - I emphasize that once again... There is no crime that Russian soldiers have not committed in the 49 days of this invasion. We will definitely investigate all these war crimes, identify all the culprits and find them. No matter how long it will take. But if we do it together with you, together with other European countries, we will be able to do it much faster. Keep in mind that most of Stalin's torturers didn’t bear responsibility for everything they did. Therefore, it is especially important to bring to justice a new generation of Russian executioners. And this must be done now - for what they have done in Ukraine. So that they do not have to be searched for war crimes against the Baltic nations, against Finland, Poland or any other country. All those who have already gained freedom in the 20th century must preserve it in the 21st century. Ukraine will always be grateful to Estonia for the principled support of our state in European integration. I am grateful to you for realizing that Ukraine's accession to the European Union is not just a question of economics or some abstract policy. It is a question of security and guarantees for the preservation of freedom and democracy in Central and Eastern Europe. Ukraine must receive the status of a candidate for EU membership in the near future. We must think about the post-war reconstruction of our country already now. When Russia loses, and this will inevitably happen, it will be necessary to prove to Russia and all other potential revanchists in the world that the war will not lead to the realization of their plans. We are already cooperating with your country in the field of digitization, we are already demonstrating to other European countries the advantages of modern digital systems, including in public administration. After the war, it will become even more relevant, I'm sure. For restoring the normal functioning of state institutions and local authorities. For the return of companies. For the cyber defense of Ukraine and the whole, I repeat - the whole of Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! The people of Estonia! The Presidents of the three Baltic states and the President of Poland will arrive in Kyiv in a few hours. I look forward to meeting them, to meeting your President, Mr. Alar Karis. Such visits to the capital of our state are especially important now. They are important not only for us, not only as evidence of European support for our struggle for freedom. But also as evidence that all European defenders of freedom will continue to be united. Without any political or economic \"bows\" to Russia. Europeans must make every effort to restore international law immediately. To immediately force Russia to seek peace. This task can only be done jointly by everyone in Europe. At the level of the whole European Union. Together with other members of our anti-war coalition. If Europe wastes time, Russia will use it to expand the war zone to other countries. I believe that together we will never allow this. Thank you, Estonia! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Indomitable people of the bravest country! Today was a useful day for our state, for our defense against the Russian offensive. The presidents of four states - friends of Ukraine - arrived in Kyiv. Those who help us from the first days. Who did not hesitate to give us weapons. Who did not doubt whether to impose sanctions. And who is now at the level of the European Union pushing for a tougher sanctions package against the Russian Federation. Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia. I was very glad to meet with the presidents today. The negotiations were fruitful. It is important that the presidents visited Borodyanka in the Kyiv region, where they saw with their own eyes what the occupiers had done. For the presidents, this is another argument to push harder for tangible sanctions against Russia. First of all, we need an oil embargo. And Europe's clear readiness to give up all Russian energy. The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine. Western sanctions policy was also discussed today by a group of international experts led by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak. The group has been working for three weeks. It consists of international and Ukrainian experts who assess the sanctions imposed and how Russia is trying to circumvent them. The group has prepared concrete proposals on how to remove sanctions loopholes, which are constantly used by Russia, and how to immediately enhance sanctions to make it tangible for Moscow. I spoke today with US President Biden. The topics of the conversation included the prosecution of all Russian servicemen and commanders who committed war crimes. International cooperation for this. A new package of defensive support for Ukraine was discussed. The agreement was reached. $ 800 million. Weapons, ammunition, other assistance. Artillery systems, armored personnel carriers, helicopters. Sincere gratitude for your support! We also agreed to enhance sanctions against Russia. I addressed the Parliament and the people of Estonia. Expressed gratitude for the help provided to Ukraine, including weapons. I also called on Estonia to join the project of Ukraine's reconstruction after the war. We are already cooperating with Estonia in the field of digitization. And after the war it could become an even bigger project. On restoration of government and business digital systems, on cybersecurity. On restoration of the relevant educational institutions. Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan visited Bucha. It is right that a group of forensic experts from the International Criminal Court will start working in the city. Responsibility for the Russian military for war crimes is inevitable. We will drag them all to the tribunal. And not only for what was done in Bucha. In general, in the north of our country, in the liberated areas, mine clearance continues. The occupiers left tens of thousands of unexploded shells, mines and tripwire mines - a lot of everything. Therefore, everyone who wants to return home to the liberated territory should be as careful as possible, as attentive as possible. And immediately inform the police and rescuers in case you find a strange object, an explosive object. Combat reports for today do not differ significantly from previous ones. Russian troops are stepping up activity in the eastern and southern directions. They are trying to retaliate for their defeats. Rocket bombings and artillery strikes continue. New columns of equipment are being brought in. They are looking for reserves. They are trying to recruit residents of the south of our country - that is, from these temporarily occupied areas in addition to the so-called mobilization in certain districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity. To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers, whom the commanders do not spare at all, the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. Well, we do everything to justify their doubts. And I am grateful to all our defenders who hold positions and teach Russian soldiers to think that this war against Ukraine can only end in Russia's strategic defeat - sooner or later. Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace, or as a result of this war, Russia will leave the international arena forever. And before delivering this address, as always, I signed decrees to award our defenders. 270 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 7 of them posthumously. 11 employees of the State Protection Department were also awarded. Another decree awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to 2 servicemen of our Armed Forces. Posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to everyone who protects the people and protects our state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Unbreakable people of the bravest country! We have withstood 50 days already. 50 days of Russian invasion, although the occupiers gave us a maximum of five. That's how they \"know us\". That's how they \"make friends with reality.\" Russia did not start the war against Ukraine on February 24. Russian troops came to us in 2014. They captured our Crimea. They turned it into a large military base. They made the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov one of the most dangerous seas on the planet. They started a terrible, absolutely cynical war in our Donbas. They have been killing our people for 8 years. 14 thousand were killed during this time! How did the world respond to this? The question remained rhetorical. But that is why they decided they could afford a full-scale war. Some are still debating the severity of sanctions against the Russian Federation. But what is there to discuss when Russian troops are already repeating on our land what Europe saw only during World War II? During the 50 days of full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, they showed that Donbas is the main target for Russia. It is Donbas that Russia wants to destroy in the first place. It is the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that Russian troops are destroying as if they want only stones to be left. And no people to be left at all. They forcibly recruit residents of these areas into their army. They throw them into the worst battles, literally in the frontal of our defense. They are destroying the cities and villages of Donbas. They burn everything that endured eight years of that war. For 80 years, proud and tidy Kharkiv has not seen such torments that Russia has brought to it. Why do they destroy it? What can be achieved by burning Kharkiv? What exactly can destruction on Saltivka or on Freedom Square give to Russia? And these are no longer rhetorical questions. This is a question of how absurd this invasion of the Russian Federation is. How suicidal it is for everything that Russia allegedly \"protects\". For Russian culture, for relations with this nation, even for the Russian language. Russia is burning all this with its weapons. For decades at least. For generations. Ancient Chernihiv. Which is over a thousand years old. Which saw so many wars and so many invaders that at least in the XXI century it deserved peace and tranquility. But... Russia came. Came with the worst that Chernihiv has experienced since the X century. Since the period of Rus’ relation to which Russia once claimed. Now this myth is also burned. Rus’ would not destroy itself. Strangers did that to it. Horde and other invaders. That's who came to our land today. And they are fighting in the same way - for the sake of looting and for the sake of torture. Thank God, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and our people, we defended most of our country. I remember the first day of the invasion of the Russian Federation. I remember what I was told on February 24. In particular, the strong of this world. To put it mildly, no one was sure that we would withstand it. Everyone sympathized. Many of them advised me to flee the country. Advised to actually surrender to tyranny. But they didn't know us either. And they did not know how brave Ukrainians are, how much we value freedom. Our opportunity to live the way we want. Not the people who rule in such a way that their army sees toilets for the first time in their lives in the occupied territories and steals even ordinary household appliances. The occupiers will be responsible for everything they have done in Ukraine. For everything they did to Ukrainians. They will be responsible for Bucha, Kramatorsk, Volnovakha, Okhtyrka. For Hostomel and Borodyanka. For Izyum, for Mariupol and all other cities and communities of Ukraine, which the Russian army pulled back to the period 80 years ago. To that terrible time, about which everyone in the world has always said: \"Never again.\" Here it is again. Here it is now. And we will do everything to make it truly the last. Because the question \"How to guarantee security for Ukraine and for Europe?\" will never be rhetorical again. We will not allow this. I am grateful to everyone who supported our state. Who immediately asked how they could help. Who stood with us back to back and helped us get what is necessary for the defense of our state. This period, these 50 days have shown me many world leaders in a different way. Different states. I have seen great generosity in those who are not rich themselves. I have seen the extraordinary determination of those who were not taken seriously by global leaders. I have seen that the democratic world does have those whose will is enough to protect freedom from the onslaught of tyranny. I have seen politicians behaving as if they had no power. And I have seen non-politicians who did more in these 50 days than some statesmen who claimed leadership. But all that is just an add-on. An add-on for how Ukraine is defended by our people, all our people. Those who stopped the advance of endless columns of Russian equipment. Those who rebuff constant attacks in Donbas. Those who heroically defend Mariupol, helping our entire state to withstand. Those who stopped the offensive from the south. And made our Chornobaivka famous. Those who drove the enemy out of the north. Those who have shown that Russian aviation is defenseless, even though Russia has spent tens of billions of dollars on various systems to protect its aircraft. Those who have shown that Russian ships can go... to the bottom only. Those who help the army and society find everything they may need. Those who save, heal, those who teach. Conduct mine clearance. Who provide us all with a stable connection. Those who rebuilt supply chains for the whole country. Those who maintain financial stability, who saved the business and continued to work. Those who help the displaced persons. Those who started the sowing campaign. Those who give Ukraine the correct information and the necessary emotions. All our journalists, all those who united for the national telethon. 50 days of our defense is an achievement. Achievement of millions of Ukrainians. Everyone who made the main decision in life on February 24 - to fight. To be human. Not to give up. And not to betray. From time immemorial to the present day, mankind has been looking for heroes. People always appreciate heroes. They always support those who are brave. And always feel who is fighting for the good. During the 50 days of this war, Ukraine became a hero for the whole free world. For those who have the courage to call a spade a spade. For those who are not poisoned by propaganda. You have all become heroes. All Ukrainian men and women who withstood and do not give up. And who will win. Who will return peace to Ukraine. I'm sure of it. I spoke today with our team, which will take part in the Invictus Games international sports competition. Among them are both veterans and servicemen who are currently defending our state. They are deeply concerned that they had to go to the competition. I assured them that we will wait for their return and will support them in the competition just as sincerely. I believe that our team will make us proud of it this year as well. And traditionally, as every evening, I signed decrees on awarding those who excelled in the defense of the state. 221 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 34 of them posthumously. And two employees of the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Major Kukurba Oleksandr Vasyliovych, chief of intelligence of the 299th tactical aviation brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Thanks to his courageous actions, dozens of enemy equipment units and hundreds of occupiers were destroyed. I also awarded those whose surnames cannot be told. But I awarded them for what is definitely good for everyone. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! I am sure that you periodically see in the media - Ukrainian and Western - reports on how long this war can last. Some say a few weeks. Others - several years. Some say the war will last until the end of this year. And someone advises to prepare for a permanent confrontation with Russia as long as it exists. Of course, I also hear different predictions. I have much more information than some media outlets about the intentions and capabilities of the Russian army. About the potential of the Russian economy. About the emotional state of society in Russia. All this must be taken into account before saying how long the war will last. Therefore, we must take into account the effectiveness of instruments of influence on Russia used by Ukraine and our entire anti-war coalition against Russia's aggression. The success of our military on the battlefield is really significant. Historically significant. But not enough to clean our land from the occupiers yet. We’ll beat them more. Sanctions against Russia are very significant. Economically painful. But still not enough for the Russian military machine to be left without means of subsistence. We promote stronger, more destructive ones. So, in fact, it is these two areas that determine how long this war will last. I always tell all our partners with whom I discuss this issue that the amount of support for Ukraine directly affects the restoration of peace. It literally defines how many more Ukrainians the occupiers will manage to kill. If someone says: year or years, I answer: you can make the war much shorter. The more and the sooner we get all the weapons we have requested, the stronger our position will be and the sooner peace will come. The more and the sooner we get the financial support we have requested, the sooner there will be peace. The sooner the democratic world recognizes that the oil embargo against Russia and the complete blockade of its banking sector are necessary steps towards peace, the sooner the war will end. So the number one task is to speed up the restoration of peace. Our Armed Forces are doing it brilliantly. They are repelling the occupiers' attacks. They are carrying out counterattacks. They have already tormented - in the true sense of the word - Russian conventional aviation so much that they are forced to use strategic long-range aircraft. I am grateful to each of our defenders for this great work. Our diplomats must continue their activity in all possible directions, at all possible levels. Both official and unofficial. The next package of sanctions against Russia must include an abandonment of Russian oil. In general, the democratic world must admit that money for Russian energy resources is in fact money for the destruction of democracy. When these decisions are made, we will all be able to see that peace is approaching. I held a meeting with government officials today. The key topic is the solution of urgent economic issues that arose during martial law. It was noted that four-fifths of all Ukrainian enterprises have already returned to work in a safe area. In particular, this applies to heavy industry enterprises. Transport networks are being rebuilt. Good performance is shown in trade and services. And all this is also the fulfillment of the national task of accelerating the restoration of peace. That is why I am grateful to everyone who keeps jobs, who employs our people, who helps businesses adapt to these difficult conditions and gives Ukraine the necessary economic strength to live. No matter what, in all cities and communities where there are no occupiers and hostilities, it is necessary to restore the economy to the maximum. Energy issues and the end of this heating season were discussed. The season was successful in spite of everything. Despite all the predictions, tariffs have not increased. There were no rolling blackouts. Supplies were not disrupted even in wartime. Preparations have also begun for the next heating season. We discussed the purchase of gas, the purchase of coal. We offer at least for the next 6 months the electricity tariff in the amount of 1 hryvnia 44 kopecks per kilowatt for those who use less than 250 kilowatts. This is 80% of our people. The Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food reported that the sowing campaign has begun and continues in all regions of our country, including Luhansk and Donetsk. We also talked to government officials today about filling in the questionnaire that Ukraine received from President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. This is a necessary stage in the preparation of our country to become a candidate for EU membership. The work is almost complete, and we will soon provide the answers to the representatives of the European Union. I held an important meeting today with all the leaders of the state power bloc. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Chief of the General Staff, Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Commander of the National Guard, Minister of Internal Affairs, Head of the Security Service of Ukraine. The meeting was also attended by the Head of the President's Office, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council and the head of our delegation at the negotiations. The main topic is Mariupol. Details cannot be made public at the moment. But we are doing everything to save our people. The restoration of normal life in those areas and districts where the occupiers were expelled continues. The amount of work is really huge. 918 settlements of different scales, but equally important for us, for Ukraine, have already been de-occupied. We carry out demining. We restore the supply of electricity, water and gas. We restore the work of the police, post office, state and local authorities. Humanitarian headquarters have started working on the territory of 338 liberated settlements. We are resuming the provision of regular and emergency medical care, the work of educational institutions - where it is really possible. In total, on this day, Russian troops have destroyed or damaged 1,018 educational institutions across our country. Restoration of roads and railways has begun. In particular, from tomorrow the railway connection with Chernihiv and Nizhyn will be restored. Trains are already running between the cities of the Sumy region. The teams of Ukravtodor and Ukrzaliznytsia work quite efficiently, and I am grateful to them for this speed. For giving people back a sense of normal life, which the occupiers tried to destroy forever. In the south and east of our country, the situation is still very difficult, far from talking about recovery. In the occupied districts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, the Russian military continue to terrorize civilian residents of our country. They are looking for anyone who has ever been associated with the Ukrainian army or government agencies. The occupiers think that this will somehow make it easier for them to control the territory. But they are wrong. They deceive themselves. The problem of the occupiers is not that they are not accepted by some activists, veterans or journalists. Russia's problem is that the entire Ukrainian people does not accept it and will never accept it again. Russia lost Ukraine forever. Actually, it lost the whole world. It will not be accepted anywhere anymore. And the cruelty with which Russian troops are trying to conquer the Azov, Donbas, Kharkiv regions, only takes away even the slightest chance of these territories and these people to have any ties with this state at least sometime in the future. Maybe somewhere in Russia cruelty is respected. But in Ukraine cruelty is despised. And punished. And it is obligatory. Today I signed decrees on awarding our military. 237 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 34 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Kashchenko Dmytro Valeriyovych, commander of the 58th separate motorized infantry brigade of the Operational Command \"North\" of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For the personal example of heroism that inspires comrades in service, for extremely effective combat operations and concrete and very important results for maintaining the positions of our army and expelling the occupiers. And finally. The important words that hope always wins even under seemingly insurmountable circumstances. This Saturday, the Jewish community celebrates Passover. Holiday of liberation. Holiday of life. I sincerely wish all those who celebrate in Ukraine and in the world peace, good and the inevitable defeat of any evil that threatens freedom and life on earth. Chag Pesach Sameach! I am grateful to all our male defenders! I am grateful to all our female defenders! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear free people of the most beautiful country! A country that has a future. That's true. This is what motivates us to fight now. On the battlefield and around the clock on the diplomatic, information and economic fronts. This is what allows us to plan our lives after the war. Our Ukrainian free, sovereign and democratic future. Definitely – peaceful. Definitely – with development. Today I held a meeting dedicated to the reconstruction of our cities. Of course, this is a huge amount of work. But still less than defending the state in war. Than that we all – all Ukrainians, our army and all our people – are already really doing. So don't be afraid of the scale. What is important in our project of reconstruction of Ukraine? The task is not only to physically rebuild the houses, apartments, bridges and roads, businesses and social infrastructure that were destroyed by Russian troops. Not just to give people back everything they lost and give them a new foundation in life. Now it is a historic moment. The moment when we can solve many old problems of the whole environment of our life once and for all. When we can make quality urban planning where it did not exist. We can take into account real traffic flows. Guarantee energy saving, environmental friendliness of materials, inclusiveness. This is when it comes to the organization of living space and the quality of reconstruction. But there is also justice. Housing queues have existed for decades and never ended. This has been the case since Soviet times. Millions of people know how difficult it is to get a home, earn money for their own apartment, build a house. It has always been especially painful for the military, law enforcement, and public sector workers. For those who work for society and receive very little from the state for it. Last year, I set a task for the government – to do everything possible to provide all veterans, who were waiting in line, with housing this year. Next, we planned to provide all our military with housing. And now we are actually expanding last year's task to the whole state and refining it so that it would be a real modernization of Ukrainian cities and Ukrainian communities. And we combine this with the housing energy modernization program. As a result, there will be several stages. Today, I set a task to provide temporary housing to all our IDPs at the first stage. Those whose house was destroyed by war. Temporary housing until we rebuild their homes. Or until people receive compensation in square meters or money. In the second stage, we restore what the occupiers tried to destroy. All affected cities and communities. And at the third stage, we provide housing for all those who have defended or are defending the state, who have worked or are working in the interests of society, and do not have their own housing. It can no longer be the case that a person devotes his whole life to military service, but retires without having his own apartment. It can no longer be the case that a son or daughter is defending Ukraine in the war, and a father and mother do not have their own housing and are forced to live in a rented apartment or look for other options. It can no longer be the case that a doctor or nurse, teacher or law enforcement officer spends his whole life honestly and stays in a dormitory for decades, if not for life. The government, all central authorities together with local authorities must ensure this. And they will ensure. Everyone in Ukraine has the right to their own housing, their own home or their own apartment. The right to a safe and comfortable living space that will be designed for anyone. All those whose homes were destroyed by the occupiers, and all those who were waiting in line for many years. All our people who deserve to live in a modern environment. To implement this project, we are already involving leading architects, the full potential of the state and international support. The participation of companies, partner countries, international donors can be added. I have absolutely no doubt that we will be able to do this. It will be possible not only to restore that was destroyed, but also to restore justice for those whose right to housing has been violated. We also discussed the issue of memorializing what Ukrainians experienced during this war. They discussed how to preserve parts of this experience so that it would always remind all generations of our people of the brutal and senseless invasion Ukraine has been able to fend off. As one of the examples, a project of a memorial complex is being prepared, which will tell the story of the destroyed bridge in Kyiv region, which connected Irpin and Bucha with Kyiv. The story of people, who escaped from Russian invaders to Kyiv using this bridge and this road. I met today with servicemen of the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection. I handed over awards. The contribution of special communications servicemen to our defense, to our path to victory and peace, cannot be overestimated. Their work should be mentioned more often, they should be thanked more loudly. Since the first day of the war, we have had stable communication both within our country and with Ukraine's partner states. I am sincerely grateful to everyone who provides it! I spoke today with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson and Prime Minister of Sweden Magdalena Andersson. On defense and other support for Ukraine. On toughening the sanctions policy against Russia. On the situation in various areas of hostilities in Ukraine, and especially on Mariupol. And about options to help city defenders and civilians. The situation in Mariupol remains as severe as possible. Just inhuman. This is what the Russian Federation did. Deliberately did. And deliberately continues to destroy cities. Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol. There are only two ways to influence this. Or the partners will give Ukraine all the necessary heavy weapons, planes, and, without exaggeration, immediately. So that we can reduce the pressure of the occupiers on Mariupol and unblock it. Or – a negotiating path, in which the role of partners should also be decisive. I want to be heard right now: there has not been a single day since the blockade of Mariupol that we have not sought a solution. Military or diplomatic – anything to save people. But finding this solution is extremely difficult. So far, there is no one hundred percent valid option. This applies to both military options and the negotiation process. Although we have heard many intentions from those who wanted to help and who really in positions of international influence, none of them have been realized yet. However, we will not abandon these efforts. And every day either I, or Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Valeriy Zaluzhny, or other military, or head of our negotiating team David Arakhamia – in touch with our defenders of Mariupol. Every day. Traditionally, before the evening address, I signed a decree on awarding our defenders. 186 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 13 servicemen of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Two officers of the Security Service of Ukraine. And one fighter of the National Guard. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today, Christians of the Western rite celebrate Easter. The happiest Christian holiday. A holiday of the victory of life over death. The Ukrainian Catholic community unites millions of people. And I sincerely wish everyone peace. I wish you to keep the light of soul even in this dark time of war against our state. To keep it to see how good will soon surely defeat evil for the sake of our country, and how the truth will overcome any lies of the occupiers.A wonderful gift for the holiday was made by our team at the \"Invictus Games\", in which veterans and servicemen take part. On the first day of the competition, which started in the Netherlands, the Ukrainians won \"gold\", \"silver\" and \"bronze\". Rodion Sitdikov won the \"gold\" in the shot put. Artem Lukashuk and Ivan Heretsun brought Ukraine \"silver\" and \"bronze\" in long jump. Thank you guys from all of us, from all Ukrainians! This is always important, and now it is extremely important. To glorify our flag, to perform the Ukrainian national anthem and to honor our heroes. But whatever the day and whatever the holiday, the task remains the same for everyone in power. Work not even one hundred, but two hundred percent to ensure our defense. Provide Ukraine with weapons, financial support and all other supplies. I began this day with a meeting with the military and government officials on the situation in combat zones. Russian troops are preparing for an offensive operation in the east of our country. It will begin in the near future. They want to literally finish off and destroy Donbas. Destroy everything that once gave glory to this industrial region. Just as the Russian troops are destroying Mariupol, they want to wipe out other cities and communities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. We are doing everything to ensure defense. We are in constant contact with partners. We are grateful to those who really help with everything they can. But those who have the weapons and ammunition we need and delay their provision must know that the fate of this battle also depends on them. The fate of people who can be saved. The 53rd day of the war is over, and we have been waiting for answers to some points in our weapons inquiries for 53 days. And some answers are formulated so that delivery can begin only in May. I speak directly in such cases: every delay in weapons, every political delay is a permission for Russia to take the lives of Ukrainians. This is how Russia interprets it. That should not be the case in reality. Constant shelling of our city of Kharkiv continues. Today, Russian troops hit, in particular, the streets of Culture, Shevchenko and Darwin. Apparently, these are especially dangerous words for Russia - \"culture\", \"Shevchenko\", \"Darwin\". This is something that threatens its existence. As of this moment, the list of dead from this strike includes five Kharkiv residents and at least 15 wounded. In the last four days alone, 18 people have been killed and 106 have been wounded by the Russian shelling of Kharkiv. This is nothing but deliberate terror. Mortars, artillery against ordinary residential neighborhoods, against ordinary civilians. The democratic world must also react to what the occupiers are doing in the south of Ukraine - in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Torture chambers are built there. They abduct representatives of local authorities and anyone deemed visible to local communities. They blackmail teachers. They steal money provided for paying pensions. Humanitarian aid is blocked and stolen. They create starvation. The occupiers are also trying to tear off the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, following the example of the so-called DPR and LPR. This territory is being transferred to the ruble zone and subordinated to the administrative machine of Russia. All this requires greater speed from Western countries in preparing a new powerful package of sanctions. The answer to the attempted \"ruble occupation\" of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions must be full coverage of the Russian banking and financial systems by sanctions. Because they are part of the occupation machine. Of course, the need for an embargo on oil supplies from Russia is growing every day. Everyone in Europe and America already sees Russia openly using energy to destabilize Western societies. Russia's bet on chaos in fuel markets should not succeed. And today I really want to support once again all those who are fighting for Ukraine in the cities and communities of the south of our state. Who protect our national symbols. Who protect our freedom. Every manifestation of such a struggle makes it difficult for the occupiers to carry out their task. Sabotage the orders of the occupiers. Do not cooperate with them. Protest. It is necessary to hold on so that Russia does not manage to distort life in other cities of Ukraine, like it did in Donetsk and Luhansk. I spoke today with Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva. On ensuring the financial stability of Ukraine and on preparations for the reconstruction of our state after the war. We touched upon specific areas of possible cooperation with the IMF both in the near future and in the next few years. I am confident that progress in our relations with the fund will be tangible. And I want to thank Mrs. Kristalina for her personal and significant support. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal reported today on the implementation of the order on additional social assistance due to the war. First. Every displaced person can receive financial assistance for living. Every month it is 2 thousand hryvnias for an adult and 3 thousand hryvnias for a child. It is possible to apply for this in the nearest administrative services center, bodies of social protection, and starting from Wednesday - in \"Diia\". Second. People are being evacuated from the war-torn areas. The government is deploying special locations to ensure temporary accommodation for people and provide financial assistance immediately at railway and bus stations. Third. Applications for destroyed or damaged housing are being collected through \"Diia\". Be sure to apply if you have lost an apartment, house or if they have been damaged by shelling. Fourth. I urge employers, no matter how difficult it may be, to try to employ displaced persons. Now every job saved and every extra job is helping protect the state in war. For each displaced person whom the business hires, the company will receive co-financing of labor costs from the state. This is 6,500 hryvnias. The application can also be submitted on the \"Diia\" portal. Traditionally in the evening I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 188 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 553 warriors of the National Guard. 64 border guards. 5 police officers, 26 employees of the State Emergency Service. 6 defenders of Ukraine were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. And finally. Another congratulation - also for our heroes, for Ukrainian firefighters. Today is the Day of Firefighters. And I sincerely congratulate everyone who protects the security of our people, our land from fire. Who is at war almost every day even in peacetime. Thank you for your service! Thank you for saving us! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 54th day of our defense against the Russian invasion is coming to an end. The Russian army is not slowing down the use of missiles against Ukraine. Although it should have realized that it will be extremely difficult for it to restore the missile arsenal given even already imposed sanctions. Without imports, they can't even do that. And when all the loopholes used to circumvent sanctions are closed, and when even tougher sanctions are imposed, restoring Russia's missile capabilities will be unrealistic. That is, Russian missile strikes lead to only one thing - missile self-demilitarization of the Russian Federation. A similar process is taking place with other Russian weapons. Producing new artillery, aircraft, new helicopters and cruisers under sanctions will be a daunting task for Russia. None of the missile strikes has changed the situation for Russia tangibly. And if you evaluate them all together, the conclusion will be - this is strategic nonsense. Today's strikes at Lviv, at the Dnipropetrovsk region and any other Russian strikes mean only one thing: we, the world and history will take from Russia much more than Russian missiles will take from Ukraine. Every lost life is an argument for Ukrainians and other free nations to perceive Russia exclusively as a threat generation after generation. And any infrastructure can be restored. And we will definitely do it. In the east and south of our country, the occupiers are recently trying to attack in a little more thought-out manner than before. They are putting pressure, looking for a weak spot in the defense of our state to go there with the main forces... Apparently, Russian generals, accustomed to neglecting any losses, have already killed so many Russian servicemen that even they have to be more careful, as there will be no one left to attack. However, they should not hope this will help them. It is only a matter of time when the whole territory of our state will be liberated. It can now be stated that Russian troops have begun the battle for Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time. A very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive. No matter how many Russian soldiers are driven there, we will fight. We will defend ourselves. We will do it daily. We will not give up anything Ukrainian, and we do not need what’s not ours. And I am grateful to all our fighters, to all our heroic cities in Donbas, to Mariupol, and also to the cities of the Kharkiv region which are holding on, defending the fate of the whole state, repelling the forces of invaders. Rubizhne, Popasna, Zolote, Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Kramatorsk and all others that have been with Ukraine all these years and forever. I spoke with the President of the Republic of Lithuania and friend of our country Gitanas Nausėda. I informed him about the situation in the combat zones and especially about the situation in Mariupol. We are coordinating our actions to increase Russia's liability for the war. I also spoke with the Prime Ministers of Bulgaria and Croatia. About the threats created by Russia to free navigation in the Black Sea, about our cooperation at the level of the European Union, about the effective support for Ukraine and the development of solutions for the restoration of peace. I held an important meeting today on the post-war reconstruction and development of Ukraine. We need to work out everything in detail already now to be fully prepared when the war is over. We are developing a comprehensive plan that provides for the reconstruction of what’s destroyed, the modernization of state structures and the maximum acceleration of Ukraine's development. It is not just about the amount of physical work - to build housing, restore businesses, attract new businesses that will work to rebuild infrastructure and renew economic relations in our country. It is also about rethinking how our country will develop in the future. What industries can be the basis of growth after the war. What solutions and resources are needed to increase the level of processing in Ukraine and stop selling raw materials, as it was before. Which cities will become the locomotives of economic and technological growth, pulling up the surrounding areas. As of now - if you listen carefully to all the discussions that are taking place in our country at different levels about the post-war reconstruction - the main topic in them is actually about money. What financial package is needed to recover from the war? But I always emphasize that money is not the foundation for the country's development. Ideas, people - that's the foundation. And when there are ideas, when there are our people, you begin to see what money is needed for and in what amount. We need to have a clear vision of this or that branch of our economy, the direction of development we expect from this or that city, the benefits this or that institution can bring to the state as a whole. Of course, for small and medium-sized businesses we must provide the most comfortable and free environment. In terms of taxes and administrative relations. Of course, digitization is a top priority. Security is also a top priority for us. Defensive potential must be at a new level. Of course, judicial, anti-corruption and other important reforms need to be brought to fruition. But all this must work for a concrete vision of what Ukraine will be like. What it will be like a year after the war, 5 years after the war, 10, 20 years after. What exactly will be important for our people. What exactly will be important for global business. How many jobs and in what industries will be available to Ukrainians. Ukraine's accession to the European Union is an integral part of this strategic vision. And in this context, today was a historic event - we are going through one of the stages before joining the EU. We provided answers to a questionnaire received from Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, and Josep Borrell, Head of European Diplomacy. Each country that joined the European Union went through the same procedure with the questionnaire. The only difference is that it took them years, and we completed it in a little more than a week. We will provide the second part of the answers shortly. And we hope that Europe’s decision in response will be quick. The status of a candidate for membership in the European Union will open for us unprecedented opportunities in our history for the restoration and modernization of Ukraine. We are negotiating with countries at the bilateral level and with international financial institutions to support our country's reconstruction program. Of course, we will involve global business as much as possible. But we are primarily interested in creating jobs and added value in Ukraine. Therefore, localization will continue to be an important process for us. In the evening I signed a traditional decree on awarding our heroes. 192 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 24 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal glory to each of our defenders! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! The 55th day of our defense against Russia's full-scale aggression is coming to an end. At present, virtually the entire combat-ready part of the invaders’ army is concentrated on the territory of our state and in the border areas of Russia. They drove against Ukraine almost everyone and almost everything that can fight us. Therefore, in this confrontation, in this defense, before the eyes of the whole world, we are really opposing the army, which was considered the second or third in power. And the way our Armed Forces are holding on, the way our entire nation is boldly defending itself shows that the Ukrainian army has long deserved to be higher than the Russian one in global rankings. If we had access to all the weapons we need, which our partners have and which are comparable to the weapons used by the Russian Federation, we would have already ended this war. We would have already restored peace and liberated our territory from the occupiers. Because the superiority of the Ukrainian military in tactics and wisdom is quite obvious. That is why I emphasize the simple truth in literally every contact with the leaders of the democratic world, in all negotiations, in all interviews - it is unfair that Ukraine is still forced to ask for what its partners have been storing somewhere for years. If they have the weapons that Ukraine needs here, needs now, if they have the ammunition that we need here and now, it is their moral duty first of all to help protect freedom. Help save the lives of thousands of Ukrainians. If we had received what we are getting now in the first week of the war, the benefit for Ukraine and for freedom in Europe would be greater, I am sure. And if we get what some partners plan to hand over to Ukraine in the coming weeks right now, it will save the lives of thousands of people. I hope that the partners will hear this thesis and understand that every day matters. Any delay in helping Ukraine gives the occupiers an opportunity to kill more Ukrainians. The intensity of fire by Russian troops in the Kharkiv direction, in Donbas and in the Dnipropetrovsk region has increased significantly. They still consider ordinary housing infrastructure normal targets for them. In this war, the Russian army will forever inscribe itself in world history as perhaps the most barbaric and inhuman army in the world. Purposefully killing civilians, destroying residential neighborhoods, civilian infrastructure, using all kinds of weapons for this, including those prohibited by international conventions, is the signature of the Russian army. And this is vileness, which will mark the Russian state as a source of absolute evil for generations. And when a special tribunal is set up to convict all those guilty of war crimes, a Russian passport will mean only one thing in any country: unequivocal condemnation from all decent people, unequivocal unwillingness to cooperate. The situation in Mariupol remains unchanged - as severe as possible. The Russian army is blocking any efforts to organize humanitarian corridors and save our people. The occupiers are trying to carry out deportation or even mobilization of the local residents who have fallen into their hands. The fate of at least tens of thousands of Mariupol residents who were previously relocated to Russian-controlled territory is unknown. Unfortunately, we do not hear a response from Russia to the exchange offer, which could save the civilians and defenders of Mariupol. And this silence should be noted by all who have been or may be associated with Russia. When your fate is decided, Moscow will be silent. This is illustrative. And this is the best argument not to have contacts with the Russian Federation. In the south of our country, the occupiers are trying to demonstrate at least something that can be presented in Russia as the alleged readiness of Ukrainians to cooperate with Russian structures. It looks pathetic. After 55 days of war, the occupiers didn't manage to attract anyone to their side except for some outcasts. The situation is quite clear - Ukrainians in all regions of our state support Ukrainian national unity. They support our national statehood. And I am grateful to all the residents of the temporarily occupied cities, temporarily occupied communities - Kherson, Kakhovka, Melitopol and all our other communities - for this clear position. No cooperation with the occupiers. No support for the collaborators. The more principled we are, the more principled you will be, the sooner normal life will return. I held a meeting with representatives of the Verkhovna Rada today. We discussed the plan of parliamentary work, agreed on important draft decisions for the state, which need to be adopted in the near future. In particular, the deputies were offered to support the technical decision to extend the martial law. This is necessary for the legal support of the defense of our state and the stable operation of all structures. We also discussed a bill on the procedure for deploying the capacities of the enterprises that were evacuated from the combat zone. A bill with amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine, which are necessary for cooperation with the International Criminal Court. A bill on the legal regime in the temporarily occupied territories. The conversation was substantive, and I hope that the deputies will work out these bills soon enough. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. Informed him about the current situation in the areas of hostilities and especially in Donbas. Expressed gratitude for the strong support for Ukraine. We coordinated the next steps needed to protect our state and freedom in Europe. Agreed to increase the supply of heavy weapons, including armored vehicles. I also spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In particular, on the defensive, financial and humanitarian needs of Ukraine. We are accelerating procedures so that Ukraine can move forward in European integration as fast as possible. Now, during the war, this movement and its speed are also elements of protection of our state, preservation of freedom for our people. More and more global companies are announcing the shutdown in Russia. Today, the German company Henkel has joined hundreds of other such large companies. I want to emphasize that this is inevitable: any normal business will have to make such a decision and leave Russia. Now the Russian state is at a level where any association with it and any support for it means complicity in mass killings. Complicity in what will be called crimes against humanity and genocide. Before delivering this address, I signed the traditional decree on awarding our defenders. 286 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 229 of them are servicemen of the 36th separate brigade of marines, which together with other units heroically defends Mariupol. Maximum gratitude from all the Ukrainian people to the 36th brigade, Azov, the 12th brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, border guards, Right Sector volunteers, the 555th military hospital, police officers and territorial defense. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for Mariupol, our entire state and the people of Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Free people of the bravest country! The 56th day of our defense is coming to an end, and today we have definitely become one step closer to peace. I was glad to welcome in Kyiv a great friend of our state and all Ukrainians - President of the European Council Charles Michel. Each such visit only underscores how absurd Russia's plans to seize our state were. Three days? Five days? In how many days the occupiers planned to take control of Ukraine? 56 days - and we are meeting our guests in our capital for the sake of our national interests. I held very thorough talks with Charles Michel on many aspects of relations between Ukraine and the European Union. The main thing is, of course, to protect our state and maintain the stable functioning of all state structures and all institutions. We discussed concrete steps of the European Union to help our country. In particular, defensive, financial and sanctions. The second major topic of the talks is our movement towards European integration. This is the historic moment when we can develop maximum speed in joining the European Union. We have already proved that the Ukrainian state and public institutions are effective enough to withstand even the test of war. We are already doing as much to protect freedom on the European continent as other nations have never done. And I see from all our friends in the European Union a willingness to help our movement as much as possible. I thanked Charles for that today. The third major topic of our talks is the preparation of the necessary steps for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. We also discussed what we can do together with the European Union to address the threats to food and energy security in Europe and around the world posed by Russia. Resuming exports of Ukrainian agricultural products and blocking Russia's ability to blackmail Europe with energy resources are top priorities for everyone on the continent. Before meeting with me, President Charles Michel visited Borodyanka, Kyiv region. He came there not alone, but together with his team. They saw with their own eyes what the occupiers had done on our land. What destruction they had caused. And a correct conclusion was made by our friends: there can be no peace without justice. We will do everything we can to bring to justice every Russian military and commander guilty of war crimes. Modern technology allows you to clarify many details. Every surname, every home address, every bank account - we will find everything. A Plan to strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation for the war against our state was published today. This Plan was developed by a team of Ukrainian and international experts led by Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul. When all the key areas identified in this Plan are implemented, Russia will lose the opportunity to finance the military machine. In particular, the Plan provides for restrictions on Russia's energy sector, banking sector, export-import operations, transport. The next steps should include an oil embargo and a complete restriction on oil supplies from Russia. We are also working to ensure that all - I emphasize - all Russian officials who support this shameful war receive a logical sanctions response from the democratic world. Russia must be recognized as a state - sponsor of terrorism, and the Russian Armed Forces must be recognized as a terrorist organization. The European Union is currently preparing a sixth package of sanctions. We discussed this today with Charles Michel. We are working to make it truly painful for the Russian military machine and the Russian state as a whole. I emphasize in all negotiations that sanctions are needed not as an end in themselves, but as a practical tool to motivate Russia to seek peace. It is important that the EU Delegation and the embassies of friendly countries resumed work in Kyiv. This is one of the signals needed to tell Russia that there is no alternative to peace. There is no alternative to ending the war and guaranteeing full security for Ukraine. The more diplomatic missions return to work in our capital, the stronger this important signal will be. Already 18 foreign missions are working in Kyiv in various formats. In particular, Italy, Iran, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, the Holy See, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, France, the Czech Republic, Estonia and others. The return to normal life of the liberated cities and communities of Ukraine continues. 934 settlements have already been liberated. Police resumed work in 435 settlements. Local self-government started working in 431 communities. The work of humanitarian headquarters was launched in 361 settlements. We are gradually restoring people's access to medical and educational services, to social protection bodies. We are restoring road infrastructure, electricity, gas and water supply. The biggest threats are mines and tripwire mines planted by the occupiers and shells that did not explode. It takes a lot of time, a lot of effort to neutralize them all. And I am grateful to all the specialists, all the rescuers who perform this important task. Once again, I urge our citizens returning to liberated communities to be very careful. Do not enter the territory that has not yet been inspected. Do not go into the woods yet. If you see anything resembling a mine or a tripwire mine, report it to the police and rescuers immediately. Do not delay or attempt to remove hazardous items yourself. The situation in the east and south of our country remains as severe as possible. The occupiers do not give up trying to gain at least some victory for themselves through a new large-scale offensive. At least something they can \"feed\" their propagandists with. And I am sincerely grateful to each of our defenders, to all the Armed Forces of Ukraine, to all our cities, to all our communities that are resisting the invaders. To those who hold on and with their struggle, without exaggeration, save our state. Mariupol, Avdiivka, Maryinka, Krasnohorivka, Toretsk, Velyka Novosilka, Zolote, Popasna, Izyum, Kharkiv, Hulyaipole, Mykolaiv, Vysokopillya, Snihurivka and dozens, dozens of other cities, dozens of other communities of the east, communities of the south of Ukraine, in the struggle for which the fate of our people and our freedom is being decided. We are doing more than the maximum to ensure the supply of weapons to our army. Every day, all our diplomats, all our representatives and I personally work 24\/7 through all possible channels - official and unofficial - to speed up the delivery of aid. And I am very pleased to say, with cautious optimism, that our partners started to understand our needs better. Understand what exactly we need. And when exactly we need all this. Not in weeks, not in a month, but immediately. Right now, as Russia is trying to intensify its attacks. Traditionally, before delivering the address, I signed a decree awarding our defenders. 203 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 49 of them posthumously. Five of our servicemen were posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to all who stood up for our state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President of the Assembly! Dear Mr. President! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies! The people of Portugal! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you at such a time, the darkest time for our state. Yesterday, in the town of Borodyanka near our capital, two more graves of civilians killed by the Russian occupiers were found. In one of these graves there are the bodies of two 35-year-old men and a 15-year-old girl. In the second grave there are six people: four men and two women. They were killed when Russian troops controlled Borodyanka. The bodies were buried in the middle of the town, near ordinary houses. Such burials are found in all communities now, in all the cities we liberate from the Russian occupiers. The world has already remembered the name of the Ukrainian city of Bucha, which is a 20-minute drive from Borodyanka. It remembered the horrible photos of the bodies of those killed just on the streets of Bucha. For weeks, the murdered people have laid on the road, on the sidewalks, near houses. Russian soldiers did not even try to remove these corpses. And they did not allow, by the way, local residents who remained in the city to bury them. I'm sure most of you have seen those photos. But in these photos it is far from everything the locals had to go through. The occupiers killed people even for fun and to loot their houses. People were thrown to die in the well. Tortured. Executed. Grenades were thrown into the basements where people were hiding from shelling. The Russian military killed refugees on the roads. They opened fire on cars with the word \"Children\" written on them. Hundreds of such riddled and burned cars remained on the roads... In the Kyiv region alone - and this is as of today, because not all burials have been found yet - the occupiers killed 1,126 Ukrainians. 40 of them are children. In the Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and other regions of Ukraine, where Russian troops entered, they caused the same hell as in Borodyanka or Bucha. Just one example. In the village of Yahidne in the Chernihiv region, the occupiers drove all the villagers into the basement of the school and kept them there for weeks. This is a small village school, a small basement in which about 10 people died of suffocation alone. The youngest child in the basement was 3 months old. Imagine a three month old baby! And the oldest person was 93 years old. And in total there were about 400 people in the basement! More than three weeks. Day and night they were forbidden to go out of the basement even to the toilet. And when people asked for clothes for children, the occupiers demanded that they sing the Russian national anthem. That's how the Russian military had fun. This is the impunity they felt. This is what is happening in Ukraine now. In 2022. We are fighting against Russian troops not just for our state. Not just for independence. But literally for the survival of our people. So that Ukrainians are not executed. So that Ukrainians are not tortured. So that Ukrainians are not raped. And so that Ukrainians are not deported to Russia. The Russian occupiers have already deported at least 500,000 our citizens from the territory they have occupied. It's like your two cities of Porto. Just imagine that. There were people - and now they are gone. 500 thousand people! This is deportation. This is what the worst totalitarian regimes of the past did. The deported Ukrainians are deprived of means of communication, everything is taken away from them, even documents. They are distributed to the remote regions of Russia. The occupiers set up special filtration camps to distribute people. Some of those who get there are simply killed. Girls are raped. Imagine what it's like when a girl escapes from such a Russian filtration camp, and when asked how she did it, she says Russian soldiers simply didn’t like her. Because if they had liked her, she would have been raped and then killed, like many others. During the 57 days of the full-scale war, we liberated about a thousand settlements of Ukraine, which were captured by Russia, by the invaders. However, the number of occupied cities and communities is much bigger. Russian troops do not stop shelling and bombing our cities. They are destroying residential areas, any civilian infrastructure that allows cities to maintain normal life. Food warehouses, schools, universities, hospitals, even churches are being blown up. More than 10 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes due to hostilities. Imagine this number. It's as if the whole of Portugal was forced to flee! I do not want to call these 10 million Ukrainians refugees. We use the term \"displaced persons\" to refer to them, these people. We hope that they will all be able to return home when it is safe. But when will it be? And what will be left of their house? Today, the Russian Defense Minister reported to the Russian leader on the hostilities against our city of Mariupol. You have all heard about Mariupol. Before the war, it was a city comparable in size to Lisbon. It was a half-million seaside city. Now it is completely destroyed. There is not a single undamaged building in Mariupol. Literally scorched city. For more than a month, the Russian troops have kept Mariupol under siege. Even humanitarian goods were not allowed. Hundreds of thousands of civilians were there without food, without water, without medicine. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing. Russian troops used aircraft to destroy even shelters and they knew for sure that there was no one there but civilians. Some Mariupol residents managed to escape, and for most of them nothing and no one was left at all. There aren't even photos of their pre-war life - everything was burned. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians died in the city during Russia's hostilities against Mariupol. We do not even know the exact number of the dead. And we may not find it out. Because Russian troops brought to the city so-called mobile crematoria - special machines for the destruction of human bodies. The occupiers drew conclusions from how the world reacted to the massacre in Bucha. And now the Russians are trying to hide the traces of war crimes. Ladies and Gentlemen! Portuguese people! When we turn to the nations of the free world for help, we say simple and clear things. We need weapons to protect ourselves from the brutal Russian invasion, which brought to our people as much evil as the Nazi invasion did 80 years ago. Leopard tanks, armored personnel carriers, Harpoon anti-ship missiles - you have them and you can help protect the freedom and civilization of Europe with them. Therefore, I appeal to your state to provide us with this assistance. We need increased pressure of sanctions on Russia, because only sanctions can force Russia to seek peace and deprive the Russian military machine of resources. We need the principled stance of European companies, so that all of them leave the Russian market, because their taxes, their excise taxes, which they pay to the Russian budget, support this evil. Why did Russia start the war? The capture of Ukraine is its first step in gaining control of Eastern Europe to destroy democracy in our region. Ukraine has been and remains the mainstay of democratic processes in our region. The two revolutions of 2004 and 2014, which stopped the dictatorship in Ukraine, in fact defended democracy not only for our nation, but also for all the nations of our region who want to freely choose the future, without any coercion - internal and external. And your people who will soon celebrate the anniversary of the Carnation Revolution, which freed you from the dictatorship, clearly understand our feelings. Exactly understands the feelings of all other nations of our region who seek freedom. What does Russia bring to Ukraine? Death and dictatorship. And after Ukraine it will try to bring all this to Moldova, Poland, Georgia, the Baltic states, Kazakhstan and all other countries it can reach. Russia can be stopped. Mass killings, deportation and dictatorship can be stopped. Now, in Ukraine. I am grateful to your government and to all the Portuguese people for the assistance to Ukraine you have already provided. For supporting sanctions against Russia. And it is important now, when the European Union is preparing the sixth package of sanctions, that you show your leadership and defend the need for an oil embargo against Russia at the European level. It is also important that you, along with other EU countries, insist on a complete restriction of the Russian banking system. We need to close all EU ports, all Portuguese ports for Russian ships. In particular, for those that they are trying to hide under other countries’ flags. I am grateful to you for supporting our people, Ukrainian displaced persons. The Ukrainian and Portuguese people know each other well. They understand each other well. And it is important that you use your opportunities, both in Europe and in other macro-regions of the world, to protect the freedom and right to life of our people. You can tell the truth about this Russian invasion, about this war against the Ukrainian people, both in South America and in Africa. I ask you to fight Russian propaganda and Russian corrupt influence in the countries that are close to you. And I believe that the people of Portugal, and with them the Portuguese politicians, will support our state in its fundamental desire to be with you in the European Union. The free must support the free. The decent must support the decent. The conscientious must support the conscientious. And I believe that you will not betray us or yourself. Because Ukraine is already on its way to the European Union under an accelerated procedure. We hope that in the near future we will be able to obtain the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union. And when the decision is considered, I ask you to support full membership for Ukraine. Because you on the western edge of Europe and we on the eastern edge of Europe have the same values, the same view of what life should be like on our continent. Freedom, human rights, the rule of law, equality for every man, for every woman and the opportunity to live freely and without any dictatorship, so that everyone always has the time for happiness and for saudade. Thank you, Portugal! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President David Malpass! Dear Mrs. Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva! Dear ladies and gentlemen, ministers! Greetings to all present at this historic World Bank session and thank you for the opportunity to address you today. This Sunday I spoke with Mrs. Kristalina Georgieva and heard very important words from her. Words about our state - about Ukraine. We talked with her in particular about life in our city of Kharkiv. It is the largest city in the east of Ukraine. Russian troops have been shelling and bombing it for weeks. In those parts of the city where Russian weapons reach, more than a thousand houses have already been destroyed. Russian artillery, Russian missiles, Russian air bombs do not choose who to kill and which buildings to blow up and burn. It is equally dangerous both in the center of Kharkiv and on the outskirts. You can die from Russian shelling everywhere. But you need to know the people of Kharkiv. You need to know our people... Even during the war, during such shelling, Kharkiv remains a fully functioning city. Mrs. Kristalina especially noted that in Kharkiv, despite everything, flowers are planted, trees are cultivated, the streets are cleaned now, and the city is generally tidy. That’s what our Kharkiv is like. That’s what our people are like. That’s what our Ukraine is like. We managed to liberate from the occupiers the cities and communities of three northern regions of Ukraine - Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy. We immediately do everything to restore normal life there. Russian troops have destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of houses in these regions. Almost all social facilities, most of the economically important enterprises of Ukraine have been burned or need to be repaired. Thousands of people were killed. We restore electricity, communications, we restore water supply. We restore traffic, set up temporary bridges across rivers instead of destroyed ones. We return social and administrative services. We carry out demining. Several thousand explosive devices are neutralized daily. These are mines, tripwire mines and shells left over from the Russian military. Imagine, they mined even ordinary people's homes. Home appliances that they failed to steal and take away. Cars. Basements. They even mined agricultural fields... But even in such conditions, our people return home. Ukrainians are already trying to do everything to restore normal life. Because that's who we are, Ukrainians. In the east of our state, in Donbas, in the south the situation is even worse. And right now active hostilities are still going on there. Russia is still trying to develop a new brutal offensive there... I will cite only one figure now so that you can understand the scale of Ukraine's ordeal, our people's ordeal. Due to the bombing and shelling by Russian troops in Ukraine, 1,141 educational institutions were destroyed or damaged. Schools, kindergartens, universities. All over our country! Not every country in the world has as many educational institutions as destroyed by Russian troops in Ukraine. And if so many educational institutions were destroyed, you can imagine how much else was destroyed. Hospitals, infrastructure, businesses and ordinary houses. The Russian invasion completely destroyed normal economic relations. The first loss analysis alone yielded approximately $ 550 billion in losses. Russia has blocked our ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. This has significantly reduced Ukrainian exports, including agricultural products. Due to the shortage of Ukrainian food on the world market, the beginning of the crisis is already being felt. A recent report by the UN World Food Program stated that rising food prices this year would lead to starvation of about 47 million people in 81 countries. Without Ukrainian wheat, corn, vegetable oil and other commodities, this will result not only in physical food shortages in many countries in Africa and Asia, but also in political instability and possibly a new migration crisis. People will look for the culprits of this crisis, in particular, taking to the squares in their countries, in their cities. People will look for ways to escape. Of course, we do our best to export our products. We launched a sowing campaign this year - as much as possible. But no one in the world can be sure that food security can be guaranteed as long as this war continues - Russia's war on our land. Stopping the war now and liberating our territory from Russian invaders is the only reliable way to stop the food crisis. The Russian troops are deliberately destroying all facilities in our country that could provide an economic basis for life. Railway stations, food warehouses, bakery plants, oil terminals, etc... As of now, given the economic downturn and broken economic ties, we need up to $ 7 billion in financial support each month. Ukraine will need hundreds of billions of dollars to recover from this war. I'm sure each of you has these calculations, I'm sure of it. We must also honestly say that Russia is accompanying this war against us with aggressive measures on world markets. They specifically create such conditions that there is instability not only in the food market, but also in the fuel market and in the raw materials markets in general. Russia has provoked rising energy prices in Europe and more broadly in the democratic world. With sufficient export potential, they have constantly held back gas, in particular, to create painful price conditions for European consumers. So that people put pressure on their governments in the middle of the state for the sake of Russia's political interests. This and many other similar examples show that Russia can no longer be considered a normal and reliable supplier of energy resources, a normal and reliable trading partner. Together we are able to implement solutions that will not only stop the aggressive intentions of the Russian Federation, not only support Ukraine in this war, but also inevitably show all the potential aggressors of the world that creating problems for other states, for other nations means creating problems for themselves. Because if we do not do this, millions and millions of people in the world will repeatedly suffer from the aggressive actions of individual states. So, what steps are needed now? The first is immediate support for Ukraine, so that the Russian leadership knows that the war will not allow them to realize any of their aggressive goals. I am sure that our Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, who are present at this meeting, will talk about the details of such financial support. We must do everything to ensure that Ukraine and Ukrainians have everything they need to live despite the war. In Kharkiv, which I mentioned at the beginning of this speech, and in all other cities and communities of Ukraine. Everywhere. Second, Russia must be immediately excluded from all international financial institutions. The IMF, the World Bank and others are definitely not the place for a state that is trying to ruin the lives of its neighbors. Third, we need a special tax for the war. Russia, and after it any other aggressor, must pay for violating global stability. Such a tax for the war should be imposed on all, without exception, trade transactions with Russia as a state or with Russian companies. On all export-import transactions, all financial transactions that have not yet been blocked. Funds from the war tax should be used to help Ukraine rebuild everything that Russia destroyed in the war. Or, if this tax is applied to another aggressor, the funds should be directed to the victim of that war. The world needs an effective tool to respond to the destructive actions of those who do not want to maintain common security and work for the common good of all in the world. I am convinced that a special tax for the war can become such a tool. Fourth, every country in the world needs to prepare now for the possible complete severance of any relations with Russia. No one should depend on the political mood of the leadership of this state. If the world is ready to isolate Russia completely, the Russian leadership will have a motive to avoid any war. And fifth, significant assets of the Russian state and representatives of the Russian elite have already been blocked. However, these are not all their assets that we are aware of. This blocking work must be continued. And not just as an end in itself. Russia's blocked funds must be used both to rebuild Ukraine after the war and to compensate for the damage that Russia has caused to other nations with its destructive behavior. If because of the war unleashed by Russia famine starts in certain regions, or if some countries are substantially affected by inflation, blocked Russian assets could be used to pay for aid and compensation. We must use all our strength to make Russia feel punishment for this war. And feel how great the need to restore peace is - including for Russia itself. So by helping us, you can help yourself as well. Stabilize the financial situation in our region and in the world in general. Ensure security in key markets, starting with food. With your financial support and decisions, we will quickly rebuild our state. And this means not only new opportunities for business from different countries, not only new opportunities for economic growth, but also concrete evidence that global financial institutions are able to work in the interests of ordinary people, in the interests of humanity as a whole. I want one of the next such meetings to take place in Ukraine. In one of our cities - maybe in Kharkiv - with your support. Thank you very much for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today was a very meaningful foreign policy day for Ukraine. First, the Prime Ministers of Spain and Denmark, two countries that have consistently supported Ukraine, have arrived in Kyiv. Thank you. The two leaders whose presence in Kyiv encourages other leaders of the democratic world to think about visits to Ukraine, about new gestures of support for our state, about concrete decisions that we need to win. I thanked them for helping our defense. For sanctions pressure on Russia. I called on Spain, Denmark and all other European democracies to further strengthen sanctions for this war. To finally impose an oil embargo, to disconnect the entire banking system of Russia from the global financial system. And to help us bring to justice all those guilty of war crimes against Ukrainians. The Prime Minister of Denmark stated readiness to support the program of post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, in particular the reconstruction and development of Mykolaiv and the shipbuilding industry of Ukraine. Let me remind you that this is the direction of reconstruction I proposed when addressing the Parliament and the people of Denmark in March. And today I addressed the Parliament and the people of Portugal. This was the 26th address to the parliaments of our partner states. I can say that each of these speeches really gives us additional support. Brings the decision to provide assistance to Ukraine, including defensive one, closer. And most importantly, each of these addresses helps establish a direct emotional connection between what we are experiencing in Ukraine and what the political class is experiencing in the partner countries. I also addressed the participants of the special spring session of the World Bank today. This is one of the most important events for the heads of international financial institutions and finance ministers of leading states. We are accumulating financial support for Ukraine. The United States has announced a new package of support for our state. We are grateful for that. This package contains very powerful defense tools for our military. In particular, it is artillery, shells, drones. This is what we expected. I am grateful to the partners for their help and call for further acceleration of the supply of weapons to Ukraine so that we can bring peace closer. In the south and east of our country, the occupiers continue to do everything to have a reason to talk about at least some victories. They are accumulating forces, driving new battalion tactical groups to our land. They are even trying to start the so-called mobilization in the occupied regions of Ukraine. None of these steps will help Russia in the war against our state. They can only delay the inevitable - the time when the invaders will have to leave our territory. In particular Mariupol. A city that continues to resist Russia. Despite everything the occupiers say. I urge the residents of the southern regions of Ukraine - Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions - to be very careful about what information you provide to the invaders. And if they ask you to fill out some questionnaires, leave your passport data somewhere, you should know - this is not to help you. Not just to carry out a \"census\" of people who live in a certain area, as they say. No. And not to give you any humanitarian aid. This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land, if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show. And this is the reality. Be careful. I want to say straight away: any \"Kherson People's Republics\" are not going to fly. If someone wants a new annexation, it can only lead to new powerful sanctions strikes on Russia. You will make your country as poor as Russia hasn’t been since the 1917 civil war. So it is better to seek peace now. Unfortunately, Russia rejected the proposal to establish an Easter truce. This shows very well how the leaders of this state actually treat the Christian faith, one of the most joyful and important holidays. But we keep our hope. Hope for peace, hope that life will overcome death. Tomorrow is Good Friday for Eastern Christians. The most sorrowful day of the year. A day when everything you can do in life will weigh less than prayer. Except for one... defending the Homeland, defending brothers-in-arms in battle. A few minutes ago, before delivering this address, I signed another decree on awarding our heroes, our military. 202 defenders of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 194 servicemen of the Armed Forces and 8 servicemen of the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who defends the state! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 58th day of our defense is coming to an end. It ends on Good Friday, one of the most sorrowful days of the year for Christians. The day when death seems to have won. But... We hope for a resurrection. We believe in the victory of life over death. And we pray that death loses. This year, during the full-scale war, Russia's war against our state, these words have a special meaning for us. Russia brought death to Ukraine. After eight years of brutal war in Donbas, Russia wanted to destroy our state completely. Literally deprive Ukrainians of the right to life. But no matter how fierce the battles are, there is no chance for death to defeat life. Everyone knows that. Every Christian knows that. This is a basic element of our culture. Perhaps this does not exist in modern Russian culture anymore. Because in order to do everything they did to Ukrainians in our cities... you have to kill a human inside you. Because a human of any faith simply cannot do that. But for our culture, it all matters. And it will matter. And life will surely defeat death. I am grateful to our British friends for the important symbolic decision announced today to return the embassy to Kyiv. The United Kingdom became the twenty-first country to return a diplomatic mission to our capital. And this shows that we are not the only ones who believe in the victory of life over death. Today, with reference to the Russian military, the news was spread that their task now is allegedly to establish control over the south of Ukraine and reach the Moldovan border. And allegedly there, in Moldova, the rights of Russian-speakers are violated. Although, to be honest, the territory in which Russia should take care of the rights of Russian-speakers is Russia itself. Where there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of choice. Where there is simply no right to dissent. Where poverty thrives and where human life is worthless. To the extent that they come to us, go to war to steal at least something that resembles a normal life. You know they used to talk about their biggest dream: to see Paris and die. And their behavior is now just shocking. Because their dream now is to steal the toilet and die. Well, this only confirms what I have said many times: the Russian invasion of Ukraine was intended only as a beginning, then they want to capture other countries. Of course, we will defend ourselves as long as necessary to break this ambition of the Russian Federation. But all nations that, like us, believe in the victory of life over death must fight with us. They have to help us, because we are the first on this path. And who is next? If anyone who can become next wants to stay neutral today so as not to lose anything, this is the riskiest bet. Because you will lose everything. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to deter attacks by Russian invaders in the east and south of our country. The Izyum direction, Donbas, Pryazovia, Mariupol, Kherson region are the places where the fate of this war and the future of our state is being decided. In Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, in the Donetsk region in general, in Popasna and in the Luhansk region in general, in Kharkiv, in the surrounding areas, the occupiers are trying to achieve a primitive goal - to kill as much as possible and destroy everything they see. And I am grateful to each of our defenders who are bravely holding on, teaching the Russian army the idea that Russia's chances in this war may be less than Ukraine's. As every morning, as every day, as every evening, we have paid maximum attention today to provide our military with all the necessary weapons. This is the number one task for our state. And I am grateful to all our partners who finally heard us. Who provide us with exactly what we asked for. Because we know for sure that with these weapons we will be able to save the lives of thousands of people. And we will be able to show the occupiers that the day when they will be forced to leave Ukraine is approaching. The return to normal life in the territories liberated from the occupiers continues. If at the beginning of this week demining took place in 70 settlements, today 184 settlements have been demined. Of course, much remains to be done. But the pace, I think, is pretty good. Humanitarian headquarters are already operating in more than 500 de-occupied settlements. Almost 100 settlements are added daily, to which we return medical and educational services, the work of social protection bodies, financial institutions. We are restoring transport connections at a fairly fast pace. Plus 96 settlements today, where the transport connection was returned. Plus 183 settlements where gas stations have resumed work. Plus 90 settlements where electricity was restored. We return water supply, gas supply, mobile connection. The return of Ukraine to cities and communities means the return of life in the full sense of these words. I believe that such a return will take place in the south of our country and in the east of Ukraine. In all areas where degradation, destruction and death have been brought under the Russian flag. But it depends on how united we all will be in countering the Russian invasion. I emphasize once again that everyone should oppose the occupation at every opportunity. Ignore the occupiers. Do not cooperate with them. Don't help them. Neutralize collaborators. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are performing their tasks brilliantly. Intelligence, the National Guard, territorial defense, police, border guards - all of them work one hundred percent for the victory. But every citizen must also work for the victory - in what he does and where he is. If you are abroad - support Ukraine. If you are engaged in ordinary economic activities, do your best for the benefit of Ukraine as much as possible. If you found yourself in a temporarily occupied territory - try to cause the occupiers as much trouble as possible. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are our foundation. But a fortress of our national unity must always stand on this foundation. Unity of all Ukrainians who fight for life and against death. Against the Russian invasion. Traditionally, in the evening I signed a decree awarding our heroes. 48 defenders of Ukraine were awarded state awards. For courage in battles, for exemplary military service. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Today I will begin my evening address to you without greetings. Today Russia launched another missile strike at Ukraine, at Odesa. As of now - 8 dead. At least 18 wounded. Ordinary peaceful people. Among those killed was a 3-month-old baby girl. How did she threaten Russia? It seems that killing children is just a new national idea of the Russian Federation. The missiles were launched by Russian strategic aircraft. From the Caspian Sea region. We managed to shoot down two missiles. Five more missiles hit a peaceful city. Including the usual apartment house, the usual high-rise building. We will identify all those responsible for this strike. Those responsible for Russia's missile terror. Everyone who gives these orders. Everyone who fulfills these orders. No one will be able to hide. No matter how long it takes us, all these bastards will be responsible for every death they caused. Russia has already fired most of its missile arsenal at Ukraine. Of course, they still have missiles. Of course, they can still continue the missile terror against our people. But what they have already done is definitely arguments sufficient for the world to eventually recognize the Russian state as a sponsor of terrorism and the Russian army as a terrorist organization. We will continue to insist on this in negotiations with our partners. There is simply no alternative to such recognition. That is why it is true. The Russian state has become a terrorist, and it is not ashamed. And if it is not ashamed, it is deliberate. Therefore, there must be maximum responsibility. New facts about the crimes of the occupiers against our Mariupol residents are being revealed. New graves of people killed by the occupiers are being found. We are talking about tens of thousands of dead Mariupol residents. Negotiations of the occupiers on how they conceal the traces of their crimes are recorded. Russia continues the activities of so-called filtration camps, particularly near Mariupol. Although the honest name for them is, in fact, different - it's concentration camps. Like those built by the Nazis in the past. Ukrainians from these camps - the survivors - are sent further into the occupied territories and to Russia. The facts of deportation of our citizens to the Russian boondocks, to Siberia, even to Vladivostok are recorded. They also deport children hoping that they will forget where their home is and where they are from. And they are from Ukraine. Today was Holy Saturday for Christians of the Eastern Rite. The day between the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. It seems that Russia is stuck on such a day. For years. On the day when death triumphs and God is supposedly gone. But there will be a Resurrection. Life will defeat death. The truth will defeat any lies. And evil will be punished. And Russia will have to learn these truths again, it's only a matter of time. It is only a matter of time before all Russian murderers feel what a fair response to their crimes is. It is only a matter of time before we can bring all the deported Ukrainians home. It is only a matter of time before all our people all over Ukraine feel what a strong peace is. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. I informed him about the situation in Mariupol, in the areas of hostilities in general. I thanked him for the significant defensive and financial support for Ukraine. We coordinated further steps needed to protect our freedom. We are also preparing for tomorrow's important talks with American partners. I held a big live press conference in Kyiv today. Answered many questions - different, from different journalists. Both Ukrainian and foreign. And it's not just about openness, really. Not just about information. It's about whose side the truth is on in the war. This is about who can speak truthfully both with his people and with the whole world. Ukrainians can. Our enemies cannot. And finally. There will be a curfew tonight. Please follow this rule. This is important from a security point of view. But starting from 5 am you will be able to visit temples in your cities, towns and communities. Where it is possible to hold a church service. Please - only in the morning. I am grateful to each of our defenders who ensure our security this night before Easter and every day. Who defend the state. Who fight for the freedom of Ukrainians. Eternal glory to all our warriors! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Great people of great Ukraine! Today is a great holiday. And I'm in a great place. The Great St. Sophia Cathedral. In the cathedral, which was founded a thousand years ago, on the field of the sacred battle where the army of Kyivan Rus’-Ukraine defeated the Pechenegs. In the cathedral, which was not destroyed by the Horde invasion or the Nazi occupation, which withstood in spite of everything! Today we all believe in a new victory for Ukraine. And we are all convinced that we will not be destroyed by any horde or evil. We are enduring dark times. And on this bright day, most of us are not in bright clothes. But we are fighting for a bright idea. On the bright side. And the truth, people, the Lord and the holy heavenly light are on our side. The power of the patron saint of the human race - Oranta. She is above me. She is above us all. The unshakable pillar of the Church of Christ, the unbreakable wall of the main stronghold - Kyiv, the Unbreakable Wall of the State. As long as there is Oranta, there is Sophia, and Kyiv stands with her, and the whole of Ukraine stands with them! Above the image of Oranta are the words from the Psalms: “God dwells in that city; it cannot be destroyed. From the very break of day, God will protect it.\" On this Great Day, we all believe that our dawn is coming soon. Oranta in Latin means \"one who prays\". We have all been praying for the last two months. And in the Resurrection of Christ, which symbolizes the great victory of life over death, each of us asks the Lord for one thing. And speaks the same words to heaven. The words of a great and united prayer. Great and Only God! Save our Ukraine! Protect those who protect us! Heaven, protect those who defend the native land. Strengthen the will of those who protect us from captivity. Save those who save Ukraine. These are our military, national guards, border guards, our territorial defense, intelligence. These and all our other warriors of light. Help those who help them. These are volunteers and all people who care. From Ukraine and around the world. Give strength to all who give all their strength. May everyone who seeks always find. May everyone who is on the road always overcome it. And may everyone who does everything possible to save Ukraine never lose faith that everything is possible. Save the lives of those who save the lives of others. These are all our medics. Our firefighters, rescuers, sappers. May the victory of life be a symbol not only of this holiday. May life win the battle against death every day. Take care of our mothers. Give endurance to those who are waiting for a son or daughter from the war. Give fortitude to those who, unfortunately, have lost their children on the frontline. Help those who have lost their children in peaceful cities and villages where Russia has brought death to overcome unbearable pain. And give good health to all our mothers and all our grandmothers for many more years. To see their loved ones. To see peace and victory. To see justice. And the happy old age that the invaders are trying to steal from them. And instead of knitting scarves and sweaters for their grandchildren, today they weave camouflage nets. So give many years of peaceful life to them. And to our fathers. And to our grandfathers. Who once told their grandchildren about the war, and today send grandchildren to the war. Our fathers and our grandfathers built this country. Today they see it being destroyed. Let them see how our land will be liberated and rebuilt. And give us strength to do it. Take care of all our children. Give every boy and every girl a happy youth, maturity and old age, which will allow at least a little to get rid of the memories of their terrible childhood during the war. Not children's, scary games that they were forced to play. Hide and seek, but in the basement, from the bombs. Running, but from the gunshots. Travel, but because of the loss of home, fleeing the war. Save all Ukrainians! We did not attack anyone, so give us protection. We have never destroyed other nations, so do not let anyone destroy us. We did not seize other people's lands, so do not let anyone seize ours. Save Ukraine! Its right and left banks - at a time when we are being viciously beaten on both right and left cheeks. At the end of winter, spring did not come to us. Severe cold was brought to our house. At dawn we were brought opaque darkness. We believe, God, that in your judgment you will not forget them all. All those who have forgotten all your commandments. You will not forget about Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Hostomel. All those who survived brutal crimes. Give them and all our land human happiness. You will not forget about Chernihiv, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Sumy, Kharkiv, Izyum, Kramatorsk and Volnovakha, Popasna. All other towns and villages that hear the terrible explosions. Let them and all of us hear the fireworks of victory. You will not forget about Mariupol and its heroic defenders. One can destroy the walls, but can't destroy the foundation on which the morale stands. The morale of our warriors. The morale of the whole country. We see terrible scenes of war. Let us see a happy picture of peace. We are going through very difficult ordeals. Let us reach a just end on this path - the beginning of a happy life and prosperity of Ukraine! Our hearts are full of fierce fury. Our souls are full of fierce hatred for the invaders and all that they have done. Don't let fury destroy us from within. Turn it into our accomplishments from the outside. Turn it into a force of good to defeat the forces of evil. Save us from strife and division. Don't let us lose unity. Strengthen our will and our spirit. Don't let us lose ourselves. Don't let us lose our longing for freedom. Therefore, do not let us lose our zeal for a righteous struggle. Do not let us lose hope of victory and self-esteem, and therefore our freedom. And therefore Ukraine. And therefore faith. Dear Ukrainians! Last year we celebrated Easter at home because of the pandemic. This year we also celebrate the Resurrection of Christ not as we used to. Because of another virus. Because of the plague called war. Both last year's and the current threat are united by one thing - nothing can defeat Ukraine. The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win! And on Easter, we ask God for great grace to make our great dream come true - this is another great day - the day when great peace will come to Ukraine. And with it - eternal harmony and prosperity. With faith and confidence in this - I congratulate all of you on Easter. Take care of yourselves. Take care of your loved ones. Take care of Ukraine! Christ is Risen! He is Risen Indeed."

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Yesterday, Christians of the Eastern rite celebrated Easter. The traditional greeting \"Christ is risen!\" sounded also in Russia. But did these words mean the same thing as in the whole Orthodox world? Russia \"congratulated\" Ukraine on Easter with an air threat almost all over our country, a missile strike at the Poltava region, and a missile strike at Kremenchuk. Why was this attack needed at Easter? There is no military threat from which this could protect Russia. This is just a deliberate destruction of life in Ukraine. Destruction that did not stop even on the greatest Orthodox holiday. So are these people who continued to shell our cities and communities yesterday Christians? Who fired at Chuhuiv of the Kharkiv region. Who killed two more children in the Donetsk region on Easter - girls aged five and fourteen. Killing children, destroying lives, covering up with cynical and total lies what has been done against peaceful cities - all Russia is doing on the territory of Ukraine - is definitely not Christianity. This is what Christ opposed. People who once again refused to open humanitarian corridors from Mariupol are not Christians. People who filmed propaganda reports in the occupied regions of Ukraine about the distribution of alleged humanitarian Easter kits are not Christians. Moreover, everyone knows, including in Russia, that before February 24, all Ukrainians in all parts of Ukraine had the opportunity to celebrate Easter freely in any church and without any \"humanitarian\" kits. People who are trying to build a brutal occupation regime in the seized districts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, holding people hostage, torturing people are not Christians. Those who did not allow people to leave the occupied territory even on Easter, threatening them with death. Russia was offered an Easter ceasefire. But the Orthodox world has seen that for the Russian invaders Easter means nothing. For them, it is just a red date in the calendar, which requires special words, special behavior, but not what is called faith, and not what is called Christian good. The Russian army has made this Easter red not only formally in the calendar, but also red with blood. Christians would not do that if they had the opportunity to make peace. So holding a candle in the temple does not mean being a Christian. Eating or even celebrating Easter every year is not enough to be human, to be a Christian. And I am grateful to all our police officers, to all employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, to all those who were responsible for security on Easter, for not allowing any provocations yesterday. All that Russian propagandists announced recently. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are deterring attacks by Russian troops in key areas. In the Kharkiv region - in the Izyum direction, in Donbas - especially near Popasna, in Mariupol where the resistance of the city's defenders continues, in the southern areas, where the occupiers are trying to go on the offensive. Air alarms this morning were heard again almost all over our country. Vinnytsia, Rivne, Lviv, Odesa regions - missile threat. Russia does not stop trying to break our resistance to... Achieve what? In the occupied areas, either a humanitarian catastrophe has already occurred or there is very little time left before it occurs. There is a lack of basic products, there is a lack of medicines. People do not have the means to live normally, there is no basic security. They don’t have everything they had before February 24. What Donetsk and Luhansk had before 2014. Everything that we will definitely return after the liberation of our land. We continue to do everything to drive the occupiers out and restore peace to all our people. A key element of this process is the strength of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Availability of sufficient quantity and quality of weapons, sufficient quantity and quality of ammunition. Assistance to Ukraine was the number one issue in talks with representatives of the United States of America who arrived in Kyiv yesterday - Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Our talks with them were long enough - more than three hours - and meaningful. Encouraging and, which is important, effective. I am grateful to the people of the United States and personally to President Biden for the strong and sincere support we receive. These are real things that strengthen not only our state, but democracy as a whole. We share the same understanding with the United States: when democracy wins in one country, it wins all over the world. When freedom is defended in one country, it is defended all over the world. We agreed with the American side on further steps to strengthen the Armed Forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army. This includes preparations for a major ministerial meeting in Germany on Tuesday, which will bring together forty defense ministers from partner countries. The key issue is the protection of Ukraine, the protection of freedom in Eastern Europe. Ways to strengthen sanctions were discussed. The fact that Russia is not looking for peace and is demonstratively killing even on Easter shows that greater sanctions pressure is needed. It is necessary to block all opportunities for Russia to circumvent sanctions. So we handed over to our partners a special Plan to strengthen sanctions on the Russian Federation developed by an international expert group led by Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul. A separate point of the negotiations was financial support for Ukraine. When tyranny has enormous financial resources from oil and gas exports, the issue of financial support for freedom becomes vital. I heard a full understanding of this position from American friends. Not only in the context of helping Ukraine now, during the war, but also for the post-war reconstruction. Discussions on security guarantees for Ukraine continued. I am convinced that the United States can be a leader among the future countries - guarantors of Ukraine's security. The main goal for all of us is to make Europe and the world safer after the war, to ensure that the security architecture works in the event of any new threats. I was pleased to hear from our friends that the United States Embassy will be back in Kyiv in the near future. The appointment of a new US Ambassador to Ukraine will also take place. This is a very useful gesture of support for our state. I had an important conversation with Turkish President Erdoğan. On the situation in Mariupol and the need to evacuate civilians and the wounded, the need for immediate exchange of the blocked Ukrainian military. We discussed the negotiation process with Russia and the issues of defense. The threats to the world food market provoked by Russia, which has blocked our Black Sea ports, were also discussed in detail. Rising food prices have already reached critical levels in many countries. But this is just the beginning. If Russia does not seek peace, the issue of food security in many countries will become a matter of physical survival for millions of people and, consequently, stability of state systems. More and more political leaders around the world are aware of this threat. So we expect more pressure on Russia. I congratulated President of France Macron on winning the elections. We spoke with Mr. President at night. Ukraine will always appreciate his support, and will always be grateful for the help of France. I am convinced that together with France, together with President Macron, we will be able to do much more to protect our common freedom, our united Europe. Late last night, after all foreign policy issues, I signed important decrees to award our heroes. 188 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and five employees of the Security Service of Ukraine were awarded state awards of Ukraine. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Chayuk Denys Valentynovych, deputy commander of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade, for personal courage and effectiveness in battles with the occupiers, for destroying enemy equipment and manpower. Glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Unbreakable people of the bravest country in the world! Today the third month of our war for our independence began. Russian-Ukrainian war. The third month! On February 24, most in the world did not even believe that we would withstand more than a week. Someone said - three days. A month ago, we still had to convince different countries that betting on Ukraine means winning. And now... Now everyone knows it. Thanks to the courage, wisdom of our defenders, thanks to the courage of all Ukrainian men, all Ukrainian women our state is a real symbol of struggle for freedom. Everyone in the world - and even those who do not openly support us - agree that it is in Ukraine that the fate of Europe, the fate of global security, the fate of the democratic system is being decided. And above all, it is being decided what life in the center and east of our continent will be like and whether there will be life at all. Bucha, Borodyanka, Hostomel, Okhtyrka, Chernihiv and Sumy, Izyum, Kharkiv, Volnovakha, Zolote, Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Popasna and Mariupol... Missiles aimed at Odesa and Kramatorsk, Zhytomyr, Lviv, Kremenchuk and Kryvyi Rih... In all Ukraine's cities and communities, Russia has shown what it really wants and can bring to Europe. What it can bring to Chișinău, Tbilisi, Helsinki, Vilnius, Warsaw, Prague, all the cities and countries that Russian state propagandists have long openly identified as alleged enemies for Moscow. Russia has launched an offensive against Ukraine in many directions. Missile strikes, air raids, artillery, tanks - everything! Russian troops did not spare anything, any means to kill us, kill Ukrainians and destroy our land. In two months, they used more than 1100 missiles against us. Countless bombs and artillery. They tortured, robbed, executed. They mined our land. Peaceful cities and villages were turned into hell. Some Ukrainian cities and communities were destroyed to the ground. But they did not achieve anything. And they will not achieve. Kherson, Kakhovka, Melitopol, Dniprorudne, Enerhodar and our other cities where the Russian occupiers temporarily entered didn’t obey them. People showed with their protest their attitude towards the occupiers, showed that Ukraine will definitely win. Russia wants to play a sham \"referendum\" somewhere on our land? Even if they try, it will be as shameful as everything else that was \"created\" in Moscow for the occupation of Ukraine. Kharkiv region, Donetsk, Luhansk - the Russian military didn’t see even the slightest support they had hoped for anywhere. But they saw that it is a completely different state. They saw that there are completely different people here. People who are confident. Who believe in their state. Who know how to respect others because they respect themselves. Who do not want to capture someone else’s land, but will not give anything of their own. Who will protect every city, every street, every field. In two months of hostilities 9 thousand 781 defenders of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to 142 of our defenders. Ukrainian men and women have shown a truly massive readiness to defend Ukraine. At any age, any property status, with any education - Ukrainian men and women equally stood up for the state. This war has truly become a people’s war for Ukraine. And it showed that throughout our territory - from east to west, from north to south - the Ukrainian idea is equally strong, equally national. As of this time, 931 settlements have already been de-occupied. Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army. But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land. Russia can spend enormous resources to support the war. To oppose even the whole free world. It can take away from its people everything that could develop Russia itself, and direct this potential to destroy the lives of neighbors. But the lessons of history are well known. If you are going to build a millennial Reich, you lose. If you are going to destroy the neighbors, you lose. If you want to restore the old empire, you lose. And if you go against the Ukrainians, you lose. A global anti-war coalition was formed in two months. Sanctions have already been imposed on Russia, which have taken away its future. Ukraine receives assistance from dozens of countries. This is support in the form of weapons, finances, necessary goods, political support directly. We are accelerating our movement to the European Union as much as possible. We have already passed a historic moment, an important stage - with the receipt and answering a special questionnaire, which was provided to each country before they acquired the status of a candidate for EU membership. Even now, when the war is still going on, we are creating the necessary base for the reconstruction of Ukraine. These are international agreements of various levels, this is the creation of special funds for the reconstruction of our state. Even now, when Russia is still trying to seize our territory, we are demonstrating that we will give free Ukraine more opportunities for development than Russia can give not only to the occupied part of our territory, but also to its own territory, its own state. It is obvious that every day - and especially today, when the third month of our resistance has begun - everyone in Ukraine is concerned about peace. About when all this will be over. About when and what can be a victory for Ukraine. There is and at the same time there is no simple answer to this question. When we gain a victory, everyone will feel it. When peace comes, everyone will see it. But for this to happen - and happen faster - we need to think not about when and what it will be. We must think every day about how to make the stay of the occupiers on our land even more unbearable. Ukraine is ready for peace. It was ready even when the war was going on in Donbas. It is ready even now, when the Russian invasion has become full-scale. But for Russia to seek peace, every Ukrainian must still fight. They must defend freedom. Because every day of struggle now adds years of peaceful life after this war. After our victory. As always, before delivering the address, I signed decrees awarding our heroes. 269 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 9 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate were awarded state awards. Eternal glory to all who stood up for the state! Eternal gratitude to all who help us endure! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Every year on April 26, the world remembers the Chornobyl disaster. The worst nuclear disaster in human history. But this year it is not enough to just remember Chornobyl. And it is not enough to say traditional words of gratitude to the heroes-liquidators. It is not enough to remind why and how the catastrophe became possible. It is not enough to repeat the conclusions that every intelligent person and every adequate society must draw. Because this year, Russia has created new threats that could surpass even the worst accident. I remember the night of March 4, when it became known about the fire at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. When Russian tanks fired at the station. They knew exactly which object they were firing at. But they had an order to seize the object at any cost. They did not care about anything. They did not care that the Zaporizhzhia station is the largest in Europe. They didn't think about how many power units there are and how the shelling could end. That night I spoke with world leaders. With everyone who could influence the events and stop Russia. I spoke with President Biden, with Chancellor Scholz, with President of the European Council Charles Michel, with President of Poland Andrzej Duda... I spoke with IAEA Director General Mr. Grossi. If the world had not woken up that night, we would not mention Chornobyl today, because everyone would think about what Russia has done at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is even surprising how quickly and completely Russia, the whole country, can forget about the worst catastrophe that its people have experienced as well. Not only Ukrainians were involved in the liquidation of the consequences of the Chornobyl accident in 1986. But also Belarusians, Russians and others. That catastrophe should have been told about in Russian schools as well. They should have reminded about it in Russia every year on April 26, as is done throughout the civilized world. Instead, today they launched three missiles against Ukraine so that they flew directly over the blocks of our nuclear power plants. Over three nuclear power plants at once. Over Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and South-Ukrainian NPPs. What is it? Are they threatening? Are they targeting? There are no words... It turns out they do not realize what Chornobyl is. At all. Russian troops that were trying to attack Kyiv through the Chornobyl zone used the restricted area as a military base. They set up positions on land where it is forbidden to even stand. They drove armored vehicles through areas where radiation-contaminated materials are buried and where the number of radioactive particles is simply horrendous. They destroyed the dosimetric control points. The Chornobyl radiation monitoring system was broken and looted. They looted a nuclear analytical laboratory... They even stole contaminated items, which were confiscated from violators of the rules of the Exclusion Zone! Only thanks to the professionalism and conscientiousness of our specialists working at the Chornobyl station and other facilities of the Chornobyl zone, we managed to save Ukraine, save Europe from a new catastrophe. Only thanks to the professional team of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and our entire nuclear industry is it possible to ensure trouble-free operation of stations during the war. Mr. Grossi, Director General of the IAEA, paid a visit to Kyiv today. We discussed all the dangers created by Russia and ways to possibly influence the situation to protect Europe and the world from completely irresponsible actions of the Russian Federation. Today, I also awarded our heroes - shift workers at the Chornobyl station who did not leave the facility. Who maintained the work of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant despite the threat to their lives and despite the occupiers' lack of understanding of even the basics of radiation safety. I believe that after all that the Russian military has done in the Chornobyl zone and at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, no one in the world can feel safe knowing how many nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons and related technologies the Russian state has. If Russia has forgotten what Chornobyl is, it means that global control over Russia's nuclear facilities and nuclear technology is needed. I spoke today with the Prime Minister of Japan. In particular, about the dangers created by Russia. About the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine. I thanked Japan for a strong package of sanctions, for its support and for the leadership needed to force Russia to peace and recognition of the foundations of international law. We also discussed the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine and the possible role of Japan in future security agreements. The Prime Minister of Romania paid a visit to Kyiv. I thanked him for the defensive and political support. We discussed not only bilateral cooperation between our states and joint work to protect freedom in Europe, but also cooperation at the EU level. With Romania, we share a common vision of both prospects and threats to European unity, in particular in the Black Sea region. We agreed to work together even harder to ensure security in our region. An important meeting at the level of defense ministers of Ukraine's partner countries took place in Germany today. The key issue was to strengthen the protection of the whole of Europe from Russia's aggressive ambitions. There are almost no people left in the free world who do not understand that Russia's war against Ukraine is just the beginning. The ultimate goal of Russia's leadership is not just to seize the territory of Ukraine, but to dismember the entire center and east of Europe and deal a global blow to democracy. Therefore, the free world has the right to self-defense. And that is why it will help Ukraine even more. I am grateful to the United Kingdom and personally to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his prompt and positive response to our request for trade liberalization. Right now it is especially important for the support of our state. Britain has announced the abolition of all duties and quotas on imports of Ukrainian goods. This will allow us to save thousands of jobs during the war and ensure a significant intensification of economic relations with Britain. We expect similar decision from other partners. I want to emphasize that this is important not only for our country, not only for each of the partner countries. This adds stability to global markets, especially the food market, which is one step away from a large-scale price crisis due to Russia's war against Ukraine. There is only one way to avoid the crisis: to strengthen cooperation and put pressure on Russia for it to give up this war. Today, Russian troops continued missile strikes at our land, particularly in the Odesa region. They continued to attack our troops near Kharkiv, in Donbas. They are trying to portray an alleged \"new government\" in Kherson and part of the Zaporizhzhia region. They change flags, demonstrate some suicides in the role of collaborators. And what does this give Russia? Only new losses. There will be a new sanctions package from the European Union. There will be even more restrictions on trade. Inevitably, the vast majority of the world's countries will abandon Russian oil and other Russian energy sources. No adequate country will want to invite Rosatom to cooperate. Most Russians will have to pay with poverty for the aggressive policy of their country's leadership. And I emphasize: we will identify, find and prosecute everyone - war criminals and collaborators. The longer and more brutal this war, the more resources will be spent not only by us, but also by the world to establish justice and punish all those responsible. The time will come when Russia will have to recognize that peace is needed. I paid a visit to Ilya Matvienko and Kira Obedinska in Okhmatdyt Hospital today. Kira is 12 years old, and Ilya turned 10 today. They lived in Mariupol until the Russian army came. Ilya's mother was killed during the bombing of the city. Kira's father, a well-known athlete and former captain of Ukraine's water polo team, Yevhen Obedinsky, was killed by a sniper. The occupiers took the children out of the city, actually abducted them, and it took a lot of effort to get them back. I am grateful to everyone who joined this cause. I am especially grateful to Iryna Vereshchuk and Andriy Yermak, who coordinated this task, to our entire team. Now Ilya is with his grandmother, Kira is with her grandfather. Their only relatives left. We will help them with everything they need. We will help raise children. And we will definitely do everything to return all our Ukrainian children to Ukraine. Let no one in Russia hope that Ukraine will forget or forgive the abduction of our children, the deportation of our citizens. And the destruction of Mariupol. I also thanked Okhmatdyt's doctors for their work. For saving lives and trying to restore children's peace of mind under all circumstances. Thank you very much, dear doctors. Before delivering the evening address, I traditionally signed a decree awarding our heroes. 243 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. Eternal gratitude to all our defenders! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Unbreakable people of the bravest country! The 63rd day of our defense is coming to an end. A day during which a lot has been done. First, an important decision of the European Union is being prepared. The European Commission has agreed to remove all duties and quotas on Ukrainian exports for a year, as well as to suspend anti-dumping tariffs. I discussed the details of this proposal with President Ursula von der Leyen today. I am grateful to her personally and to all our European friends for this step. Right now, this will allow us to maintain the economic activity in Ukraine, our national production as much as possible. But this decision needs to be considered not only in the Ukrainian context. Sufficient export of our products to European and global markets will be a significant anti-crisis tool. Russia is trying to provoke a global price crisis. To start chaos in all basic markets and especially in the food market. Ukrainian exports will help stabilize markets. So it is beneficial not only for us, but also for all Europeans. For residents of all countries that can be affected by Russia's destructive ambitions. New partners' decisions to liberalize our exports are expected soon. We are also agreeing with the European Union on how to increase the potential of transport corridors on our western border. I spoke today with the President of Indonesia. In particular, on food security. I stressed that the threat of famine for millions of people in different countries will remain until Russia begins to seek peace with Ukraine. It is because of this war waged by Russia that dozens of states have found themselves in a situation where they cannot be sure of stability for their people. I am grateful to Indonesia for supporting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our state, for an honest and responsible position during the UN voting. I am also grateful for the invitation to take part in this year's G20 summit. A conversation took place with the Prime Minister of Italy. I thanked Mr. Draghi for the involvement in the investigation of crimes committed by the Russian military. I informed him about the situation in the combat zones. We appreciate Italy's support for truly effective sanctions that can end the war. This week, Russia's leadership launched a new series of energy blackmail of Europeans. The decision to cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria is another argument in favor of the fact that no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia. Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used. To blackmail Europeans politically. Or to strengthen Russia's military machine, which sees a united Europe as a target. Hence, the sooner everyone in Europe admits that it is inadmissible to depend on Russia in trade, the sooner it will be possible to guarantee stability in European markets. A meeting of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities took place today. The first meeting during the full-scale war. A set of issues was discussed. In particular, the reconstruction of our country. We are already working on all the details so that the post-war reconstruction project can be implemented quickly and most effectively. I stressed that we expect specific requests and proposals from local authorities. So that we can talk specifically with our partners, with the European Union, with international donors. Communities must provide all information about destroyed housing, all damaged objects. We discussed how and in what order to build, how to organize the purchase of ready housing. Our goal is not just to rebuild everything that was destroyed by the occupiers. But also to solve old problems with housing queues and so on. So that all servicemen, rescuers, policemen, all who work for the state are provided with their own housing. Today in Congress we heard the reports on the earliest possible provision of housing for IDPs. On the interaction between central and local authorities in the communities that are temporarily occupied. The issues of territorial defense development and coordination between local authorities and law enforcement agencies were discussed. Today I want to especially support Ukrainians in the south of our country. In Kherson, in all communities of the region, in the temporarily occupied districts of the Zaporizhzhia region. I am grateful to everyone who does not give up. Who protests. Who ignores the occupiers and shows those outcasts who have become collaborators that they have no future. The stronger our resistance now, the more rejection the occupiers will see, the sooner normal life will return to our land. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to beat the invaders throughout the territory where the fighting continues. I am grateful to each of our defenders who do everything for Russia to lose. Mariupol, Marinka, Popasna, Severodonetsk, Izyum, Rubizhne, Dniprorudne, Melitopol and all other cities and communities that are now at the epicenter of the struggle for Ukraine. That is where the fighting for the future of our people is taking place. Thank you to everyone who brings our victory closer! I have just signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 173 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards of Ukraine. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Lieutenant General Serhiy Ivanovych Nayev, Commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today we have significant news for our state, for our defense. First, the United States has prepared a new support package for Ukraine worth $ 33 billion. In particular, more than 20 billion can be allocated for defense. More than $ 8 billion is planned for economic support. Another $ 3 billion will be allocated for humanitarian aid. This is a very important step by the United States. And I am grateful to the American people and personally to President Biden for it. I hope that the Congress will quickly support this request for help to our state. President Biden rightly said today that this step is not cheap. But the negative consequences of Russia's aggression against Ukraine and against democracy are so large-scale for the whole world that, in comparison with them, this support from the United States is necessary. Together, we can certainly stop Russian aggression and reliably defend freedom in Europe. We are also working to direct the blocked assets of Russian individuals subject to sanctions and the Russian state to compensate Ukraine for this war and to restore normal life. The investigation into the crimes committed by the Russian military against our people is underway. Ukraine's position is absolutely clear - every Russian criminal must be and will be brought to justice. Whoever they are and wherever they hide, we will find them all and make them bear responsibility. The first ten Russian servicemen from the 64th motorized rifle brigade of the Russian Ground Forces who committed crimes against our people in Bucha, Kyiv region, received the status of suspects. Their surnames are known. It is established what they did. We know all the details about them and their actions. And we will find everyone. Just as we will find all the other Russian thugs who killed and tortured Ukrainians. Who tormented our people. Who destroyed houses and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. None of these bastards will avoid responsibility. However, some of them may not survive until trial and fair punishment. But for one reason only. This Russian brigade was relocated to the Kharkiv region. There they will get retribution from our military. Prime Minister of Bulgaria Kiril Petkov paid a visit to Kyiv today. We had very substantive and very warm negotiations with him. Bulgaria is one of those countries that reacted to Russia's aggression in a principled manner and quickly. I am grateful to both the Bulgarian government and the Bulgarian people for not delaying the support for our state. Defense, energy and transport issues were discussed with Mr. Petkov. Sanctions pressure on Russia, which is necessary for peace. We also discussed our cooperation at the EU level. A very important agreement is on the repair of our military equipment at the Bulgarian production facilities. Another issue we agreed on is the supply of Ukrainian electricity to Bulgaria and the use of the Trans-Balkan gas pipeline together with the Bulgarian side. I am grateful to Bulgaria for the opportunity to use the port of Varna to export our agricultural capacity. UN Secretary-General António Guterres was also in Ukraine today. It is very important that Mr. Secretary-General visited Borodyanka, Kyiv region. And saw with his own eyes what the Russian occupiers had done there. Hundreds of Ukrainian cities and hundreds of communities have experienced the same thing as Borodyanka and Bucha. The Russian army in Ukraine consciously and without any doubt trampled down everything on which the global order was based after World War II. The UN Charter, international conventions, declarations, the rights of people and states... Everything that should guarantee freedom and security in the world is simply destroyed by Russia's aggressive actions. So the key issue in the talks with the UN Secretary-General was how to stop Russian aggression. And this is not just a question of Ukraine, our fate. This is a question of the fate of the United Nations, the fate of international law, the fate of many nations - and not just Russia's neighbors who may become the next victims of Moscow's aggressive ambitions. Of course, during the negotiations we paid a lot of attention to saving our people from Mariupol. I believe that with the help of the UN it is possible to organize an evacuation mission. Ukraine is ready for these steps. But it is also necessary for the Russian side to consider this issue without cynicism and actually do what it says. Moscow claimed they had allegedly ceased fire in Mariupol. But the bombing of the defenders of the city continues. This is a war crime committed by the Russian military literally in front of the whole world. Russia's shelling of Mariupol did not stop even when the UN Secretary-General was holding negotiations in Moscow. And today, immediately after the end of our talks in Kyiv, Russian missiles flew into the city. Five missiles. And this says a lot about Russia's true attitude to global institutions. About the efforts of the Russian leadership to humiliate the UN and everything that the Organization represents. Therefore, it requires a strong response. Russian missile strikes at Ukraine - Kyiv, Fastiv, Odesa, and other cities - once again prove that we cannot let our guard down. We cannot think that the war is over. We still have to fight. We still have to drive the occupiers out. Today, the Russian army continued its offensive attempts in the east of our country, in Donbas. Tries to advance in the southern regions. The Armed Forces of Ukraine repel the invaders. And I am grateful to each of our defenders who are holding positions. We are doing everything to help our army, to provide the military with all the necessary weapons. Every time I contact my partners, I emphasize that weapons for Ukraine right now, the very types we ask for and just when we need them, are salvation not only for our people. This is salvation for all of you - for all of Europe. I am grateful to those partners who understand this. And who help convince others. Before delivering the evening address, I signed a decree awarding our heroes. 214 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 14 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave life for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who stood up for the state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Unbreakable people of the bravest country! The 65th day of our defense is coming to an end. We are beating the occupiers in all directions where they are trying to advance. The situation in the Kharkiv region is tough. But our military, our intelligence, have important tactical success. In Donbas, the occupiers are doing everything to destroy any life in this area. Constant brutal bombings, constant Russian strikes at infrastructure and residential areas show that Russia wants to make this area uninhabited. Therefore, the defense of our land, the protection of our people is literally a struggle for life. For Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Popasna, Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Marinka and all other cities and communities of Donbas, which Russian troops want to turn into ruins, absolutely everything is being decided in this war. Only if Ukraine withstands will they live. If the Russian invaders succeed in realizing their plans, at least in part, they will still have enough artillery and aircraft to destroy the entire Donbas. Just as they destroyed Mariupol. The city, which was one of the most developed in the region, is simply a Russian concentration camp in the middle of ruins. And the order of the occupiers in that part of Mariupol which they unfortunately still control differs insignificantly from what the Nazis did in the occupied territory of Eastern Europe. But the Russian troops manage to be even more cynical than the Nazis 80 years ago. At that time, the invaders did not say that it was the Mariupol residents and the defenders of the city who shelled and killed themselves. I am grateful to the United States, President Biden and Congress for an analogue of the famous Lend-Lease program, which will be very helpful in the fight against Russia, against the Russian invaders. Which helped a lot in the fight against the Nazis during World War II. I am sure that now the Lend-Lease will help Ukraine and the whole free world beat the ideological successors of the Nazis, who started a war against us on our land. Lend-Lease and other programs in support of Ukraine are concrete proof that freedom is still able to defend itself against tyranny. Today, the Government of Ukraine considered the issue of eliminating the deficit in the fuel market. Queues and rising prices at gas stations are seen in many regions of our country. The occupiers are deliberately destroying the infrastructure for the production, supply and storage of fuel. Russia has also blocked our ports, so there are no immediate solutions to replenish the deficit. But government officials promise that within a week, maximum two, a system of fuel supply to Ukraine will be provided that will be able to prevent a deficit. This is a difficult task after the Russian missile strike at the Kremenchuk refinery. But government officials along with fuel suppliers, traders and networks must fulfill this task no matter how difficult it may be. I'm sure they will. We must take from the European Union as much fuel as our citizens need now. Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Ukraine Melinda Simmons returned to Kyiv today. Currently, 27 foreign diplomatic missions operate in the capital of our country. And this is an extremely important gesture of support for Ukraine, for which we are grateful to all of them. Such gestures, together with strong defensive, financial and political support from the free world, mean that the need to end the war is becoming more and more obvious to Russia. The defeat of the occupiers is unalterable. In the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region, collaborators say that they are allegedly preparing for the transition to the \"ruble zone\". Any attempt to transfer our territory to Russia's administrative, monetary, or any other system will mean only one thing: Russia itself will suffer from that. Our responses, sanctions and other reactions of the free world to Russia's aggressive actions will not be delayed. The dismantlement of debris in Kyiv, where Russian missiles hit yesterday during the visit of UN Secretary-General António Guterres, continues. Unfortunately, such a deliberate and brutal humiliation of the United Nations by Russia was left without a powerful response. Today it became known that a journalist, an employee of Radio Liberty Vera Hyrych was killed by a Russian missile hitting a residential building in Kyiv. She became the 23rd media representative whose life was cut short as a result of the Russian invasion since February 24. My condolences to all relatives and friends. Eternal memory to all the victims of this war! Today in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine in the Mariyinsky Palace, I presented awards to our defenders and members of the families of fallen warriors. The Order of the Golden Star was awarded to the Heroes of Ukraine: Lieutenant Colonel Serhiy Burkovsky, Captain Vitaliy Hural, Senior Lieutenant Dmytro Dozirchy, Lieutenant Colonel Oleksandr Zuhravy, Colonel Dmytro Kashchenko, Major Oleksandr Kukurba, Captain Oleh Pasichnyk, Lieutenant Colonel Vyacheslav Tsyhankov, Colonel of the Medical Service Oleksandr Sliesarenko, Lieutenant Colonel Leonid Khoda, Colonel Denys Chayuk and Lieutenant General Serhiy Nayev. Also, three servicemen were posthumously awarded the Order of the Golden Star. I had the honor to hand them over to the relatives of our heroes - Sergeant Volodymyr Balyuk, Master Sergeant Oleksandr Tsyupak, Major Pavlo Sbytov. It is thanks to our heroes, thanks to all those who stood up for our state, that we can live, can be with our families in our homes. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Unbreakable people of the bravest country! Today we marked the Border Guard Day. It is clear that there can be no celebrations during the war. But it is necessary to support Ukrainian men and women who defend the state in the ranks of the Border Guard Service. Since the first days of the war - and not only since February 24, but also since 2014 - border guards have been bravely defending Ukraine. They fulfill combat missions. They were the first to face the Russian invaders at the state border. They are under daily shelling. They are fighting side by side with the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with our National Guard, with the National Police, with the territorial defense and all those who stood up for our state. In particular, they are fighting in Mariupol, heroically defending our city. 340 border guards - our heroes. I talked to them today. Congratulated them. Thanked them. I am grateful to everyone whose professional day was today. I had the honor to present state awards to border guards who distinguished themselves in the battles for our state. The occupiers are accumulating additional forces for new attacks against our military in the east of the country. They built up reinforcements in the Kharkiv region, trying to increase pressure in Donbas. They have already lost more than 23,000 soldiers in the battles of this senseless war for Russia. But they do not stop. We know that the Russian command is preparing for new big losses. In those units, the personnel of which was almost completely destroyed or significantly weakened in March-April, new people are being recruited. With little motivation. With little combat experience. They just want to get the right amount. So that they can throw these units into the offensive. The Russian command is well aware that thousands more Russian soldiers will be killed and thousands more will be wounded in the coming weeks. But why do the Russian soldiers themselves need this? Why do their families need this? Russian commanders lie to their soldiers saying they will face some serious responsibility for refusing to fight. And at the same time they do not tell, for example, about the preparation by the Russian army of additional refrigerators for storing corpses. They do not tell what new \"planned\" losses the generals expect. Every Russian soldier can still save his life. You'd better survive in Russia than die on our land. Our defenders have already destroyed more than a thousand Russian tanks. Almost two hundred Russian aircraft. Almost two and a half thousand armored fighting vehicles. Of course, the occupiers still have equipment in stock. Yes, they still have missiles to strike at our territory. But this war has already weakened Russia so much that they have to plan even fewer military equipment for the parade in Moscow. We are actively communicating with partners to enhance sanctions on Russia. For Mariupol, for all the destroyed cities and communities of Ukraine, for war crimes against our people. For missile and air strikes at the territory of Ukraine. Today the occupiers again fired missiles at the Dnipropetrovsk region and Odesa. Again and again, Russian troops prove that the people of Odesa are the same enemies for Russia as all other Ukrainians. The runway of the Odesa airport was destroyed. We will, of course, rebuild it. But Odesa will never forget such a Russian attitude towards it. We expect a decision on oil restrictions against Russia in the near future. We insist that a fair part of sanctions against Russian oil should be the blocking of any attempts by Russia to circumvent restrictions through the sale of so-called oil blends. If any company or state helps Russia trade oil, it must also face sanctions. Any sponsorship in the interests of the Russian military terrorist machine must end. I spoke today with President of France Emmanuel Macron. On various areas of cooperation between Ukraine and France, especially on defense. Also - on cooperation on Ukraine's path to the European Union. We are moving towards the political formalization of what is already a fact: Ukraine has become an integral part of a united Europe. I also spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On defense support for Ukraine and other efforts necessary to end the war. I informed Boris about the current situation on the battlefield in the areas of active clashes and in detail about the situation in our east, in Mariupol, in the south of the country. All the leaders of the free world know what Russia has done to Mariupol. And Russia will not go unpunished for this. Many of the leaders are trying to help save our heroic defenders of the city. This was discussed in great detail with the UN Secretary-General during his visit to Kyiv. We are doing everything to ensure that the evacuation mission from Mariupol is carried out. I held talks with President of Switzerland Cassis. Thanked for the humanitarian support of Ukraine and Ukrainians. The mediating role of Switzerland in helping Ukrainians who found themselves in Russia was discussed. Preparations for the conference on postwar reconstruction of our state were also discussed. We are doing everything to return normal life to the de-occupied part of our Ukraine. The work of humanitarian offices has already begun in 93% of de-occupied settlements. We are actively demining the liberated territory. Every day several dozen settlements are added to the list of those where demining has been completed. 69% of de-occupied settlements are again with full-fledged local self-government. We are restoring electricity supply, communications, water supply and gas supply. We are doing everything to return normal medicine, educational services, access to financial institutions. We are restoring roads. Of course, there is still a lot of work ahead. The occupiers are still on our land and still do not recognize the apparent failure of their so-called operation. We still need to fight and direct all efforts to drive the occupiers out. And we will do it. Ukraine will be free. Kherson, Nova Kakhovka, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Dniprorudne and all other temporarily occupied cities and communities in which the occupiers are now pretending to be \"masters\" will be liberated. The Ukrainian flag will return wherever it should be by right. Return with a normal life, which Russia is simply unable to provide even on its own territory. I signed a decree on awarding our defenders - warriors of the National Guard of Ukraine. 133 national guards were awarded state awards, 11 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for the state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today we finally managed to start the evacuation of people from Azovstal. After many weeks of negotiations, after many attempts, different meetings, people, calls, countries, proposals. Finally! There was not a single day when we did not try to find a solution that would save our people. Today, for the first time in all the days of the war, this vital corridor has started working. For the first time there were two days of real ceasefire on this territory. More than a hundred civilians have already been evacuated - women and children first of all. Who were fleeing hostilities there. At Azovstal.  Given all the complexities of the process, the first evacuees will arrive in Zaporizhzhia tomorrow morning. Hopefully this doesn’t fail. Our team will meet them there. I hope that tomorrow all the necessary conditions will be met to continue the evacuation of people from Mariupol. We plan to start at 8 am. I am also grateful to all those who participated in the preparation of the rescue of people and who ensure this humanitarian corridor. I am grateful to everyone who held negotiations. To Iryna Vereshchuk as the coordinator of this process. I am grateful to our intelligence. Our team - David, Andriy. And also to the partners who joined and managed to help. In particular, from the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross. We will continue to do everything to evacuate our people from Azovstal, from Mariupol in general. The organization of such humanitarian corridors is one of the elements of the ongoing negotiation process. It is very complex. But no matter how difficult it was, more than 350,000 people were rescued from the areas of hostilities. I discussed key issues of assistance to our state with Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi who visited Kyiv together with a US Congress delegation. We are grateful to all partners who convey such important and powerful signals of support for Ukraine to the world and to Russia by visiting our capital in these conditions and at such a difficult time. Mrs. Pelosi and I had four hours of very substantive negotiations, as they say, multifaceted. In particular, on defense supplies, macro-financial assistance, sanctions policy, political cooperation with the United States. I thanked for the revival of the historic Lend-Lease program, which once helped protect freedom in Europe and can certainly do so a second time. We discussed specific areas - how Lend-Lease can work to strengthen our state as much as possible and help in the struggle for freedom. I also thanked for the preparation of a large package of aid to Ukraine worth 33 billion US dollars. We discussed how we can strengthen sanctions on Russia in a way that most effectively encourages it to end the war and limits Russia's ability to circumvent existing and future sanctions. I felt the support of our initiatives. I awarded Mrs. Pelosi with the Order of Princess Olga for her significant personal contribution to strengthening our cooperation and sincere participation in the defense of freedom. Today, Russian troops continued to strike at the territory of our state. The targets they choose prove once again that the war against Ukraine is a war of extermination for the Russian army. They targeted the warehouses of agricultural enterprises. The grain warehouse was destroyed. The warehouse with fertilizers was also shelled. They continued shelling of residential neighborhoods in the Kharkiv region, Donbas, etc. They are accumulating forces in the south of the country to try to attack our cities and communities in the Dnipropetrovsk region. What could be Russia's strategic success in this war? Honestly, I do not know. The ruined lives of people and the burned or stolen property will give nothing to Russia. It will only increase the toxicity of the Russian state and the number of those in the world who will work to isolate Russia. The Armed Forces of Ukraine respond to all the attacks of the invaders. And they will continue to respond until the occupiers leave our land. I am grateful to all our defenders. To everyone who has been defending the state since February 24 and since 2014. In just 67 days of the full-scale war, 143 our warriors have already been awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. More than 10,600 defenders have been awarded state awards of Ukraine. Eternal glory to all who stood up for the state! Eternal memory to all who gave life for Ukraine! Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 68th day of our strong defense is coming to an end. The 68th day of self-destruction of Russia. Self-destruction in every sense of the word. If this country once had what is called a reputation, now Russia does things on a daily basis that simply preclude any adequacy. Yesterday, for example, Russia's foreign minister openly and without hesitation said that the biggest anti-Semites were allegedly among the Jews themselves. And that Hitler allegedly had Jewish blood. How could this be said on the eve of the anniversary of the victory over Nazism? These words mean that Russia's top diplomat is blaming the Jewish people for Nazi crimes. No words. Of course, there is a big scandal in Israel today as regards these words. However, no one hears objections or excuses from Moscow. There is silence. Hence, they agree with what their foreign minister said. After the Russian missile attack at Babyn Yar in Kyiv, after the Menorah damaged by shelling at the site of the mass executions in Drobytsky Yar near Kharkiv, after the deaths of ordinary people who survived the Nazi occupation and Nazi concentration camps from Russian shelling, such an anti-Semitic thrust by their minister means Russia has forgotten all the lessons of World War II. Or maybe they never studied those lessons. So the question is will the Israeli ambassador stay in Moscow knowing their new position? Will relations with Russia remain as usual? Because it's not accidental. The words of the Russian foreign minister - a \"great connoisseur of Hitlerism\" - are not accidental. It is no coincidence that the Russian occupiers are creating so-called \"filtration camps\" on Ukrainian land through which thousands of our Ukrainian citizens are passing. Where our people are killed, tortured and raped. It is no coincidence that the occupiers capture civilians and take them hostage or deport them as free labor. It is no coincidence that they are waging a so-called total war to destroy all living things, after which only the burned ruins of entire cities and villages remain. To do this, one must completely reject the moral and achievements of the victors of Nazism. But if such people are in the Russian leadership, it does not mean they can judge others in Europe or in the world according to themselves. If they send tens of thousands of their citizens to die in a foreign land and do not even take the bodies of those killed from the streets, roads, fields, it does not mean that everyone else is like them. If there are people among them who come from Ukraine but support the extermination of Ukrainians and everything Ukrainian, it does not mean that everyone else has abandoned normal human morality. Today, Russian troops launched another missile strike at Odesa. Destroyed the dormitory. A 14-year-old boy was killed. A 17-year-old girl was wounded, she has a shrapnel wound. What is it? For what? What did these children and the dormitory threaten the Russian state with? And that's how they fight. That's all. A gymnasium founded over a hundred years ago burned down in Lysychansk, Luhansk region, due to Russian shelling. It was built by the Belgians for this city. It withstood two world wars. But, as we see, this gymnasium turned out to be a terrible threat to modern Russia. 220 Ukrainian children have been killed by the Russian army since February 24. And we still don't know about everyone, because we don't have access to the temporarily occupied areas of our state. 1570 educational institutions were destroyed or damaged by shelling. It's in a little over two months! That is why the whole free world united so that no one justifies Nazism, kills children or destroys peaceful cities as Russia does. Today in Kyiv I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark. We discussed the whole range of issues of our bilateral relations, especially defense, financial and political cooperation. I see progress in implementing the agreements reached during the talks with the Prime Minister of Denmark. I am grateful. I received good signals. Plans to rebuild Ukraine after the war were also discussed. And support for our movement towards the European Union. I am grateful that Denmark resumes the work of its embassy in our capital. This is already the 29th foreign mission that returned to Ukraine. We are working on new sanctions against Russia. We expect a new package from the European Union in the near future. This package should include clear steps to block Russia's energy revenues. We truly believe in this. So that the terrorist state is not given a billion euros a day for fuel. But it is also worth preparing for the next sanctions steps now. In any case, we will have to block all export-import operations with Russia. Because that's what they make money on in Moscow. And they do not even understand that international law and peace in Europe must be respected. We continue to do everything to save our people from Mariupol. The evacuation operation continues. Tomorrow we also expect movement through humanitarian corridors from Berdyansk, Tokmak, Vasylivka. The Armed Forces of Ukraine heroically repel the occupiers' attempts to advance. Kharkiv direction, Donbas, the south of the country - everywhere the situation remains extremely difficult. But I am grateful to each and every one of our defenders who are holding the defense. I have just signed a large decree to award our military. 438 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Senior Lieutenant Dmytro Ruslanovych Todorov for his personal courage and extraordinary efficiency in the battles against the occupiers in the Donetsk region. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Mr. Chairman! Dear people's deputies of Ukraine! Ladies and Gentlemen! First of all, I would like to thank the leader of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, and all the people of the United Kingdom. For the words we hear. For the actions we see. For the support we feel. For the help we actually receive. For the victory that we will definitely gain together! On October 8, 2020, our countries became strategic partners. And on February 24, 2022, we proved that our partnership is not on paper. Our partnership is on the battlefield. In the battles for common ideals, battles for a common future. It has been almost ten weeks since the Russian Federation declared full-scale war against them and invaded our beautiful Ukrainian land. During this time, Ukraine and Britain have gone a path from partners to friends and brothers. And the one who lied that he is a friend and a brother has gone a path from a neighbor to an occupier and a terrorist. Is it sad? Yes. Is it scary? No. Because these almost ten weeks have proved: it is not scary when such an evil enemy is against you if such a good friend is next to you. Such as Great Britain. And leader Boris Johnson. And these words are not flattery, not courtesy, they are reality. We are together. Almost every day. We are in touch. Daily. If we don't have a conversation today, it means only one thing: we are busy with what we agreed on yesterday. And it is so almost all these weeks, all this difficult time. For the sake of one goal, one moment - the first second of victory. And for the sake of one epoch - the epoch where peace reigns. In Ukraine, and therefore in Europe, and therefore in the world. I would like to thank the United Kingdom, which is bringing this moment closer with us and which is ready to guarantee our security. And this gratitude of mine is not a formality. Because I know that the guarantees of Great Britain will never be a formality for Ukraine. Because these almost ten weeks have proved that your word is solid and your actions are decisive. Without any \"almost\". I hate that word - \"almost\". As well as our interaction and support of British allies. First of all, it is a weapon and equipment for our military, which protects both Ukraine, Europe and the whole world from the Russian occupiers. I will not voice all the details to the public - let it be an unpleasant surprise for the aggressor every day. Instead, I can speak openly about all other forms of support. This is humanity. And help for our refugees and internally displaced persons. Medicines, food, ambulances and fire engines and other large humanitarian aid. This is justice. And assistance in the investigation of war crimes of the Russian Federation in Ukraine. This is resilience. Macro-financial assistance for our economy. This is the abolition of customs duties, the abolition of quotas for our bilateral trade. This is the reconstruction of our land, this is the reconstruction of Kyiv and the Kyiv region, which will be joined by Great Britain. These are important global things. Sanctions against the Russian Federation, energy embargo, asset blocking. These are ordinary, very simple human, but no less important, symbolic things. Blue and yellow flags on Trafalgar Square and Downing Street. When we are supported by London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast, supported by Liverpool, Manchester and hundreds of other cities in this great state. When Ukraine is supported by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Sir Paul McCartney, Elton John and Sting. Richard Branson, Joanne Rowling, the Beckhams, Benedict Cumberbatch, Queen, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple. Ed Sheeran, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, Daniel Radcliffe and, of course, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. It is also very important - the return of Melinda Simmons, and the recent visit of Prime Minister Johnson. At a very difficult time and at a very necessary moment. Our walk in the streets of Kyiv showed the world that the heart of Ukraine feels. Pain. But the people we met there, their words, their eyes, smiles and gifts - already famous roosters, the same as in Borodyanka - all this showed the world what our Ukrainian soul feels. Indomitability. Unbreakability. Therefore, hope for victory. Today, I, our parliament and the entire Ukrainian people can say one thing: thank you, Britain! Thank you, friends! Dear people's deputies of Ukraine! Please agree, when there is such unity in this hall, it is priceless! During these almost ten weeks, I have addressed the House of Commons, the US Congress, the European Parliament, the Bundestag, the Knesset, the Seimas, and many other parliamentarians and parliaments. But I did not address you. And this is not contempt, on the contrary - it is a great trust in you. You are here. And you know very well what is happening in our country. We are all citizens of this great state, and you know exactly what to do. I believe that has not changed in these almost ten weeks. I will be happy if the following becomes obvious and indisputable for you. You are the people's deputies of the greatest state in the modern world! I'm sure of it! You are the people's deputies of Ukraine. Keywords are \"people\" and \"Ukraine\". I think we will abandon trifles, political speculation until peacetime, although it is better to abandon them forever. The agenda of the Verkhovna Rada is obvious. The keyword is \"order\". Because there is no time for spam, quarrels and PR - everyone already knows you. I think wise rationalism and sound nationalism are important. All this is very important for us today. You are part of a large Ukrainian army. Your frontline is a legislative field in which you must work for our people, for each of us, for our state, for our victory. Like our army, like the whole country. Work 24\/7. No days off, no unnecessary emotions, slogans, etc. Today we all have one party, and this party is Ukraine. One faction - Ukraine. One majority - Ukraine. One, strong, independent. And everything that does not help it or, God forbid, harms, weakens or splits, must be not in the minority, no. This must be a thing of the past. Just like someone's hopes of sitting out somewhere. Currently, the absence of a deputy is justified by only two things: his work abroad or in the regions for the interests of our state or his death for the interests of the state. The rest is of no interest to Ukraine today. It doesn't need anything else, it won't have anything else! Anything else follows the Russian warship! Please do not waste time on unnecessary laws. There are important priorities for the state. I know that you are professionals, you will do it. The state is waiting. Please do not waste your time, my time, the time of the people of Ukraine on minor initiatives and unimportant things. It seems to me that laws should be as timely as Lend-Lease. Accurate as our \"Stugna\" and \"Bayraktar\". And bring benefits like \"Neptune\". And glory like our army. And to be such that will go down in history like the people of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mrs. Speaker of Parliament! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies! The people of Albania! Yesterday, Muslims around the world celebrated Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting for Islam. And I congratulate you on this holiday. I wish you what all Ukrainian men and women wish for each other - peace. During this month, the Muslims of Ukraine and our entire society have not seen a single calm and peaceful day. That's how we live after February 24. Exactly like that. Russia has turned all our days into a mortal danger. Yesterday, a 14-year-old boy died as a result of a missile attack on our Odesa, our southern city. A 17-year-old girl was also wounded. Every day we have such a reality. Every day Ukrainians lose children because of Russian strikes. And more than 600 children have fallen victim to this Russian invasion. 220 children were killed and 406 were injured. Today is a farewell ceremony for journalist Vira Gyrych who was killed by a Russian missile at her home in the capital of our state, Kyiv. The missile hit her house. An ordinary multi-storey building near the downtown of the capital. The Russian army is firing at our cities and villages with artillery and aircraft. Does not spare missiles. In our largest city in the east of the country, in the city of Kharkiv, a fifth of all houses was destroyed. This is more than two and a half thousand houses. They were burned, destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling. Once one of the most developed cities on the shore of the Sea of Azov - the city of Mariupol - is completely destroyed. There are no undamaged buildings. None, imagine! This half-million city has been under siege by the Russian army since early March. They didn’t allow water, food, medicine - nothing and no one. And they didn’t stop bombing it. This is literally a scorched city. But you can take any Ukrainian city or village where the occupiers came and there will be very similar messages. About destruction and about murders. About tortures. About forced deportation of people to Russia. About total looting of everything on our territory. Older people who survived two occupations - the Nazi occupation during World War II and now the occupation by the Russian army - say they did not see such atrocities 80 years ago. Now they saw the Russian military shooting children in the face. Now they saw ordinary people - peasants who had been taken prisoner - being forced to lie on the ground day and night in sub-zero temperatures. It turns out that the Russian troops have a special method of \"fighting\" the escape of prisoners in the cold season: they are forced to pour water into their shoes, put the shoes on and lie on the ground in the cold. People stopped feeling their feet, their toes froze. But the occupiers did not even allow them to stand up, let alone to warm up. In the areas liberated from the Russian army, we constantly find graves of tortured people. They have their hands tied, traces of shots on their arms and legs, and broken ribs. Many were shot in the back of the head. Often the occupiers did not even allow the bodies of those killed to be buried. Bodies are found in forests, fields, basements, wells. Retreating from our land, the Russian army left the dead just on the streets as well. Russia was offered to cease fire at least on Orthodox Easter. There was no answer. It was also offered on Pesach - there was no answer. Russia has also ignored the sanctity of the month of Ramadan. Just think about it: 86 religious sites were destroyed or damaged by shelling. These are churches, mosques, houses of worship. The Russian army is not trying to protect even the facilities of the Russian church from its shelling! This is a complete abandonment of morality. Complete rejection of universal values. Complete non-recognition of life as an unconditional value. And they do not want to stop in Ukraine. They want to go further. In an attempt to revive the worst-level tyranny seen in the twentieth century, Russia has become the greatest threat to the entire free world. And I am grateful to every nation that is fighting this tyranny with us. Because only if we stop Russia now in Ukraine will we be able to save Europe from the coming of a new era - the era of non-freedom. Save it from what your people had to go through, in particular. Ladies and Gentlemen! The people of Albania! I am grateful to you for not hesitating who to support in this struggle. You are definitely on the side of freedom and truth. Thank you for concrete steps for Ukraine. For defense assistance. For supporting sanctions on Russia. For taking care of our people and hosting our children, especially in Durrës. This attitude of yours towards Ukrainian men and women in difficult times reminds me of St. Mother Teresa. An Albanian woman whose life has become a symbol of humanism for everyone in the world. She taught people that good daily efforts can defeat evil and bring them closer to the holiness that people will remember from generation to generation. I believe that by working together with all Europeans in this way - by our daily good efforts, we will be able not only to stop this war waged by Russia, but also to protect Europe in the future from the recurrence of such a threat. As the sixth package of sanctions against Russia's aggression is being discussed in the European Union, we must all insist that it includes an oil embargo and a real blockade of any schemes that Russia uses to deceive the free world and ignore sanctions. Russian banks must be completely disconnected from the global financial system. However difficult it may be, it is necessary to deliberately restrict trade with the Russian Federation. Because if not today, then tomorrow Russia will consciously use trade ties to hit your market when it wants some political concessions from you. You need to deprive it of this tool in time. I ask you to close the ports for Russian ships. And limit the arrival of Russian tourists. Because you can never know who came to you... Maybe the killers who were in Bucha? Or maybe the tormentors of Mariupol? Or maybe someone who is already working to undermine your country? I am grateful to Albania for its cooperation within the United Nations platform. Especially now when your country is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. We need to do a principled thing and stop using UN funds to sponsor Russia. If it violates the UN Charter, threatens the world's food security and destroys peace in Europe, it has no right to receive a single cent from the UN. Since 2014, when Russia seized our Crimean peninsula and started the war in Donbas, the UN has purchased goods and services from it for at least two and a half billion dollars. This is simply unfair. Wrong. Decades ago, Ukraine and Albania chose the path of democracy and European integration. We did not deviate from this path. Together we are committed to the development of freedom and a united Europe. And I believe that when the time comes to decide on Ukraine's accession to the European Union, your vote will be able to sound in our support. I am sure that right now everyone in the world is showing their true character. Someone is big in size, but very small when you have to be bold. And someone is small on the map, but its cordiality is one of the greatest. Thank you, Albania! Thank you for your support. Thank you for your cordiality. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I wish you health, Ukrainians! Our defenders! We finally have the result, the first result of our evacuation operation from Azovstal in Mariupol, which we have been organizing for a very long time. It took a lot of effort, long negotiations and various mediations. Today 156 people arrived in Zaporizhzhia. Women and children. They have been in shelters for more than two months. Just imagine! For example, a child is six months old, two of which are underground, fleeing bombs and shelling. Finally, these people are completely safe. They will get help. And I am grateful to all those on whom the rescue of these people depended. Who agreed and who helped. I am grateful to everyone who ensured the physical transportation of people through the humanitarian corridor. Of course, we will continue to do everything to get all our people out of Mariupol and Azovstal. It's difficult. But we need everyone who stays there: civilians and military. There was not a day when we did not address this issue, when our people did not try to solve this issue. Yes, we managed to achieve a ceasefire for almost three days in order to make the humanitarian corridor work. Currently, Russian troops are not adhering to the agreements. They continue massive strikes at Azovstal. They are trying to storm the complex. But I have been told many times that no one can be saved. That it is impossible. And today 156 people are in Zaporizhzhia. This is not a victory yet, but this is already a result. And I believe that there is a chance to save our other people. Apparently, the Russian military has reacted extremely nervously to our success today. Various Ukrainian cities have once again become targets for Russian missiles and Russian strikes. Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv region, Dnipropetrovsk region, Odesa, Kharkiv region - such a scale of today's shelling clearly does not indicate that Russia has any special military purpose. Strike at Zakarpattia? What exactly can it give Russia? They are trying to vent their powerlessness. Because they can't beat Ukraine. But they can - so far - burn children's attractions in Gorky Park in Kharkiv or destroy a bridge. Or a grain warehouse or a house with people. The more such strikes, the farther Russia is from civilization. From what is called civilizedness. Today we also have another tragic news. A terrible road accident took place in the Rivne region. A bus, a car and a fuel truck collided. As of this time, 17 people died. But there may be more casualties. My sincere condolences to all those who lost their loved ones. I commissioned to provide all the necessary assistance to the victims. I am grateful to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the great friend of Ukraine, Boris Johnson, for his support of Ukraine and our defenders. Today Boris addressed our parliament and our people. These were very important words, warm, friendly, powerful. This is a very sincere gesture. I am also grateful to Britain for the new package of support for our country, which the Prime Minister announced today. I also addressed the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine today. For the first time during a full-scale war. I emphasized the main thing - and the main thing not only for me, but also for the whole of Ukraine. I am sure we must maintain maximum unity. Because our success depends on unity. Not only political success, but also the defense of the state, the strength of our people, our society. I continued the very useful practice of addressing the parliaments of our partner countries. Today (addressed - ed.) the Parliament and the people of Albania. Thanked for the support, including defensive support. Noted the cordiality with which the people of Albania support our people. Other such addresses are also planned. I also spoke with representatives of the largest global companies - in the CEO Wall Street Journal club (this is a very influential club. Three trillion dollars is the total turnover of companies whose leaders are in this club). About how to put pressure on Russia to end the war. About how to rebuild Ukraine after the war together. About what the post-war model of the Ukrainian economy can be. I believe that such economic diplomacy is one of our most important tasks. I spoke today with Polish President Andrzej Duda. I congratulated him and the entire Polish people on the national holiday - the Constitution Day of Poland. We discussed further cooperation, concrete steps and support for our defense. I informed him about the current situation in the areas of hostilities. About what is happening in Mariupol. About the evacuation of Ukrainians. And about what else we can do together to help protect our state and our common freedom - freedom of Ukrainians and Poles, all Europeans. Traditionally, before delivering the address, I signed decrees awarding our heroes. 185 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, two of them posthumously. Two more of our defenders were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for our state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear friends! Danish people! Today you celebrate the anniversary of the day that was a dream. It has long been a dream of freedom and peace. This dream has become a reality. Five years. It was on this day that the five long years of Nazi occupation of your country came to an end. They lost. And freedom won. Life won. Denmark and the whole world then celebrated and hoped that such a brutal war would be the last and that no one would want to destroy peace anymore. They hoped that there would be no more feeling of mortal danger. That people can get rid of military habits. They hoped to forget forever about the light masking that was required. They hoped that air-raid sirens would no longer sound to report the real threat. That they can be turned on only once a year to remember the war that took place. But the war came again. It is here and now. It is in Ukraine. And it is not going to stop on our land. And it has already become as brutal as that war, the victory in which we all remember every year in May. I remember addressing you and the Folketing on the 34th day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. I said then that Russia used 1370 missiles against our country. Today - already 1993 missiles. Just imagine how many lives they took. Most of them hit non-military targets. Then, on March 29, I told you that the Russian occupiers had destroyed 773 educational facilities in our country. And today - twice as much. 1584. These are kindergartens, schools, universities. This is what the Russian army is fighting against in Ukraine. The invaders have already killed 220 Ukrainian children. And we do not yet know for sure the situation in the occupied territories. But when I spoke to you last time, there were 144 names on the list of children killed. You see these terrible numbers grow. There were 144. Now - 220 children killed! They did not even have time to feel what life is like. The Russian state is not yet ready to stop the war. They still dream of capturing Ukraine and other European countries. They still dream that freedom in Europe must disappear. But their dreams must not come true. The dream of peace must come true. Our and your dream. Just like it was 77 years ago. Right now in Ukraine it is being decided how people will live on our continent. Whether there will be peace. Not only for us, but also for our neighbors, for you and us. Evil does not know what state borders are. Tyranny never stops at capturing just one country. You are already helping us fight. We are grateful to you. Fight with weapons, with your \"yes\" vote for our accession to the European Union, with honesty in the issue of sanctions and with sincerity towards our people. The sea of Ukrainian flags here today, the sea of flags on the streets of your cities shows that you understand everything. No one will now say how many more days this war, unleashed by the Russian Federation, will last. But I believe that our Liberation Day is approaching. I believe that just as I am addressing your people now, when you celebrate the anniversary of the liberation of your country, your representatives will address the Ukrainian people as we celebrate the anniversary of our peace. Now, as every year, you light candles across the country in memory of that war and victory over evil. And I ask you, when you see the warm light of candles, remember, please, about Ukrainian children. About those 220 children whose lives were taken by this war. Remember that Europe can do its best to keep this horrible list of children killed from growing. Never again. I am grateful to each and every one of you! Thank you, Denmark! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today I will start with a story about one person. About Oleksandr Makhov - a well-known journalist. I'm sure you've seen his reports on Ukraine and Dom TV channels. You may have seen his comments, his posts. He has always been like that - with his own position. Patriotic and sincere. And always without vanity. And he was always among the bravest, among the first. He always worked in the hottest spots. Tried to bring true material. Powerful material. In 2017, he was the first Ukrainian journalist to visit our station in Antarctica. When COVID came, he was not afraid. He has lived in Sanzhary for two weeks, where Ukrainians were brought to from China. From the first day of the full-scale war, he was on the frontline. Volunteer. ATO veteran. Warrior of the 95th assault brigade. Born in the Luhansk region. He had a special feeling of what this war means. Today he died in the Kharkiv region, in the battles near Izium. He was 36 years old. My sincere condolences to relatives and friends. Let his son Vladyslav know: Russia will bear responsibility for this death. We will definitely gain victory for Ukraine. I'm sure it was Oleksandr's dream. And we will make it come true. Eternal memory to him and to all our heroes who gave lives for Ukraine! The second stage of our evacuation operation from Mariupol was completed today. 344 people were rescued - from the city and its suburbs. That's how many people departed to Zaporizhzhia today. Our team is getting ready to meet them. Meet in the same way as more than 150 people whom we managed to take out of Azovstal. They all receive the necessary help. All of them will receive the most caring treatment from our state. I am grateful to all those who make the evacuation operation successful: Iryna Vereshchuk, Andriy Yermak, David Arakhamia, UN representatives, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and everyone who reached an agreement and provided silence and corridors for the people. We are negotiating and hope to continue rescuing people from Azovstal, from Mariupol. There are still civilians. Women, children. To save them, we need to continue the silence. The Ukrainian side is ready to provide it. It takes time to just lift people out of those basements, out of those underground shelters. In the current conditions, we cannot use special equipment to clear the debris. Everything is done manually. But we believe that everything will work out. I spoke today with UN Secretary-General António Guterres. About what has already happened. What we still have to do to save Mariupol residents and defenders of the city. There was not a day when I didn't do it, when we didn't do it. And I am grateful to everyone who helps. I spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Bennett. I congratulated him on the Independence Day of the State of Israel. We talked about the situation in the east of our country and especially in Mariupol. We also discussed the scandalous and completely unacceptable statements of the Russian Foreign Minister, which outraged the whole world. I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. We agreed on the next diplomatic steps needed for peace. We discussed how to bring to justice all war criminals. Every Russian soldier and every commander who killed, tortured and tormented our people. Today, the Russian invaders launched another missile strike at our cities. At Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia. At the cities of Donbas and other regions of our country. All these crimes will get proper answers. Both legal and quite practical - on the battlefield. I addressed the people of Denmark today on the occasion of Liberation Day. The Nazis were expelled from this country 77 years ago. Every year in May, all Europeans, all decent people on earth recall this feat - victory over the worst evil in human history. Victory in the war against Nazism. But to recall means not just to remember. This means remembering and really trying to never allow what the Nazis did to Europe again. It is the Ukrainians, together with our friends and partners - the anti-war coalition, as the anti-Hitler once was - that are repelling those who have forgotten exactly why people rejoiced in 1945. Because if everyone in Russia really remembered, this war simply would not have started now. Traditionally, before delivering the evening address, I signed a decree awarding our defenders. 35 servicemen of the 19th missile brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. I am grateful to all our heroes! To all who stood up for our state. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! After ten weeks of the full-scale war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, our meeting in this format and for this purpose proves that Ukraine, Europe and the whole free world are on the way to a common victory.Our state retains full functionality. Our continent is united. Millions and millions of people around the world support us to make tyranny lose. The Armed Forces of Ukraine and all our heroic defenders bravely and firmly defend freedom on the battlefield. But how this brutal war will end is decided not only on the battlefield. But also in the aspects of economy, finance, humanitarian support, the ability to ensure a normal life in the territory free from the enemy, in rebuilding what was destroyed by the Russian army. Freedom must demonstrate that it protects and provides for people better than tyranny, which has enjoyed a massive flow of money for oil, gas and other raw materials for decades. That's how freedom will win. That is why this conference is important for everyone in Europe. Both strategically and tactically important. First. Sufficient financial resources are needed so that Ukrainian men and women are provided with everything they need while the war continues. The Ukrainian state, as the administrator of these funds, will ensure all urgent needs - both defensive and social and humanitarian. Second. We are already preparing a large-scale Recovery Plan for Ukraine after the war and need a strategic international support plan for Ukraine that will be a modern analogue of the historic Marshall Plan. It is money, technology, expertise and growth opportunities that are needed to return to a secure life, to modernization and to social development. It will be an investment in the stability of the whole of central and eastern Europe. So that the aggressor knows that it will not break the power of Europe and all free nations. And so that everything destroyed by the war is rebuilt at a high level. The reconstruction of Ukraine must now become the same historical example for our time and for the future as the restoration of European countries after World War II. And such free world’s investments, if they are fast, if they are sufficient, will mean that millions of our people who became IDPs because of this war will be able to return home. We offer our partners - civilized and responsible states - to take patronage over those regions, over those cities, over those industries of Ukraine that have suffered from the war waged by Russia. Take patronage to work with us to rebuild these regions, our cities, towns and industries. Such a patronage project can create a new and equally historic example of interaction and partnership between the free world, between the regions, cities and companies of Europe and democratic countries. Third. Ukraine’s quick movement to the European Union is needed through its candidate status, which must be granted right now - in conditions of war. As part of a special shortened procedure for EU membership. Because this war of Russia against Ukraine was planned as a prelude to a strike at a united Europe. Greater unification is a powerful answer. That is why Ukraine's membership in the European Union must be an absolute reality. Not just promises, not just prospects, but practical steps. I know we are ready for these steps. And you know it, too. And I am sure that most of you, European leaders, are also ready for this. Ladies and Gentlemen! I am very grateful to Poland and Sweden, to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson for organizing this important high-level donor conference. I am very grateful to President of the European Council Charles Michel and to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for their leadership, which makes Europe a true defender of the most important thing - freedom. I am grateful to all the participants of the Conference for being with us in this war for a free and democratic life for millions of people. Not only for Ukraine. But for all of us who may be threatened by tyranny. I believe that Europe will show its strength today. You will show your strength. In particular, international institutions - UN institutions, whose representatives are here with us now and can be even more effective. Because this is for our common freedom. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Unbreakable people of the bravest country! Usually I address Ukrainians at this time and in the same way every night, when I summarize the events of the passing day. Every night - from the first day of this full-scale war of Russia against our state of Ukraine. Every night I report to the public on what has been done to protect the state. On what the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to achieve. On how we help our people. And on what international negotiations took place. For example, today one of the notable news was the news of my conversation with you, Boris. Every time such negotiations take place, it is important for my country, for Ukraine. And no less important, I'm sure, for Britain. Because it is about steadfastness, courage and about the leadership that we demonstrate together - the Ukrainian and British nations. In defense of freedom. Our common freedom. Russian troops today, as every day during this war, have continued to bomb our cities and our people. For example, my traditional morning meeting with the military, with the leadership of the army, with government officials and diplomats was accompanied by the sound of an air-raid siren. This is our reality. Missile strikes every day. The day before yesterday - on the day when you, Boris, addressed our parliament, the Russian army launched 15 missile strikes at Ukraine. And this can be called a certain \"Russian compliment\" to your brilliant speech and our fruitful interstate cooperation. Because yesterday there were only 7 such strikes. Obviously, Russia is annoyed by our proximity - Ukraine and Britain. So this means that we are really strong in defending freedom in Europe. In general, during this war, the Russian army has used 2014 missiles against Ukraine already. 2682 appearances of Russian fighter jets in our skies have been recorded. Each of these \"arrivals\" is the death of our people, the destruction of our infrastructure. If we take only the medical infrastructure, to date, Russian troops have destroyed or damaged almost 400 health facilities. These are hospitals, maternity hospitals, outpatient clinics. In the temporarily occupied areas of Ukraine - in the east and south - the situation with access to medical services and medicines is just catastrophic. Even the simplest medications are missing. Russia has brought to Ukraine and Europe such problems that we could not have imagined a few months ago. This is in fact a complete lack of treatment for cancer patients. This is an extremely difficult or impossible access to insulin for diabetics. It's the inability to perform surgery... It's just a lack of antibiotics! These are the consequences of the Russian occupation for a part of our land, for a part of our people, which we must liberate from the invaders. And we will definitely do it. In particular, due to your support. Today the rescue operation from Mariupol was continued. With the assistance of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. People are on their way to safe territory. More than 150 people from Azovstal and more than 300 people from Mariupol and its suburbs who were evacuated by the humanitarian corridor this week are already receiving all the help they need. Medical, document renewal, financial assistance, communication with relatives, friends and families. Currently, Russian shelling and assault of Azovstal do not stop. But civilians still need to be taken out - women, children. Many children who are still there. Just imagine this hell! And there are children! More than two months of constant shelling, bombing, constant death nearby... We expect an effective regime of silence. We are doing everything to find a solution to save our military. Heroes who defend Mariupol against the occupiers prevailing in the number of troops. There are different units there. They have many wounded. But they do not give up. They are holding positions. We do not give up either. Every day, the whole team is looking for an option that will ensure the safety of these people. And I am grateful to everyone who helps. To all those who offered mediation and are making efforts to save Ukrainians. Today I addressed the participants of the high-level donors' conference held in Warsaw. It is also an element of our protection, an element of protection for the whole of Europe. Because it is not only on the battlefield that the fate of our state and the future of the continent is being decided now. But also in the economic field, in the field of readiness of world leaders to unite to rebuild Ukraine after this war and give stability and security to the center and east of Europe. We have the result. It has been announced that $ 6.5 billion has been raised at this conference. And this is good. But this is only part of what is really needed to restore normal life throughout the territory where Russia has brought the war. That is why we need a modern analogue of the Marshall Plan for Ukraine. Stronger participation of the free world and international institutions is needed. I spoke about this today at the conference. However, we call for the cooperation and support of each and everyone. Everyone for whom freedom matters. That is why United24 was launched today - a global initiative that will unite people from all over the world around the desire to help Ukraine. And I invite you to join this initiative! The initial component is a platform of the same name to raise funds to support our struggle. United24. Its main goal is to increase donations to Ukraine. Just a few clicks - and everyone can join the direction that they find most useful right now and for themselves. Because Ukraine needs up to $ 7 billion a month to cover the state budget deficit. In total, it has been calculated that already more than $ 600 billion is needed to rebuild what the Russian army destroyed. Just imagine this scale! That is why every manifestation of support, every sincere help to Ukraine is important. In particular, yours today. Ladies and Gentlemen! Friends! If everyone in the world - or at least the vast majority - were steadfast and courageous leaders as Ukraine, as Britain, I am sure we would have already ended this war and restored peace throughout our liberated territory for all our people. But we still have to fight. Fight. As you, Boris, said, addressing our Verkhovna Rada the day before yesterday, we are still writing one of the most victorious chapters in our history. And now we can assess the significance of this chapter, in particular, by the following fact: 11,672 of our defenders have already been awarded state awards for courage and effective defense of Ukraine. In a little over ten weeks. 11,672 people. And a few minutes before this address, I signed a decree awarding another 286 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is on the shoulders of these brave warriors and their brothers-in-arms that Ukraine and, to be honest, the whole of Europe are now standing. And I thank you for your really effective support of this struggle. Bravery is rightly believed the first of human qualities as it guarantees all others. Thank you, Britain! Thank you, Boris!  Thank you all! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I would like to greet everyone and you, dear Mr. Robin! Dear guests, dear friends! I am grateful for this opportunity to participate in this discussion. I am also grateful that Chatham House, one of the most influential think tanks in Europe, set up a special program back in 2015 for independent and in-depth research into the Ukrainian context. This research helps find answers to the most pressing questions. And these are the questions I would like to ask today. I know you will ask me questions, there will be a dialogue. But I am sure that each and every one of you is well aware of the level of the problems that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought. This is the highest priority for us and, I am sure, for the whole world today. It has brought problems not only to our people, but to everyone on the continent and to everyone in the world. I am absolutely sure of that. This is a full-scale invasion - one that Europe has seen only in the worst times of the 20th century. I would like to briefly outline some of the challenges. The first is the extreme brutality of the Russian army and its people who came here, and the Russian state's extreme contempt for all international conventions, the entire system of international law, human rights - for me, this is the most important thing, the inviolability of borders, the integrity of states in Europe. Why is Russia doing all this? Because they think that if they can be held responsible for such crimes, criminal actions, it will be decades later. They simply do not believe that the international community can hold those responsible for the war crimes to justice as they are hiding behind the nuclear force. The second challenge is, in fact, nuclear blackmail. For the first time in many decades. Absolutely outright. Russian state propagandists on their media resources calculate how long it takes for nuclear missiles to hit European capitals. They talk about it publicly, openly. They tell how to detonate nuclear explosives in the ocean to wash away everything in the British Isles with a radioactive wave. They prepare infographics, that is, they are serious about it. They boast that Russia can destroy any state leaving only \"nuclear ashes\". Moreover, \"nuclear ashes\" is their quote, which they repeat as a mantra. Why is this happening? This is a feeling of impunity, and we are sure of it. They are accustomed to the fact that business \"as usual\" has always returned to the relations of all states with Russia. And even now there are politicians in Europe who are not ashamed of ties with the Russian state after all that the Russian army has done in Ukraine. The third challenge is that the world is a few steps away from political chaos in dozens of countries, which could be the result of food and inflation crises. By blackmailing Europe into launching the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline last year, Russia has provoked a price crisis in Europe. Gazprom deliberately did not supply the market with the necessary amount of gas to cover the deficit, and as a result, gas prices in Europe reached a historic maximum. This has affected all Europeans without exception. Now, as part of a full-scale war against Ukraine, Russia is blocking our ports it has seized. What does this lead to? The global market is left without sufficient supplies of some key products from Ukraine. This is what we have, what is the priority for the world - grain, sunflower oil, corn, other agricultural products. What consequences do we see? I'm sure we don't see everything. Because there is not much analytics here. I think we will see all this in the future. In some countries there is a shortage of sunflower oil. In other countries, the chains of agricultural production connected with our supplies are slowing down. In other countries, a shortage of basic food products is expected. All this together puts pressure on prices. In North Africa, the Middle East, Asia. And then it will affect other regions of the world. And the poorest will suffer. Who always suffers? The poorest. We are sure that the middle class will also suffer. Obviously, the political consequences of this can be dangerous. That is why I say that food security is one of the components of political chaos. Dear attendees! Russia's war against our state, which at first seemed only a bilateral event to many, some even smiled, some said it was just a conflict, Russia says it is a military operation. Now we all evaluate it differently, more seriously. But today is already the 72nd day of a full-scale war, and we do not yet see its end. We do not see or feel the willingness of the Russian side. Just as we do not see comprehensive answers to all the threats posed by Russia. What do we offer? There has not been a day since February 24 when I and our entire team did not negotiate to obtain the necessary weapons. To agree on the necessary sanctions against Russia. To organize the necessary cooperation to document and investigate war crimes. There has not been a day since the beginning of the brutal blockade of Mariupol by the Russian army, this is one of the examples, when we did not try to find a diplomatic solution to rescue people and organize humanitarian corridors for this rescue. We are in contact with everyone who can provide financial support to Ukraine. We have already started preparing a large-scale Recovery Plan for Ukraine, as we have no doubt that we will be able to defend our independence. And we believe in this strength of the world, in our strength. This is not a belief in a miracle. Common sense tells us that the world's response to the aggressor's actions, which Russia is now allowing itself, must be immediate. And what’s the reality? We've been talking about the same things for months. For example, the oil embargo against Russia, the blocking of the entire banking sector of the terrorist state. For months we have been fighting for a sufficient supply of weapons. And I am grateful to those states that help us from the first days constantly, every day. Because they correctly assessed the threat. But, unfortunately, not all states have assessed it that way. Even now, not everyone evaluates it that way. Most of Russia-provoked challenges and threats have not been fully addressed. That's the main thing. So, we need new tools, we need to look for them constantly. New determination. Something that can stop not only Russia, but also any potential aggressor. Ukraine proposes to create just such a tool. We call it U24. United 24. By upgrading the global security system, we must create opportunities to prevent any aggression or at least stop it in 24 hours. Or - in 24 hours to provide such assistance to the victim of aggression, which will restore peace. Or - if it is not a war, but a natural disaster or any social challenge - in 24 hours the world community must provide a country or region with all the necessary assistance to save people. With such a global response system, we will be able to ensure that millions of people are never again threatened with physical destruction. Or threats of deportation. Or - famine, destruction. Therefore, here are the specific questions that need to be answered by politicians, experts and society. And the questions I want to ask you now. What exactly can be done to ensure that the responsibility for war crimes is inevitable and comes not after a decade but faster, as in ordinary criminal proceedings? What specific sanctions against Russia can convince Russia, first of all, and all other potential aggressors in the world that international law must be respected? What specific global decisions are needed to keep the weapons of mass destruction in the world under control and to prevent their use and relevant blackmail? Even talks about it. And what sanctions should be imposed for nuclear blackmail or blackmail with chemical weapons? And what will convince the world's politicians that these issues are urgent and practical, and not just for discussion? I hope you will offer your thoughts, answers to these questions. This is your experience. Because objectively, we all need answers, the world needs them. I am sure that every person who watches us now and who asks himself or herself these questions every day needs the answers. And I'm sure that the U24 tool we offer can be an important part of your answers. This is an option. We are talking about this, about our initiative. Because I believe that the more initiatives there are, the more people understand the global nature of these challenges, the global nature of these responses. Thank you very much for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Godan dag thetta er Volodymir Zelensky i Kaenugardi! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today in this format. It is a great honor for me to speak in the Althing, the oldest parliament in the free world. And what else can we talk about now, if not freedom - the most ancient value which people have fought for and continue to fight. Which we are fighting for now in Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine and Iceland actually have very close bonds. Our cultures have been well acquainted with one another for over a thousand years. Our ancestors easily found a common language, and this can be traced now in both our and your language. We live in different parts of Europe, in different conditions - natural, economic, and security. But we value the same things - in Kaenugardi and in Reykjavik. Undoubtedly, freedom. The land we rightfully own. And our own culture, which not only shows our identity, separating us from neighboring nations, but also maintains for us and our children a connection with all previous generations. All this in Ukraine is under Russian attack. What will be left of Ukraine if Russia succeeds in its war against our state? The Russian occupiers bring a tyranny that does not allow any freedom. They want to appropriate our land. They have been saying for a long time that Ukraine allegedly has no right to exist independently. And they want to erase any mention of our culture. Despite the fact that our culture has more than 1000-year-old roots! I know how people live in your country. What is remembered the most is your ability to organize social life in an objectively difficult and demanding natural environment so that happiness is felt, so that there is sufficient security for ordinary people, and so that a true democracy works. When we see your cities, your communities, your people, we see just that - how freedom works, how culture works. And what a good result they give on earth. In our part of Europe, natural conditions are objectively easier. More sun, probably more opportunities for agriculture, easier opportunities for contacts between people. We are not threatened by ocean storms and volcanic eruptions. It seems that nature itself here in Ukraine and in the neighboring countries tried to help people. But look at the full-scale war that is going on in our land. Take a look at what the Russian troops are doing. Even in such comfortable conditions, they managed to create hell. For what? This is all outright. For us to never have democracy. So that we never have independence. So that our land, our nature can be used against our interests. So that our resources work for another state. And so that our people are just a silent workforce. Please pay attention to one illustrative fact: more than 500,000 of our people have already been deported to Russia. They were forced to go there. Everything was taken away from them: documents, means of communication. They are sent to remote regions of foreign lands, remote regions of Russia. There is an attempt to assimilate them there. By force! 500,000 deported people. This is a large number. You know that - this is more than the total population of your beautiful country. Extraordinary scale of horror! I'm sure you know about the murder of tens of thousands of residents of our city of Mariupol by the Russian occupiers. I am sure you have heard about the war crimes that the Russian army is committing against our civilians, particularly in our city of Bucha. Wherever the occupiers come in Ukraine, they immediately start looking for everyone who worked for our state. Who served in our army. They are looking for journalists, they are looking for activists. They capture representatives of local self-government. That is, all those who can fight for freedom. On their land, on our land. In order to live freely, as people want, as our people want. Ladies and Gentlemen! It is obvious that Russia's war against Ukraine is not just an attempt to seize one country and destroy life in it. No! This is an encroachment on freedom as such. That is why it is important for all free people of the world that our country is not left alone in the confrontation with Russia. It is important that every nation helps. I am grateful to your people for the steps you have already taken, in particular by supporting sanctions against the Russian Federation. I am also grateful for the support you provide to our country at various levels. But I urge you not to stop. I call on your government, your diplomats and your people to advocate for increasing pressure on Russia. To be advocates of freedom. In all directions. No trade with tyranny. Above all, it is necessary to abandon Russian oil, oil blends and petroleum products. No financial ties with tyranny. No political help for tyranny. It doesn't matter if the country is big or small. When we defend freedom, the contribution of absolutely everyone matters. We in Ukraine definitely believe in victory. We are doing everything to drive out the invaders and liberate our land and our people. I can't tell the date when this will happen. But we are already preparing for the reconstruction of our country. And to ensure a truly free and comfortable life, to guarantee the well-being of our people, we invite our friends and only friends to participate with us in the implementation of Ukraine's reconstruction program. I invite your country, your companies to take part in the reconstruction of Ukraine, in particular in the energy modernization of our state. So that your energy efficiency experience also helps us, our people. I am sure we will be able to start this work soon. But first we will defend freedom. Our common freedom. We will do it. Thank you, Iceland! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! I wish you health! Today was a busy day, which began and ended with awarding our heroes, our defenders. On the occasion of Infantry Day - a professional holiday of Ukrainian warriors who are the foundation of the army, I met with our servicemen in the morning. Thanked them for their service. Presented awards. Including our new - combat - award. You know that since independence there have been no combat awards in our country. And today I had the honor to finally present such an award. The Cross of Military Merit. And the first person to whom I decided to present this Cross was General Valerii Zaluzhny, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For courage, for wisdom, for organizing an effective rebuff to the Russian invasion. I am sure the Russian army will remember such a rebuff for a long time. Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Yevhen Moysiuk, combat medic of the 72nd separate mechanized brigade, Sergeant Dariya Mazurenko, Commander of the 14th separate mechanized brigade, Colonel Oleksandr Okhrimenko, Deputy Commander of the mechanized battalion of the 72nd separate mechanized brigade, Captain Vladyslav Kaliyevsky received the same award.  Combat awards are a fair new tradition for the state, which defends its independence on the battlefield. A special award \"For Courage and Bravery\" was also established for combat units that showed extraordinary courage and effectiveness in the battles for Ukraine. It was received by 7 brigades. I also presented the Orders of the Golden Star to our defenders who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. And also to the relatives of those of our heroes who were posthumously awarded this title. We continue the evacuation mission from Mariupol, from Azovstal, with the mediation of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. During the day, our team organized rescue for more than 40 civilians - women and children. We hope that soon they will be able to arrive in a safe area after two months of shelling, just underground - in shelters. We are also working on diplomatic options to save our military who still remain at Azovstal. Influential mediators are involved. Influential states. Russian troops continued the shelling of our territory, including missile and air strikes. I ask all our citizens - especially these days - not to ignore the air raid sirens. Please, this is your life, the life of your children. Also, strictly follow the public order and curfew regulations in cities and communities. Be sure to comply with the ban on visiting forests in the territories that were occupied. A great threat of mines and tripwire mines left after the Russian military remains there. I met in Kyiv with the foreign ministers of the three Baltic states. They consistently support our struggle against the Russian invasion. Support from the first day. I am very grateful. And today, as always, we talked thoroughly and for the benefit of Ukraine. We are coordinating our steps to increase pressure on Russia. And this is especially important now - when the European Union is preparing a new, already sixth, sanctions package on Russia. I also took part in a discussion at the very influential British expert platform Chatham House. It is one of the most important international platforms for political work and lobbying - in the good sense of the word - useful government decisions. I have outlined our initiative to update the global security architecture. So that the tools for a really quick reaction to any external aggression finally appear in the world. Addressed the Parliament of Iceland. Thanked the Government and the people of Iceland for supporting the sanctions that are needed to deter Russia. I also called on Icelandic politicians, diplomats and ordinary citizens to help defend our freedom. Urged them to be advocates of freedom. Advocates of Ukraine. Because we have a common freedom with them. Just as with all other nations of the free world. This is the extraordinary strength of the Ukrainian position. We defend ourselves against the onslaught of tyranny craving to destroy everything that freedom gives to people and states. And such a struggle - for freedom and against tyranny - is quite comprehensible for any society, in any corner of our planet. In the evening I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. Our brave defenders thanks to whom Ukraine has survived and is holding on despite everything that Russia is trying to do to break us. Therefore, 203 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded. And 16 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate. Once again, I congratulate all warriors in infantry units on their professional holiday. Glory to all our defenders! Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! Last night, the Russian army fired a missile to destroy the Hryhorii Skovoroda Museum in the Kharkiv region. A missile. To destroy the museum. Museum of the philosopher and poet who lived in the XVIII century. Who taught people what a true Christian attitude to life is and how a person can get to know himself. Well, it seems that this is a terrible danger for modern Russia - museums, the Christian attitude to life and people's self-knowledge. Every day of this war, the Russian army does something that is beyond words. But every next day it does something that makes you feel it in a new way. Targeted missile strikes at museums - this is not even every terrorist can think of. But such an army is fighting against us. This is what they want to bring to other European countries. As of May 7, the Russian army destroyed or damaged nearly 200 cultural heritage sites already. Today, the invaders launched a missile strike at Odesa. At a city where almost every street has something memorable, something historical. But for the Russian army, it doesn't matter. They would only kill and destroy. Odesa? Kharkiv region? Donbas? They do not care. Only the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the resistance of our people can stop this inhuman invasion. It's barbarism that has missiles, but has nothing to do with people. Such actions of the Russian occupiers, especially on the eve of the Day of Remembrance of all victims of World War II and the Day of Victory over Nazism, should remind every state and every nation that it is impossible to defeat evil once and for all. Unfortunately, evil tends to return when people disrespect other people's rights, disregard the law and destroy culture. This is exactly what happened to the Russian state. That is why we all have to defend ourselves now. Defend our people, our cities and even our museums, which are becoming targets for Russian missile strikes. I am grateful to the teams of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations for helping us carry out the first phase of the Azovstal evacuation mission. More than 300 people were saved - women and children. Virtually, we evacuated civilians from Azovstal. And we are now preparing the second stage of the evacuation mission - the wounded and medics. Of course, if everyone fulfills the agreements. Of course, if there are no lies. Of course, we are also working to evacuate our military. All heroes who defend Mariupol. This is extremely difficult. But it is important. I'm sure everyone understands the root cause of this complication, as well as where the cause is located. But we do not lose hope. We do not stop. Every day we are looking for a diplomatic option that can work out. Tomorrow, our team is preparing the further work of humanitarian corridors for all residents of Mariupol and surrounding settlements. I held a meeting today on the activities of the executive branch. The main issues are economic. In particular, on providing Ukrainians with fuel. On overcoming the fuel shortage that arose after Russian missiles destroyed our Kremenchuk plant and oil depots across the country. I heard reports on what is being done specifically to organize the supply of sufficient gasoline and other fuel types to Ukraine. The key task for government officials is to speed up the transportation of fuel from European ports to our consumers. The volume of such transportation should increase daily. I also heard a report from the Minister of Finance on the execution of the state budget. We are doing everything to ensure that the state fulfills all its social obligations despite the budget deficit and the deliberate destruction of our economy by the Russian army. The preparation of the Post-War Recovery Plan was also discussed. This is a very large-scale task. But I have no doubt that we will implement it. Today I was in Borodyanka, Kyiv region. Which is gradually returning to normal life. Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak together with Minister of Infrastructure Oleksandr Kubrakov inspected the restored railway bridge over the Irpin River - it is already open for transport. Today we can say that the cities and communities of the Kyiv region liberated from the occupiers are provided with normal transport connections. I also traditionally signed decrees in the evening to award our defenders. 216 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Oleh Irodiyovych Hehechkora (posthumously), Commander of the helicopter squadron of the 11th separate brigade of the army aviation of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Eternal glory to all who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Can spring be black and white? Is there eternal February? Are golden words devalued? Unfortunately, Ukraine knows the answers to all these questions. Unfortunately, the answers are “yes”. Every year on May 8, together with the entire civilized world, we honor everyone who defended the planet from Nazism during World War II. Millions of lost lives, crippled destinies, tortured souls and millions of reasons to say to evil: never again! We knew the price our ancestors paid for this wisdom. We knew how important it is to preserve it and pass it on to posterity. But we had no idea that our generation would witness the desecration of the words, which, as it turned out, are not the truth for everyone. This year we say \"Never again\" differently. We hear \"Never again\" differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it. On February 24, the word \"never\" was erased. Shot and bombed. By hundreds of missiles at 4 am, which woke up the entire Ukraine. We heard terrible explosions. We heard: again! The city of Borodyanka is one of the many victims of this crime! Behind me is one of many witnesses! Not a military facility, not a secret base, but a simple nine-story building. Can it pose a security threat to Russia, to 1\/8 of the land, the world's second army, a nuclear state? Can anything be more absurd than this question? It can. 250kg high explosive bombs, with which the superpower shelled this small town. And it went numb. It cannot say today: never again! It cannot say anything today. But here everything is clear without words. Just look at this house. There used to be walls here. They once had photos on them. And in the photos there were those who once went through the hell of war. Fifty men who were sent to Germany for forced labor. Those who were burned alive when the Nazis burned more than 100 houses here. 250 soldiers who died on the fronts of World War II, and a total of almost 1000 residents of Borodyanka who fought and defeated Nazism. To ensure: never again. They fought for the future of children, for the life that was here until February 24. Imagine people going to bed in each of these apartments. They wish good night to each other. Turn off the light. Hug their loved ones. Close their eyes. They dream of something. There is complete silence. They all fall asleep, not knowing that not everyone will wake up. They sleep soundly. They have a dream of something pleasant. But in a few hours they will be awakened by missile explosions. And someone will never wake up again. Never again. The word \"never\" was dropped from this slogan. Amputated during the so-called special operation. They stabbed a knife in the heart and, looking into the eyes, said: \"It's not us!\" Tortured with the words \"not everything is so unambiguous.\" Killed \"Never again\", saying: \"We can repeat.\" And so it happened. And the monsters began to repeat. And our cities, which survived such a heinous occupation that 80 years are not enough to forget about it, saw the occupier again. And got the second date of occupation in their history. And some cities, such as Mariupol, got the third. During the two years of occupation, the Nazis killed 10,000 civilians there. In two months of occupation, Russia killed 20,000. Decades after World War II, darkness returned to Ukraine. And it became black and white again. Again! Evil has returned. Again! In a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose. A bloody reconstruction of Nazism was organized in Ukraine. A fanatical repetition of this regime. Its ideas, actions, words and symbols. Maniacal detailed reproduction of its atrocities and \"alibi\", which allegedly give an evil sacred purpose. Repetition of its crimes and even attempts to surpass the \"teacher\" and move him from the pedestal of the greatest evil in human history. Set a new world record for xenophobia, hatred, racism and the number of victims they can cause. Never again! It was an ode of a wise man! Anthem of the civilized world! But someone sang out of tune. Distorted \"Never again\" with notes of doubt. Silenced, beginning his deadly aria of evil. And this is clear to all countries that have seen the horrors of Nazism with their own eyes. And today they are experiencing a terrible deja vu. See it again! All nations who have been branded \"third-class\", slaves without the right to their own state or to exist at all hear statements that exalt one nation and erase others with ease. They claim that you don't really exist, you are artificially created, and therefore you have no rights. Everyone hears the language of evil. Again! And together they acknowledge the painful truth: we have not withstood even a century. Our Never again was enough for 77 years. We missed the evil. It was reborn. Again and now! This is understood by all countries and nations who support Ukraine today. And despite the new mask of the beast, they recognized him. Because, unlike some, they remember what our ancestors fought for and against. They did not confuse the first with the second, did not change their places, did not forget. The Poles didn’t forget, on whose land the Nazis began their march and fired the first shot of World War II. Didn't forget how evil first accuses you, provokes you, calls you an aggressor, and then attacks at 4:45 am saying it's self-defense. And they saw how it repeated on our land. They remember the Nazi-destroyed Warsaw. And they see what was done to Mariupol. The British people did not forget how the Nazis wiped out Coventry, which was bombed 41 times. How the \"Moonlight Sonata\" from the Luftwaffe sounded, when the city was continuously bombed for 11 hours. How its historic center, factories, St. Michael's Cathedral were destroyed. And they saw missiles hit Kharkiv. How its historic center, factories and the Assumption Cathedral were damaged. They remember London being bombed for 57 nights in a row. Remember how V-2 hit Belfast, Portsmouth, Liverpool. And they see cruise missiles hit Mykolaiv, Kramatorsk, Chernihiv. They remember how Birmingham was bombed. And they see its sister city Zaporizhzhia being damaged. The Dutch remember this. How Rotterdam became the first city to be completely destroyed when the Nazis dropped 97 tons of bombs on it. The French remember this. Remember Oradour-sur-Glane, where the SS burned half a thousand women and children alive. Mass hangings in Tulle, the massacre in the village of Ascq. Thousands of people at a resistance rally in occupied Lille. They saw what was done in Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Volnovakha and Trostyanets. They see the occupation of Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk and other cities where people do not give up. And thousands of them go to peaceful rallies, which are beyond the power of the occupiers, and all they can do is shoot at civilians. The Czechs have not forgotten this. How in less than a day, the Nazis destroyed Lidice, leaving only ashes from the village. They saw Popasna destroyed. There are not even ashes left from it. The Greeks, who survived massacres and executions throughout the territory, the blockade and the Great Famine, have not forgotten. This is remembered by Americans who fought evil on two fronts. Who passed Pearl Harbor and Dunkirk with the Allies. And together we are going through new, no less difficult battles. This is remembered by all Holocaust survivors - how one nation can hate another. Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Danes, Georgians, Armenians, Belgians, Norwegians and many others have not forgotten this - all those who suffered from Nazism on their land and all those who defeated it in the anti-Hitler coalition. Unfortunately, there are those who, having survived all these crimes, having lost millions of people who fought for victory and gained it, have desecrated the memory of them and their feat today. The one who allowed the shelling of the cities of Ukraine from his land. The cities that, along with our ancestors, were liberated by his ancestors. The one who spat in the face of his \"Immortal Regiment\", placing torturers from Bucha next to it. And challenged all mankind. But forgot the main thing: any evil always ends the same - it ends. Fellow Ukrainians! Today, on the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, we pay homage to all those who defended their homeland and the world from Nazism. We note the feat of the Ukrainian people and their contribution to the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition. Explosions, shots, trenches, wounds, famine, bombing, blockades, mass executions, punitive operations, occupation, concentration camps, gas chambers, yellow stars, ghettos, Babyn Yar, Khatyn, captivity, forced labor. They died so that each of us knows what these words mean from books, not from our own experience. But it happened differently. This is unfair to them all. But the truth will win. And we will overcome everything! And the proof of this is called \"Werewolf\". This is Hitler's former headquarters and bunker near Vinnytsia. And all that is left of it is a few stones. Ruins. The ruins of a person who considered himself great and invincible. This is a guide for all of us and future generations. What our ancestors fought for. And proved that no evil can avoid responsibility. Will not be able to hide in the bunker. There will be no stone left of it. So we will overcome everything. And we know this for sure, because our military and all our people are descendants of those who overcame Nazism. So they will win again. And there will be peace again. Finally again! We will overcome the winter, which began on February 24, lasts on May 8, but will definitely end, and the Ukrainian sun will melt it! And we will meet our dawn together with the whole country. And family and loved ones, friends and relatives will be together again! Finally again! And over the temporarily occupied cities and villages our flag will fly again. Finally again! And we will get together. And there will be peace! Finally again! And no more black and white dreams, only a blue and yellow dream. Finally again! Our ancestors fought for this. Eternal honor to all who fought against Nazism! Eternal memory to all those killed during World War II!"

  "speech": "I would like to thank you for the invitation. Mr. Chancellor, thank you. I am thankful to all the respected leaders for this opportunity and for the fact that it is happening today, on this day exactly. This is a powerful support for our state. Dear friends! We are meeting on this day in such a format to determine what needs to be done to stop Russia's war against Ukraine. Today, May 8, is a key day of remembrance for all the victims of World War II, for the fragility of peace and the inadmissibility of any anti-humanist regimes. But what is remembrance for others today, for our people is, unfortunately, just news, every day. Just yesterday in the village of Bilohorivka, Luhansk region, a Russian bomb killed 60 people. Civilians. They were hiding from shelling in the building of a regular school, which was attacked by a Russian air strike. To do so is to imitate precisely the evil that the Nazis brought to Europe. The missile strikes at Odesa and our other cities are an imitation of how the Nazis tried to bomb and destroy European cities by bombardment. The deportation of more than 500,000 Ukrainians to Russia and the so-called \"filtration camps\" set up by Russian troops in the occupied territories of Ukraine are imitations of the deportations and concentration camps that the Nazis organized in Europe. Every day our people see and die from what must have been left in the distant past. What definitely shouldn’t have returned to Europe 77 years after. But, unfortunately, I state: it's back. That is why the solidarity of the whole free world has returned. That is why such historical concepts as \"Lend-Lease\" and \"Marshall Plan\" have returned. I am grateful to the United States and our European colleagues for these initiatives. That is why we are reunited in an anti-war coalition to save democracy and freedom in Europe, to guarantee peace and security. I am grateful to you for this solidarity and for this unification. But what do we need now to gain victory in defending freedom? Freedom of Ukraine and the whole world? First of all, weapons. I am grateful to you for the defensive assistance we have already received. Because, as in World War II, the fate of freedom is decided on the battlefield. So Ukraine must get all the weapons and all the defense equipment that will help defeat tyranny. In particular, the M142 HIMARS, M270 MLRS and other weapons that Ukraine has requested from your powerful states. If we had them, we would have been able to save many people. In all those cities, in all those communities that fell victim to the Russian occupiers, like Bilohorivka, which I mentioned at the beginning, or Mariupol. The second is sanctions. Ukraine will always be grateful to you for unprecedented sanctions in the interests of peace. But the war still continues. Hence, a special international group of experts chaired by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak has developed an Action Plan to strengthen sanctions on Russia for this war. It is necessary - I beg you - to implement these sanctions and at least give your feedback. No export-import operations with Russia! As long as Russia is spending the money it has earned on destroying freedom in Ukraine and throughout Europe. The democratic world must be principled in defending itself. We need to look for ways to influence those politicians and those companies that help Russia circumvent sanctions. For example, we transport oil to Hungary through our pipeline. And the politicians of this country not only block the supply of fuel to our territory, but also try to slow down every sanction step against Russia, including the oil embargo. The free world must not allow itself to be manipulated. Also, all Russian officials, law enforcement officials and, importantly, judges who work for tyranny must be on the sanctions list. They are not there yet. Every Russian war criminal must be brought to justice and convicted through international cooperation. Visa restrictions are also needed for Russian citizens so that they do not use the free world for entertainment and shopping. Everyone must fight against tyranny, not adapt to it. The third important point is financial support for Ukraine now and post-war reconstruction. Just as the Marshall Plan played a historic role in rebuilding Europe and creating new conditions for development and growth after World War II, a similar Plan is needed and it is needed now. For the world to see that freedom wins not only on the battlefield, but also in life. As long as the war continues, we need $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion a month in support. When the war is over, we will have to rebuild everything destroyed by Russia for a sum exceeding $ 600 billion. This is a lot for our state. This is not possible for Ukraine. But this is possible for you. And it's not just expenditures for you. Financial assistance to Ukraine and assistance with post-war reconstruction is the prevention of much greater losses of the free world in the future. Russia wants to move on to Europe, and all the potential aggressors in the world, who also want to ruin the lives of their neighbors, are looking to see if Russia succeeds now and if they are able to repeat it. We must organize the work on the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war so that the best experience of democratic countries can be applied with maximum efficiency. In particular, we invite the friends of Ukraine to join the reconstruction, taking patronage over the regions, cities or industries in our country that have suffered from the war, that are destroyed. For example, the United Kingdom has already been invited to take patronage over the restoration of the de-occupied Kyiv region. And today, given Germany's presidency in the G7, I propose to apply the format of cooperation that has shown its effectiveness in the unification of the German state. When it is clearly set who is involved in the restoration and reintegration of the normal life of each region, each city, each community it guarantees efficiency. Such cooperation will strengthen economic and technological ties in Europe and will benefit not only our country, but also your countries, your regions and your companies. I am also grateful to the European Union and the United Kingdom for their decision to abolish tariffs and quotas on our trade. This is a powerful step in support of our state and freedom in general. And this is the decision that would be fair to expect from our other partners. I appeal to all participants of the G7. It is time to remove bilateral barriers in trade. Everything I have said now is, in fact, elements of one question. The question is how long this war will last and how much destruction, how many victims Ukraine will suffer. We must do everything we can to end the war as soon as possible with the victory of freedom. For the longer the war, the greater the benefits of tyranny and the greater the loss of freedom. And not only in Ukraine, but throughout Europe. The lives of more than ten million people in Ukraine who have become IDPs have already been destroyed. But the world is also on the verge of a food crisis because of Russia's actions. The Chancellor also spoke about this now. So how many more millions of lives will be lost in dozens of countries in Africa and Asia as a result of food shortages and political chaos that will follow rising food prices? We need an effective tool for the world's food security. And we propose to create it. If we have an Organization of grain exporting countries that respect international law, value democracy and strive to protect human rights, including the right to life and guaranteed well-being, we will be able to provide food stability and a historic victory over famine. Ukraine is ready to present all the details of this proposal at the appropriate working level. Friends! I commend the efforts of each of you. I am grateful to each of you for the weapons, sanctions and support. But I'm sure you realize that we need more weapons, more sanctions, more support to guarantee the protection of freedom. And to fix security for decades by concluding a relevant effective agreement with clear guarantees for Ukraine. I offer your states - the world's largest democracies - to become guarantors of security for Ukraine. Because this is what guarantees security for the whole center and east of Europe. Therefore, guarantees the confidence of your people that freedom always wins. Thanks again to every country, to every leader present. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders. Today is an important day, very important. For us. For our people. For our freedom. It was here, at the Mariyinsky Palace, that I held talks today with my friend, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. I am grateful to Justin for visiting our country. Exactly now, exactly on this day. A powerful sign of support and faith in the future of our people. The Ukrainian and Canadian delegations held bilateral talks. We agreed to expand economic and defense cooperation. We have an extremely important decision by Canada to remove all barriers to trade for one year. Thank you, Canada. This agreement was reached in negotiations with Mr. Trudeau and will work in the interests of both the Ukrainian and Canadian people. Among other things, Canada has a strong potential in mine clearance. We expect that this potential will be used in Ukraine - where the Russian occupiers left thousands of mines, tripwire mines, shells. In the presence of Mr. Prime Minister, I awarded our sappers today. In particular, a small but very famous sapper - Patron. A dog who helps clean our land from the traces of the occupiers. And who also helps teach children mine safety. Due to the Russian invaders, this is now one of the most urgent tasks - to teach children to recognize and avoid explosive objects. This is the \"liberation\" from a safe life for Ukrainian children that Russia has brought to Ukraine. For the first time, Ukraine took part in a meeting of G7 leaders. The world's largest democracies. I outlined our vision of what needs to be done for freedom to win and to guarantee Ukraine's security. I called for increasing sanctions on Russia and creating conditions for Ukraine so that the war ends as soon as possible with the liberation of our land and our people. In particular, this applies to the embargo on Russian oil, oil blends and petroleum products. I invited the leading states - our friends - to take part in the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. We agreed on a joint statement by the G7 on the war, global threats posed by Russia and our respect for the common historical heritage, our common values and the importance of freedom. The statement is in the interests of Ukraine as much as possible and will become the basis of our further cooperation. And the main thing I felt today was the world's even greater willingness to help us. And the fact that we have already achieved a historic result, because it is clear to the whole free world that Ukraine is the party of good in this war. And Russia will lose, because evil always loses. I am grateful to the First Lady of the United States Jill Biden for her visit to Ukraine, to Uzhhorod today. For security reasons, this visit and meeting with the First Lady of Ukraine was not announced in advance, and journalists were not invited. But I know that Mrs. Biden has received as much information as possible about what Ukrainian men and women need now. And I am grateful to her for the sincere support of our people. I held talks with Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenković in Kyiv. Croatia fundamentally and strongly supports our state in the struggle for independence. I am grateful to Croatia for everything we have already received. And I hope that in the future the cooperation will only grow. I also had a meeting with the President of the Norwegian Storting in Kyiv. The conversation was very emotional, so that you feel: they are worried about us, our fate as about themselves. And really try to help. I am grateful for that. I also spoke with the President of the German Bundestag. First of all, about Germany's further defensive assistance in our fight against tyranny. About how German leadership in the European Union can help us. Bono, U2, also visited Ukraine today. I am grateful to him for supporting our people and drawing even more attention to the need to help our people. Well, I am sure that this day in Ukraine has shown that we are already a full-fledged part of the free world and a united Europe. This is an obvious contrast to Moscow's loneliness in evil and hatred that everyone will see tomorrow. The Russian army would not be itself if it did not kill today - on the eve of certainly important days for any European. As a result of the Russian air strike at Bilohorivka, Luhansk region, about 60 people were killed. Civilians who simply hid in the school from the shelling. It was a targeted strike at the school. Another crime of the occupiers. Another missile strike at the Odesa region, again hitting a residential building. Again shelling in the Sumy region. Violent shelling in Donbas and the Kharkiv region. As if today is not May 8. As if tomorrow is not May 9, when peace should be the main word. For all normal people. Russia has forgotten everything that was important to the victors of World War II. But Ukraine and the whole free world will remind it. So that then no one will forget. So that really important words - \"never again\" - which are repeated all over the free world every year on the days of remembrance of the victims of World War II regain their weight again. I am grateful to all our defenders who are defending and saving Ukraine from the modern descendants of that old evil. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal glory to all our warriors! I am grateful to all the friends of Ukraine and freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Great people of great Ukraine! On August 24, 2021, the whole country celebrated the 30th anniversary of our independence! Our soldiers, our defenders, our equipment were moving along the Khreshchatyk, our \"Mriya\" was flying in the sky! \"There is nothing more dangerous than an insidious enemy, but there is nothing more poisonous than a feigned friend.\" These are the words of the great Ukrainian philosopher Hryhorii Skovoroda. On February 24, we realized this truth when a feigned friend started a war against Ukraine. This is not a war of two armies. This is a war of two worldviews. The war waged by barbarians who shell the Skovoroda Museum and believe that their missiles can destroy our philosophy. It annoys them. It is unfamiliar to them. It scares them. Its essence is that we are free people who have their own path. Today we are waging war on this path and we will not give anyone a single piece of our land. Today we celebrate the Day of Victory over Nazism. And we will not give anyone a single piece of our history. We are proud of our ancestors who, together with other nations in the anti-Hitler coalition, defeated Nazism. And we will not allow anyone to annex this victory, we will not allow it to be appropriated. Our enemy dreamed that we would refuse to celebrate May 9 and the victory over Nazism. So that the word \"denazification\" gets a chance. Millions of Ukrainians fought Nazism and went through a difficult and long journey. The Nazis were expelled from Luhansk, the Nazis were expelled from Donetsk, and Kherson, Melitopol and Berdyansk were liberated from the occupiers. The Nazis were expelled from Yalta, Simferopol, Kerch and the entire Crimea. Mariupol was liberated from the Nazis. They expelled the Nazis from all over Ukraine, but the cities I named are especially inspiring us today. They give us faith that we will drive the occupiers out of our own land for sure. On the Day of Victory over Nazism, we are fighting for a new victory. The road to it is difficult, but we have no doubt that we will win. What is our advantage over the enemy? We are smarter by one book. This is a textbook on the history of Ukraine. We would not know grief if all our enemies could read and draw the right conclusions. On February 24, Russia launched an offensive. Treading on the same rake. Every occupier who comes to our land treads on it. We have been through different wars. But they all had the same final. Our land was sown with bullets and shells, but no enemy was able to take root here. Enemy chariots and tanks drove through our fields, but it did not bear fruit. Enemy arrows and missiles flew in our skies, but no one will be able to overshadow our blue sky. There are no shackles that can bind our free spirit. There is no occupier who can take root in our free land. There is no invader who can rule over our free people. Sooner or later we win. Despite the horde, despite Nazism, despite the mixture of the first and the second, which is the current enemy, we win, because this is our land. Because someone is fighting for the father tsar, the führer, the party and the chief, and we are fighting for the Homeland. We have never fought against anyone. We always fight for ourselves. For our freedom. For our independence. So that the victory of our ancestors was not in vain. They fought for freedom for us and won. We are fighting for freedom for our children, and therefore we will win. We will never forget what our ancestors did in World War II. Where more than eight million Ukrainians died. And every fifth Ukrainian didn’t return home. In total, the war claimed at least 50 million lives. We do not say \"we can repeat\". Because only a madman can wish to repeat the 2194 days of war. The one who is repeating the horrific crimes of Hitler’s regime today, following Nazi philosophy, copying everything they did. He is doomed. Because he was cursed by millions of ancestors when he began to imitate their killer. And therefore he will lose everything. And very soon there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine. And someone will not have even one left. We won then. We will win now, too! And Khreshchatyk will see the parade of victory - the victory of Ukraine! Congratulations on the Victory Day over Nazism! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Unbreakable people of our country! Today, we have taken another step - a very important and not just a formal step - on our path to the European Union. Ukraine has submitted the second part of the answers to a special questionnaire to be completed by each country aspiring to be part of the European Union. It usually takes months. But we did everything in a few weeks. This is a document that contains thousands of pages. And it was today that I held talks about our European integration with both Charles Michel, President of the European Council, and Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. I thanked them on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for their support for our country. For attention to our needs and especially now - in this difficult time of war. They are well aware that this war is not only for our freedom, but also for the freedom of all Europeans. Mrs. Ursula said she was impressed with the speed with which our government officials filled out the questionnaire. And I was glad to hear from her that our speed encourages the European Commission to act just as quickly. We expect to receive a positive response in June regarding the acquisition of EU candidate status by our country. I also thanked the President of the European Commission for the work on creating a Trust Fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war, after the victory. And for the efforts needed to agree on a new package of sanctions on Russia. President Charles Michel visited our Odesa today. He saw with his own eyes what the blocked sea means. For the first time in decades there is no usual movement of the merchant fleet, no usual port functioning in Odesa. Probably this has never happened in Odesa since World War II. Ordinary life related to the sea is blocked by Russia. Exactly Russia. And this affects not only Ukraine. Without our agricultural exports, dozens of countries in different parts of the world are already on the brink of food shortages. And over time, the situation can become downright terrible. Politicians are already discussing the possible consequences of the price crisis and famine in Africa and Asia. This is a direct consequence of Russian aggression, which can be overcome only together - by all Europeans, by the whole free world. It can be overcome by putting pressure on Russia, by effectively forcing Russia to stop this disgraceful war. And, by the way, today - despite the presence of the President of the European Council - the Russian military again launched a missile strike at the Odesa region. This is the real attitude of Russia to Europe. And it has always been so. Whatever they say in Moscow. I met in Kyiv with Secretary General of the Council of Europe Marija Pejčinović Burić. We discussed what can be done for peace in Ukraine and Europe with the tools of this esteemed institution. I am grateful for the support of our state by visiting our capital on this day. Europe Day. And Day of Victory over Nazism. Usually on May 9, Europeans recalled the price of peace that was paid by all the nations of our continent 77 years ago. They talked about how to prevent the recurrence of such a terrible war. It is clear that now everything is different. In European capitals, the main topic is the price of peace that will have to be paid to stop the war unleashed by Russia. And also the price for Russia for bringing the evil of total war of destruction of our people to Europe again. I'm sure this is also the main topic in Moscow now. They can show anything in propaganda - let it be. And make any political statements. But the reality cannot be changed. Reality requires peace. And the only culprit that peace has been destroyed is and will be the Russian state. This is a historical responsibility of Russia. Well, we, Ukrainians, continue to work for our defense, victory and restoration of justice. Today, tomorrow and any other day needed for the liberation of Ukraine from the occupiers. I am grateful to all our defenders. I am grateful to all those who defend the Kharkiv region, defend Donbas, defend the south of Ukraine. Who do not give up and are waiting for the Ukrainian flag in all those cities that are temporarily - I emphasize this: temporarily - captured by the occupiers. Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol, all other cities, all our other communities. The Ukrainian flag will return. Because this is our country. Free European country. Our state. Glory to Ukraine!"

It is an honor for me to address you today. And I want to start with words of gratitude for all the help that Slovakia has given to Ukraine. We greatly appreciate your defense support. And your determination in this support, which proves that you realize that freedom without force is just a fantasy and nothing more. It would be good if some other countries in Europe and the world learn this from you. We appreciate your solidarity with Ukraine at the level of the European Union. This was the case before February 24, when Russia launched a full-scale war and so it is now. Last year, we, with your President, Ms. Zuzana Čaputová, signed a Declaration of Recognition of the European Perspective of Ukraine. The significance of that step has now only grown stronger. Russia's war against our state is not only an attempt to seize our land, subdue our people and erase Ukrainian identity. Russia went to war in fact against all of united Europe, starting with Ukraine. This war is actually being waged by Russia against each of the states that want to live freely and choose their own future. That want to choose which unions to be in, who to be friends with and how to trade. This war is against the very project of a common alliance based on common values on our continent. What are these values? Respect for life, human rights, inviolability of borders and freedom. The Prime Minister of Slovakia, Mr. Eduard Heger, was one of our first foreign friends to visit the suburbs of Kyiv and see with his own eyes what the Russian occupiers have done there. Last week, Bucha and Borodyanka were also visited by your colleagues from the Slovak Parliament. They also saw with their own eyes what evil Russia is carrying. Thousands of crimes by Russian occupiers against civilians have been recorded in the Kyiv region alone. Murders, torture, abductions, looting and robberies have been reported. It is recorded that the occupiers tried to destroy everything that is connected not only with the Ukrainian national idea, but also simply with culture. What is the point of shelling and destroying schools in the area where the occupiers entered? They even destroyed schools! What does this mean? That we are at the epicenter of the confrontation of two ideas: the European democratic idea that the freedom and life of everyone matters and the cruel tyrannical idea that only a person who can subdue other people matters. That's what we need to stop together. Everyone in Europe. Because if we don't stop it, Russian troops will repeat the crimes they committed in Bucha and Borodyanka on the land of every state they can reach, in particular on the territory of your state. So the first and foremost tool to win this confrontation is weapons. And I can say on behalf of all our people that Ukrainians will always remember how Slovakia gave our country at a crucial time what really helped us. And there is potential to continue this cooperation, in particular, in the issue of aviation – aircraft, helicopters. You know, our flag, which is now very often seen by all Europeans in their cities – I am grateful to them – it reflects our fertile land – fields of yellow wheat. And also our beautiful blue sky. We have people to defend our land. But in the skies we need more support, including yours. The second tool is sanctions against Russia. Together with the use of effective weapons by our Armed Forces, sanctions create a truly reliable protection for the European idea. Because if the source of aggression weakens, life becomes more secure for everyone in Europe. The European Union is now agreeing on the sixth package of sanctions against Russia. And this is the required package, including the energy restrictions that are provided for in it. I understand that this is a challenge for you and some other countries. For Slovakia, the issue of Russian oil and the possibility of its replacement is not a matter of immediate action. We understand everything. But I want to give you, as our friends, one Ukrainian example. To make you better understand us. For a long time, Russian politicians have been fighting for the supply of Russian gas to Ukraine. They offered various supposedly profitable options – completely non-market, cheap and convenient, especially for Moscow. They offered to get a political decision from us about a larger volume of supplies and an easier scheme of payment for Russian gas. Not so long ago, Ukraine was one of the biggest sales destinations for Gazprom. What did it lead to? Ukraine depended not only on Russian gas, but also on Russian political decisions. And any attempt to move at least to market conditions in supply ended in gas wars, and ultimately in a bonded gas agreement, which posed a direct threat to our sovereignty. Ukrainian politicians have also been playing for a long time with the issue of placing the Russian Black Sea Fleet on the territory of Ukraine – in our Crimea. In particular, they talked about the conditions of the so-called lease for the fleet, linking the gas issue to this. It seems that there may be some benefit to the state from the feigned discount on Russian gas when the Russian fleet remains on Ukrainian territory. While this fleet was just a cover to capture a territory. An umbrella for issuing passports to our people by Russia – our people in Crimea. For propaganda and creeping annexation, which could only be completed by the invasion, and it happened in 2014. That's what happened in our history. And this is what I advise all our friends, who may become at least one percent more politically dependent on Russia, to avoid. We were the first to see Russia breaking agreements when it simply stopped liking them. We saw Russia turn commercial ties into a chain to keep another state close to it. The Russian Black Sea Fleet was used to capture Crimea. And now it is blocking the sea for us and firing missiles at our peaceful cities. Well, Russia is trying to use gas now to have the entire European continent obedient. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Slovak people! Ukraine has gone through the mistakes that our friends can learn. Russian energy is not just a commodity. It should be abandoned, especially oil, because it's really a question of freedom. Yes, protecting freedom has a price. And the third aspect I would like to talk about today. This is the future of the European Union. Russia's attempts to blackmail, split and weaken Europeans clearly show that all of us on the continent must respond with even greater unity. Even greater integration. Even with greater joint protection of our values. This is an important element of the very force that makes freedom not just a fantasy. Even more unity in Europe is possible only in one case – if Ukraine right now, in the conditions of war, gets a real opportunity to move faster to the European Union. The issue of granting EU membership candidate status to Ukraine in June this year is a matter of protecting the entire European project. As well as the issue of economic support for Ukraine. It is impossible to fight without the economy. And Russia is doing everything to destroy our economy. As an example, most of the Russian missiles that hit Ukrainian land hit the economic infrastructure. Therefore, the priority is to establish alternative routes for our exports, in particular, through the territory of Slovakia. And greater financial support for Ukraine from the European Union. And I ask you to be our voice in the European Union when it comes to defending the relevant positions from the destructive doubts of those who value freedom less than you. After more than two months of the full-scale war, Ukrainians, together with all our friends on the European continent who have shown solidarity in defending freedom, have proved that Moscow will never be able to repeat what it did in 1968 and all other attempts to spread tyranny. By the way, this is how I interpret the decision to award me your State Award of Alexander Dubček. I am grateful for it. But to really fully respond to the mockery of freedom then, in 1968, and to the attempts to mock freedom now, we still have to fight. We must strengthen our unity and put pressure on Russia until we see that victory has been achieved. I know that a donors' conference will be held in Bratislava in June to activate assistance for Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who participates in its organization, including the GLOBSEC think tank. And I believe that we will be able to discuss specific projects to restore normal life in different regions of Ukraine at this Bratislava site. Because the more actively we cooperate, the more we put pressure on Russia. And the more we strengthen European unity, the clearer the contours of our victory are. Our victory. Thank you, Slovakia! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today has been a difficult day. There was news - both ordinary and tragic. I'll start with international contacts. I continued to address foreign parliaments. Those states and nations whose support is important to us. And especially now. In my address to the Slovak Parliament, I thanked for the strong defense, sanctions and other support. I explained our view on why energy cooperation with Russia cannot be considered in isolation from the aggressive policy of this country. And on the Ukrainian example, recalling the history of so-called gas friendship with Russia, I showed what mistakes should be avoided. Addressing the Maltese Parliament, I recalled the heroic battle for Malta in World War II, which is very similar in fact to our current struggle in the war for independence and freedom against Russia. Then, 80 years ago, the fate of the entire confrontation in the Mediterranean depended on the battle for Malta. The Allies won. The Nazis lost. We are doing everything to ensure that the confrontation on our land ends in this way now as well. And for this we need principled support and sanctions. In particular, from Malta. I held talks in Kyiv with the foreign ministers of Germany and the Netherlands. We talked about the strengthening of Ukraine, about the faster end of this war. We also discussed the details of how our friends can join the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. I am also grateful to them for resuming the work of embassies in our capital. This is an important gesture that confirms Europe's confidence in Ukraine's future. In total, 36 foreign missions are already operating in the capital. The Armed Forces of our state provided us all with good news from the Kharkiv region. The occupiers are gradually being pushed away from Kharkiv. I am grateful to all our defenders who are holding the line and demonstrating truly superhuman strength to drive out the army of invaders. Once the second most powerful army in the world. But I also want to urge all our people, and especially those in the rear, not to spread excessive emotions. We shouldn’t create an atmosphere of specific moral pressure, when certain victories are expected weekly and even daily. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to liberate our land and our people. To liberate all our cities - Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Mariupol and all others. Today, a special group of international experts chaired by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak proposed a roadmap for energy sanctions. This is a detailed document that describes what needs to be done to make it really difficult for Russia to finance this war, but at the same time - so that the global economy does not suffer losses due to restrictions on Russian energy resources. This is a rationally drafted document, and work has already begun on its implementation. And the tragic news on which I want to end this address today. The first President of Ukraine Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk died today. He was not just a politician. And not just a historical figure. He was the man who knew how to find wise words and say them so that all Ukrainians could hear them. This is especially important in difficult, crisis moments. When the future of an entire country may depend on the wisdom of one person. Leonid Makarovych showed just such wisdom in the late 1980s, when the Ukrainian movement emerged. He passed 1991 brilliantly, and it is only now that it may seem as if it was easy for him then. And no matter what happened later, Leonid Kravchuk always stayed with Ukraine. Perhaps it was because of his wisdom that he was cheerful in a special way. He always valued life, every minute of it. But he always found much more than one minute to help sort things out and give advice. And I am personally grateful to him in particular for that. As a child he survived World War II, survived the occupation. Leonid Makarovych knew what freedom costs. And with all his heart he wanted peace for Ukraine. I'm sure we will implement it. We will achieve our victory and our peace. Eternal honor and memory to the first President of independent Ukraine! Eternal memory to all who defended Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I am glad to greet you from our capital, from Kyiv. Today is the 77th day of Russia's full-scale war against our state. And it happens 77 years after the end of the largest war in Europe - World War II. When that war ended, political leaders and nations sought to create a security architecture that would make it impossible to repeat the war in Europe. And when I say the word \"security\" now, I use it in the broad sense of the word. It is not only a military component, but also economic, political, educational, cultural and memorial. Europeans have done a lot to ensure that the continent always has the opportunity to resolve any issues through dialogue. Through communication. So that it is not possible for one politician, one person or a group of politicians to provoke a large-scale war again, which will take thousands or even millions of lives. And, by the way, the contribution of students, including French students, to such changes in Europe is extremely significant. Since May 1968, there has been no politician who would not fear that people would come to him and say: it is forbidden to forbid. But why, despite all this, all this history, do we in Europe now have no tool to stop Russian aggression, except the courage and wisdom of Ukrainian men and women who defend our state? How did it happen that the whole security architecture that was created in Europe after World War II did not work? And not only did not work, but to a large extent did not even try. 77 days of brutal Russian war, which can truly be called a total war to destroy the Ukrainian people. Cities and villages in Ukraine were destroyed. You know this. There is nothing left of the city of Volnovakha in Donbas. Before this war about 20 thousand people lived there. Now it's all ashes. The half-million city of Mariupol is now just ruins. How many people are there now? Several tens of thousands out of half a million. At least 20,000 Mariupol residents were killed by Russian strikes at the city. Unfortunately, there are many such examples in Ukraine. Today, 12 million people have been forced to flee the war and become internally displaced persons. More than 10,000 Russian military crimes have been recorded. And this is just what is legally recorded as of this day. How did all this become possible? And why are no global or European institutions enough now to stop this war? You know, I don't want these questions to remain rhetorical. These questions really need to be answered, because these questions are actually about you and me, about Europe. About how we all live. From the Atlantic region to our cities, our communities in the Kharkiv region and in Donbas, which right now, right now, while we are here with you, are being fired upon by Russian troops from artillery, aircraft, and so on. I was told that the rules of our meeting today provide for my address and the opportunity for five students to ask certain questions. I think this is still an unfair regulation. Five questions are not enough to understand a person and to understand the situation. And it will look like a privilege for a few when thousands listen to us. But I understand that you and I have limited time. I'm also interested in asking you questions to hear what you think. So that it is really communication. For example, about NATO. About world security. About the architecture of this security. About the 5th article of the Treaty. For years, Europe has feared Ukraine's accession to NATO, because if a war broke out with Russia - they said so - everyone would have to fight against it. I would rather say - for Ukraine. But isn't that the point of NATO? Isn't that all for one? And if Russia goes further, for example to the Baltic countries, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia - any country. Will NATO fight against Russia, for example, for Latvia? Will Article 5 work then, given that most of you have never been to Latvia and may not even have ties to that country? There is also another aspect to this. Russia has already started a war against Ukraine, but we are not in NATO. And then why are we not in the European Union? Russia has already started a war. And you see how it fights. What else can you be afraid of now? And why does our common European home still have an internal division between those who were admitted and Ukraine? Which is behind the door, but at the same time fighting, defending European values, EU values: freedom and other fundamental values. And here is my second question to you: why did one person, Vladimir Putin, decide to start a war? It was a wrong and catastrophic decision. But why did he still approve it? And is there now in Europe, perhaps even in France or in any other country, a man or woman who can also start such a war against neighbors? Of course, I don't want that for anyone. But are we protected from this? Are you protected from this? One more question of mine to you - why did the Russian military, when occupying the territory of Ukraine, torment people with such pleasure and so massively? Why didn't they just shoot or capture or kill people like in war. Why did they rape, why did they torture people? Why did they cut off people's heads, fingers, why did they break legs? Why did Russian soldiers rape children in front of their parents? How can you - already adults - explain this? In your opinion, did they have just such an order or are they just like that? For example, a nine-year-old girl. Or an eleven-year-old boy. What should be in the head of a Russian soldier who rapes them in front of their parents, in front of their mother? Hundreds of such crimes have been recorded. There was even a Russian soldier who raped a baby and recorded a video of it, and then showed it to everyone. And how many such cases were in the occupied territories, about which we do not know yet? During World War II, the Nazis committed horrific crimes against all the nations of Europe. In particular, against Ukrainians and against Russians. For 77 years, much has been done to preserve the memory of those terrible crimes, which would ensure that they will never happen again. But why did the Russian military, when they came to Ukraine, start doing what the Nazis did? How did this become possible? My next question to you is: when will justice be restored? Why is there still no tool in the world that can bring all war criminals to justice quickly? Exactly quickly. Of course, our state will do everything to bring to justice every war criminal. And I am grateful to everyone who helps us. In particular, France. But there is an aspect of time. How long will it last? When will murderers and torturers receive sentences? And how to get them for trial, if they hide in Russia and if nothing changes there? There are many people of the future and different professions among you, and there are lawyers among you. Let them find the answer. So what can we do to speed up international justice? And what punishment do these criminals deserve? Specifically which one? What could be enough punishment for raping a child or shooting cars with refugees right on the roads just for fun? There were hundreds and thousands of such cases. And my fifth question to you is not difficult - personal. What influences politics and what influences the decision whether to engage in politics? Are you ready to get involved in politics? Would you like your father to be President? President of a state that defends itself in war and fights not just for independence, but literally for the right to life for its people? Or President of France - a state in peace? I want to explain my feelings to you. The feelings when you have a double responsibility - both for the state, because you are the President, and for your family, which found itself in a very special situation. When I decided to run for president, my daughter (she’s now 18) was against it - totally. She was aware of how much life would change. It is a question of publicity, a question of security, certain responsibility - of the children of the President already. What do you think about it? And how would you feel now if you were the son or daughter of the President? So, as I understand, we have little time. And I would like you to give answers to my questions. And I can answer yours. It is important for this meeting of ours to be truly communication. And I would like to hear from you. At the end, I can ask the last question. If I get all the information from you. Thank you for your attention!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Unbreakable people of our country! We have a series of important news - clearly positive for our defense. First. The House of Representatives of the United States Congress voted for a new and significant package of support for our state and global democracy. Almost $ 40 billion. A second vote will be held soon in the US Senate. This decision will then be signed by President Biden and will take effect. I am grateful to the people of America and to all our friends in Congress and Administration for their support. What exactly is positive? These funds will be used as quickly as possible and without bureaucracy to strengthen Ukraine's defense. First of all, it is weapons and ammunition for us, equipment. But not only that. It is also a support for the investigation of war crimes of the Russian Federation, the occupiers, support for diplomatic work and more. The second decision is important and even historic. This is an update of America's famous Lend-Lease program. People who remember history well know that Lend-Lease was one of the key preconditions for the Allied victory in World War II. Lend-Lease assistance from the United States to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union has dramatically changed the balance of power in Europe. Europeans then received a wide range of products under Lend-Lease - from aircraft to trucks, from aviation fuel to communication means. By the way, American radio stations and other things provided under Lend-Lease worked for the Soviet people long after the war. For decades. Hitler's Germany, even with all the resources in the occupied territories, could do nothing to counter this potential of the Allies on the basis of American productive capacities. And it is no coincidence that the new Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act was signed on May 9. I am personally grateful to President Biden for this support, for this decision and for such symbolism. Because we are now defending freedom and the right to life for all free nations in the war against tyranny, which poses no less of a threat to Europe than it did 80 years ago. Simply put, Lend-Lease is a scheme to give us everything we need for defense. Although formally it is like a loan, in fact it is so profitable that it is incorrect to call it a loan. Firstly, we will have access to modern weapons, ammunition, equipment, and we do not need to look for options to pay for it all. Secondly, now the President of the United States will not have to agree with Congress on the assistance he provides. This will speed up the delivery. And there is one more thing that should be said separately. Ukraine is constantly discussing security guarantees for itself with our friends in a very substantive way. The G7 meeting on May 8, in which our state took part for the first time at the level of leaders, was first and foremost about that. We are negotiating with the world's leading nations to give Ukraine confidence in security for decades to come. This is the first time in the history of our state when it is possible to fix such guarantees. Not something in the memorandum, not some declarative desire for some kind of course, but specific guarantees. Not only legally significant, but also spelled out so that it is clear: what exactly, who exactly and how exactly guarantees us. God willing. Of course, all these things will not work in one or several days. But I am sure that this May will be of special significance in Ukrainian history. Yes, Russian troops are still on our land. Those outcasts whom the Russian state has found for itself as collaborators make statements of cosmic scale and cosmic stupidity, as their level was characterized in \"Heart of a Dog\". But no matter what the occupiers do, it doesn't mean anything. They stand no chance. I am confident that we will liberate our land and people. By the way, today in communication with students of French universities I felt such confidence in their questions. And with new support from the United States, with Lend-Lease, with all the help we get from the UK and the European Union, from Canada, Japan, Australia – without exaggeration, from the whole free world – it will be easier for us. I also spoke today with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. On defense assistance to Ukraine, energy cooperation and new sanctions. New – against Russia. Step by step, we are doing everything to make the aggressor most hurt by aggression. However, speaking about the help of partners, we must not forget that victory is gained directly by Ukrainians who are fighting. By all who beat the enemy and strengthen the defense. Just yesterday, 404 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine (posthumously) was awarded to Colonel Ihor Bedzay, Chief of the Aviation Security Service - Senior Inspector-Pilot of the Naval Command. In total, more than 13,000 of our servicemen received state awards during the full-scale war. This definitely characterizes the courage of all our defenders. I am grateful to each and every one of them! Very grateful. Eternal glory to all who fight for freedom! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for us, for everyone. For Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! On behalf of all Ukrainians, I would like to thank you for this award. It is a fair and correct gesture to honor with this award all the people of Ukraine, because courage is our national trait of character. Today the whole world witnesses this and admires the heroism of Ukrainians. At the same time, I want it not to become something ordinary for everyone. And for this we must say and remember that behind the courage and wisdom of our people, there are thousands of real stories, names and heroic feats. The world should know about them and to have a clear idea and understanding about the people of Ukraine. First of all, we are the nation of the best defenders. These are our ground forces, air and naval forces, airborne assault troops, special operations forces, the National Guard, intelligence, border guards, and territorial defense fighters. This is Vitalii Skakun, who blew up a bridge sacrificing himself to stop a column of Russian tanks. This is 21-year-old lieutenant Vitalii Sapilo, who neutralized 30 units of equipment of the enemy and died from an air strike. Serhiy Pantelyuk, who was injured while repelling the attack and died at the hospital while his first daughter was being born. These are the border guards of Zmiinyi Island, who were not afraid of the flagship of the Russian fleet - cruiser Moskva - and sent a Russian ship in a direction that became world-famous. These are the indomitable defenders of Mariupol and Azovstal, who have been holding the line there for several months. These are all our fighters who died defending Ukraine, hence defending Europe. I would like to ask you to honor their memory with a moment of silence. Thank you. The Ukrainian people are people who do not spare themselves for the sake of others. This is combat medic Diana Kukurudziak, who pulled 16 wounded soldiers off the battlefield in one day. Paramedic Serhiy Chornobryvets in Mariupol, who has been on duty for 22 days since the beginning of the war. The Ukrainian people are a nation of courageous children. This is 11-year-old Maksym, who said nothing to his mother, ran away from home and came to ask for permission to be a part of territorial defense. This is 7-year-old Varya from Kropyvnytskyi who gave her money saved for a smartphone to buy bulletproof vests, and then sold flowers and drawings.  This is a 15-year-old girl from the Luhansk region who was driving a car with shot legs and took out four wounded. A 15-year-old boy who carried his wounded mother in his arms for 3 kilometers to the evacuation point. Our people are also elderly people who have experienced too many ordeals. This is Borys Romanchenko, who passed through the hell of Buchenwald and died at the age of 96, at home, during the shelling of Kharkiv by the Russian Federation. This is Vanda Obiedkova, who as a child, hiding in the basement, survived the Holocaust and the Nazi occupation of Mariupol, saw the second occupation of the city in 2014, and the third - this year. At the age of 91, she had to hide in the basement again, where she died on the 40th day of the war. This is 87-year-old Halyna Kotubey from Mykolaiv region, who remained the only and last resident of her village, but refused to leave. The Ukrainian people are a nation where hundreds of thousands fight and millions help. This is a business that has shifted to the needs of the country. Clothing designers sew military uniforms, restaurateurs feed free lunches, bakeries bake bread for IDPs and lonely people. This is a university professor who continues to lecture to his students in the trenches. A violinist playing for people during an air alarm in a bomb shelter. These are civilians of Ukrainian cities and villages, who became a living wall on the way of the occupiers – stopping military machines and turning tanks in the opposite direction. These are inhabitants of Demydivka, who flooded their own village not to let the occupier into Kyiv. Those who despite threats, shots and stun grenades go to peaceful rallies, reminding the occupants that this is Ukraine: Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all other cities and villages of Ukraine occupied not for a long time.  These are millions of Ukrainians who are now defending their Homeland and the whole world. Do not be afraid and come to Ukraine. Hear thousands of similar stories about us, Ukrainians. Look into their brave eyes, shake their strong hands, and you will see that they are doing all this not for glory, that they need not only awards, but also concrete help and support. Weapons, equipment, financial support, sanctions on Russia, and the most important: the feeling that in this difficult struggle they are not alone, that they are supported by you, by the whole world – free states and free nations of our planet. Thank you! Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Thank you for the award and welcome to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! I do not tire of repeating these words, addressing everyone - everyone who defends the state. Today these words sound special. On the International Nurses Day. The professional holiday of tens of thousands of Ukrainian women, as well as Ukrainian paramedic officers who are doing one of the most important things for victory - saving the lives of our soldiers, our civilians. Today I had the honor to present state awards to the representatives of this profession. Those who did not stop working and rescuing people under enemy fire and during the occupation. Tetiana Tarasenko, Alla Chernets and Liudmyla Husak from the Sumy region. Vira Tselyk, Oksana Umanets and Iryna Vernyhora from Chernihiv. Oksana Balandina from the Luhansk region. Svitlana Klymenko and Maria Adamenko from the Kyiv region. Natalia Abashnyk from Kharkiv. With all my heart I thank all the nurses, all the medical workers who help Ukrainians fight every day and every night. And today I urge everyone who has not yet thanked them to do so. Eight years of war in Donbas, two years of pandemic, the third month of full-scale war and all their professional life they dedicate to you, us, everyone - society. So that Ukraine lives. I was very pleased to see the working conditions of our doctors at the Center for Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery in Kyiv. The new building of the Center was built as part of our Large Construction program. And this is a truly modern building. There you feel that our medical system, our medicine can really be on a par with the world's best medical systems. We invested in the development of medicine and all social infrastructure before the war, and we will definitely continue to do so after the war. Let the occupiers not hope that they will stop us. During the fighting since February 24, Russian troops have destroyed 570 healthcare facilities. 101 hospitals were completely destroyed. What is it? This is nonsense. This is barbarism. This is the self-destruction of Russia as a state that at least someone in the world could look at as a cultural nation. Tonight they struck at the Chernihiv region, at schools. Of course, the Russian state is in such conditions that any education only hinders it. But what can be achieved by destroying Ukrainian schools? All Russian commanders who give such orders are just sick. Incurably. But all the hospitals that the occupiers destroyed, all the schools, all the universities that they bombed, all the houses, bridges, businesses - we will rebuild everything. The occupiers struck today at the Poltava region, at Kremenchuk. Again at the plant, so that people do not have fuel. Really sick. At the Zaporizhzhia region, at the cities and villages of Donbas. But what does it give them? Russia's strategic defeat is already obvious to everyone in the world and even to those who still continue to communicate with them. Russia simply lacks courage to admit it so far. They are cowards. And they are trying to hide the truth behind missile, air and artillery strikes. Therefore, our task is to fight until we achieve our goals in this war. Free our land, our people and reliably ensure our security. I spoke with the President of Finland. We discussed Ukraine's European integration and defense cooperation. I also spoke with Slovak President Zuzana Čaputová. I thanked her for the support provided to Ukraine. We agreed on the next steps in the whole spectrum of relations: defense, sanctions, economy, including fuel imports, and further rapprochement with the European Union. I am preparing to continue special formats of communication with friendly societies, in particular with students from partner countries. I will address American students soon. And students from European countries as well. We must spread our Ukrainian ideas and explain at all levels how we, Ukrainians, see life in Europe and the world after this war. A war that changes everything in world politics. I am grateful to the friend of Ukraine, Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte, for today's address to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. This is an important gesture of support. More importantly, the Netherlands is advocating the abandonment of Russian oil and is ready to do so without delay. I signed decrees awarding our defenders. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Kachur Roman Volodymyrovych, Commander of the 55th separate artillery brigade of the Operational Command \"East\" of the Ground Forces. 269 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 14 of them posthumously. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine!Glory to Ukraine! "

  "speech": "Unbreakable people of our most beautiful country! Our defenders! Today we can report on the 200th downed Russian military aircraft. Russia has not lost so many aircraft in any war in decades. And Russia has lost almost 27,000 soldiers, many of them young conscripts. Russia has lost more than three thousand tanks, armored combat vehicles, a large number of conventional military vehicles, helicopters, drones and all its prospects as a state. And why all this? For a monument to Lenin to stand in the temporarily occupied Henichesk for a little longer? There is no other result for Russia and there will not be any. In fact, no one today can predict how long this war will last. But we are doing everything we can to liberate our land quickly. This is our priority - to work every day to make the war shorter. However, this depends, unfortunately, not only on our people, who are already doing the maximum. It also depends on our partners. On European countries, on the countries of the whole free world. I am grateful to all those who are working to strengthen sanctions on Russia and to increase defense and financial support for us, for Ukraine. This is the only recipe for defending freedom in the face of Russia's invasion. And for Western countries, it's not just expenditures. It is not about accounting. It is about the future. The world has already recognized that Russia's blockade of our ports and this war are provoking a large-scale food crisis. Russian officials are also openly threatening the world that there will be famine in dozens of countries. And what could be the consequences of such a famine? What political instability and migration flows will this lead to? How much will you have to spend then to overcome the consequences? These are the questions that need to be answered by those who are delaying sanctions on Russia or trying to postpone aid to Ukraine. Every day of war is an increase in global threats, it is a new opportunity for Russia to provoke instability in other parts of the world, not only here in Europe. And these are new lost lives in Ukraine: Ukrainian men and women who give their lives so that everyone can live freely. I emphasize this: everyone, especially in those countries where they still find time to argue instead of investing in aid as much as possible. Therefore, much more pressure on Russia is needed. And I talk about it openly and daily to everyone on whom it depends. We continue to restore the de-occupied territories of Ukraine. As of today, 1015 settlements have been de-occupied, which is plus six in the past 24 hours. We return electricity, water supply, communications, transport, social services there. It is important. Of course, we remember every city and every community that is still under occupation. Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all cities and towns of Donbas... The gradual liberation of the Kharkiv region proves that we will not leave anyone to the enemy. We do not stop trying to save all our people from Mariupol and Azovstal. Currently, very difficult negotiations are underway on the next stage of the evacuation mission - the rescue of the seriously wounded, medics. It is a large number of people. Of course, we are doing everything to evacuate everyone else, each of our defenders. Everyone in the world who can be the most influential mediator has already been involved in the relevant negotiations. Already 37 foreign missions have resumed their work in Kyiv. And I am grateful to all of them, because this is 37 proofs that Ukraine stands strong and has prospects in contrast to the Russian Federation. I am sure that other foreign missions will return to the capital soon. It is worth returning to work for all Ukrainian businesses that have not yet resumed operations, although they may do so in a safe area. Providing jobs and adjusting economic activity to the existing conditions is also a big contribution to defense, to our future. Traditionally, I signed a decree on awarding our heroes. 212 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. Eternal glory to everyone who defends our state! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Wise people of our bravest country! All our defenders! Last year, on May 14, the Day of Remembrance of Ukrainians who saved Jews during World War II was celebrated in our country for the first time. 2659 Ukrainian men and women received the title of Righteous Among the Nations. Our country is the fourth in the world in the number of the Righteous. People who risked their lives, the lives of their loved ones, but still saved those who were threatened with imminent death at the hands of the Nazis. Rescued children, adults, whole families. Each of these rescue stories is impressive. It strikes with courage, because there was total evil around, and people still kept good in their hearts. It strikes with belief that humanity will still win despite the then occupation and the power of the Nazis. The Righteous were in all regions of our state - from Zakarpattia to Crimea, from Odesa to Kharkiv. And we do not know all the stories of salvation. There were many who simply did not have time to tell thanks to whom their life was saved. They also rescued very young children who simply could not understand what was really happening to them. We must always remember that our people have such Righteous among them and that even in the darkest circumstances there are people who carry light. This is exactly the same striving for good that we see today in Ukrainian men and women who help save people from the occupiers, from the same Nazis. I am grateful to all journalists and just all caring people who document modern stories of salvation and record for all generations of our people what Ukraine has to go through and how people show their best qualities saving others - acquaintances and strangers, relatives, children, adults. I held talks today with a delegation of US senators led by Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitchell McConnell in Kyiv. I believe that this visit once again demonstrates the strength of bipartisan support for our state, the strength of ties between the Ukrainian and American nations. We discussed various areas of support for our state, including defensive and financial. As well as tightening sanctions on Russia. I expressed gratitude for the historic decision to renew the Lend Lease program. I called for the official recognition of Russia as a terrorist state. One of the issues I deal with on a daily basis is food security. More and more countries around the world are realizing that Russia, by blocking the Black Sea for us and continuing this war, puts dozens of other countries at risk of a price crisis in the food market and even famine. This is another incentive for our anti-war coalition to act more decisively together. Now support for Ukraine - and especially with weapons - means working to prevent global famine. The sooner we liberate our land and guarantee Ukraine's security, the sooner the normal state of the food market can be restored. The situation in Donbas remains very difficult. Russian troops are still trying to show at least some victory. On the 80th day of the full-scale invasion, it looks especially insane, but they do not stop all these efforts. I am grateful to everyone who holds the line and brings closer to Donbas, Pryazovia and Kherson the same thing that is happening now in the Kharkiv region. Step by step we are forcing the occupiers to leave our land. We will make them leave the Ukrainian sea as well. By the way, now in many cities and communities of Ukraine there are discussions about renaming streets and squares. My advice is to turn to the stories of the Ukrainian Righteous and perpetuate their memory. Because it is about the courage and humanity of Ukrainians who have already proved that the evil that comes to our land will inevitably lose. Eternal glory to all our defenders! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! The 81st day of our defense is coming to an end and another week of round-the-clock work for Ukraine and victory is beginning. This week, as always, there will be a lot of international activity in which I will take part. The key is weapons and financial support for Ukraine. Finances not only to maintain stability now, but also to begin rebuilding what Russia has ruined. We are also working to strengthen sanctions on Russia. Partners need to make decisions that limit Russia's ties to the world every week. The occupiers must feel the rising cost of war for them, feel it constantly. Now the priority is the oil embargo. No matter how hard Moscow tries to disrupt this decision, the time of Europe's dependence on Russian energy resources is coming to an end. And that can’t be changed. Another task, which becomes even more important the longer the war lasts, is to do everything to maintain the world's maximum attention to us, to Ukraine. Information about our needs should be in the news of all countries that are important to us constantly and every day. In particular, for this purpose - for greater information and political support of Ukraine - on Monday I will communicate with students of leading American universities. These are 63 US universities and two Canadian universities, which unite hundreds of thousands of students and are a large expert and research community. Their voice will definitely strengthen our capabilities. A separate address to Stanford University students is also planned for the end of May. I am also preparing to communicate with Ukrainian students from the leading universities of our country. In my address to them I will answer some important difficult questions that already exist in our society, which are already visible. And I expect profound questions from them, from our students. I will definitely continue to address the parliaments of Ukraine's European partner states. Our task is the status of a candidate for EU membership for Ukraine, and later - accession to the European Union under the fast-track procedure. Every state matters. Every vote counts. It is equally important to have the maximum consent of European countries in the issue of strengthening sanctions on Russia. That is why I will be addressing the Luxembourg Parliament in the near future. By the way, we are also working to expand the geography of such special speeches in the parliaments of Africa and Asia. An address to the participants of the Davos Forum is scheduled for May 23. This year the conference will be especially important for our country. Post-war reconstruction will be discussed. We are doing our best to fully gather the support of the world, and participation in the Davos Forum is one of the best opportunities for that. We continue very complicated and delicate negotiations to save our people from Mariupol, from Azovstal. We deal with this issue on a daily basis. And the main thing is for the agreements to be fulfilled. We expect the United States to adopt important decisions for our country. A new significant package of support and detailed elaboration of the renewed historical program of the Lend-Lease. We are preparing for new attempts by Russia to attack in Donbas, to somehow intensify its movement in the south of Ukraine. The occupiers still do not want to admit that they are in a dead end and their so-called \"special operation\" has already gone bankrupt. But the moment will surely come when the Ukrainian people will force the invaders to fully recognize reality. No matter how \"creative\" they are in Kherson and Melitopol, no matter how they portray their alleged \"power\" in the occupied areas of Pryazovia and Donbas, they are there temporarily. The Ukrainian flag, Ukrainian law, Ukrainian life will still be there anyway. Today's Russian missile strikes at the Lviv region, shelling of Hulyaipole, Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, cities and communities of the Donetsk region - all this brutality of the occupiers, which Ukraine is experiencing every day, will only lead to the fact that Russian surviving soldiers will bring this evil back to Russia. They will bring it back because they will retreat. This is how all the feverish activity of the Russian military we see now will end. And I am grateful to all the Ukrainians who are bringing this time closer. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear friends! I am grateful for this opportunity, I am grateful for the honor to address the students today, to answer your questions. Not all of you, however, look like students. You are already rectors, already heads of educational institutions, presidents. But as far as I understand, the student community hears us and it is very important that it sees us. This is really important. Because my speech is dedicated to them and then I will be ready for a dialogue. To them exactly, because the speech is about choice. This is the age when you have to make a choice. The main choice that everyone makes in one way or another in his life. Makes at this, I would say, golden age, student age. Or even earlier. When choosing the answer to the question of who he is. Who are you? What are you like? I will give you my example so that you can feel what I am talking about and what I wanted to tell you. Who am I? I am the President of Ukraine. I studied law. Then practiced in court. Then I became an artist, producer, businessman. And then I became a President - the President of our beautiful state. And each of these stages was supposedly a different life. But in fact, it's one life. This is the answer to the question of who you are in life. Are you a subject or are you just watching? Are you trying to change something or not? Are you worried - and that's all, or are you worried and trying to help, fix, do something? It is a choice that determines life. What you will be. What your country will be like. Each of you, students, even if you don't realize it, makes that choice. Every day. And then it becomes your character, it becomes your destiny. For example, each and every one of you in life has probably been in a situation where there is hatred next to you. When a person insults another person in word or deed. When another person is humiliated. When someone is trying to take something from another person. Are there many who will help in this situation? There are those who just watch. Someone will shoot a video with a smartphone, it is very popular now, and then post it on Instagram or YouTube. Someone may just laugh. And someone will still help. Stop the humiliation. Stop the hatred. Help a person feel dignity again. There are many situations when the word can mean salvation for a person. Who feels that life is not going in the right direction. Or when a mistake is made. Seemingly a terrible and fatal mistake. After which you may not want to live at all. We have all seen such situations in the movies. When a person may attempt suicide. And some have seen it in real life. And some have faced a choice - whether to try to help or not? Or just to walk by? Whether to shoot a video of what you see and then collect likes and shares on your social network? It is good that there are people who do not stay away. Those who take the situation into their own hands and help. I remember a terrible day for your nation and for the whole democratic world - 9\/11. I then watched the attack on the \"twins\" on TV - with my friends. And some of them just couldn't believe what was happening. Some even said that this could only happen in America. And he was told very quickly that it could happen in any country, it could happen to anyone. Because terror knows no borders. I remembered how shortly before September 11 I was in New York, I was there - in the \"twins\". And I felt that it could happen when I was there. That I could be among thousands of people - either in the towers or next to them. And I would be faced with the same choice - how to escape? How to save others? Who to help? And could I be able to help myself? When one day you decide for yourself that you have to be the master of your life, then you always stay with that power and look for what to do. After the full-scale invasion of Russia, I heard a lot of advice. All of them came down to the fact that we have to accept that Ukraine has become a victim. Victim of the occupation of Russia. That there is almost no chance for resistance. That the Russian army will allegedly take down all our resistance very quickly - three or five days. And that it is supposedly better for me to just leave Ukraine, because no one will be able to stop Russia. I was offered help with transport instead of help with weapons! But it was just not about us. These were completely wrong proposals. They did not take into account who we are. Who I am. How we see life here in Ukraine. Our country will never be a victim again. It will not just be an observer of life - including its own life. We can, want to and will be subjects in life. We made this choice. This is my choice. And the choice of the vast majority of Ukrainian citizens. This is where our strength comes from, our strong desire for the freedom we are fighting for. And I am grateful to those who made that choice with us. Who also decided to be the subject of life and the struggle for principles, and they are the same for us - the struggle for freedom. There is case law in your country. If once - even a long time ago - a decision was made at the appropriate level by a proper court, similar cases are decided according to this precedent. This is always taken into account. The same is true, in fact, in international politics. What is Russia doing now? It is trying to set a precedent. If it manages to break the statehood of the neighboring nation, other states will do the same. What is Ukraine doing now with its partners? Trying to set another precedent. So that all the aggressors in the world once and for all see that the war will create the biggest problems for them - for the aggressors. So that they know that the hatred they spread against ordinary people like you and me, against other nations, will strike first and foremost at themselves when the free world refuses to deal with those who spread such hatred. This is a very transparent process of struggle. And everyone chooses a role in it. There are states that are trying to stay away. Be supposedly neutral. And not help fight for our common values. It's the same as in life, when help is needed, and there is only a crowd of people watching instead of helping. And there are states that contribute as much as possible to protect freedom. To stop the aggression. To guarantee the force of international law. It is this role that the United States has chosen, and I am very grateful to your people, to your leaders for that choice. After all, it is also the answer to who you want to be in life. Those who do not want to be just a victim or an indifferent observer. But those who can and do defend democracy, because that is how they protect themselves as well. Their freedom, their way of life, their people. Their worldview in which there should be no room for individual violence or brutal wars. Each of you right now - at this age and in the position you are in - chooses this for yourself. How do you respond to challenges? What do you do when you see injustice? And I really want you to choose this path for yourself. The path of clear awareness of who you are. The path of agency. Because if it is your choice, it will always be the choice of your country. Just as it is the choice of our country. Thank you very much! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 82nd day of our defense is coming to an end. A difficult day. But this day, like all others, is aimed precisely at saving our country and our people. Regarding the situation in Mariupol. Thanks to the actions of the Ukrainian military - the Armed Forces of Ukraine, intelligence, the negotiating team, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations, we hope that we will be able to save the lives of our guys. Among them are the seriously wounded, they are being provided with medical aid. I want to emphasize: Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive. This is our principle. I think that every adequate person will understand these words. The operation to rescue the defenders of Mariupol was started by our military and intelligence officers. To bring the boys home, the work continues, and this work needs delicacy. And time. We also maintain maximum diplomatic activity in other areas in the interests of Ukraine. I spoke today with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. On how to speed up the provision of financial assistance to Ukraine, given the state budget deficit during the war, which is about $ 5 billion a month. We also talked about the main directions of further cooperation. On the eve of the meeting of the G7 finance ministers, these talks with the IMF Managing Director are a direct preparation for very important decisions for Ukraine. A high-ranking Polish delegation worked in Kyiv. Consultations with them were held regarding cooperation at the European Union level. In particular, it concerns the acceleration of our integration into the European Union and the expected decision on the candidate status for Ukraine. We are also working to ensure that the European Union agrees on a sixth package of sanctions on Russia. The oil embargo must be a part of it, and it is in the interests not only of our state, but also of the whole of Europe. I am grateful to those leaders of the continent who are aware of this and help promote the respective decision. I addressed the student community of the United States of America - representatives of leading universities. I also talked to the rectors and presidents of these educational institutions. The key issue is to involve American universities in rebuilding our education system after the war. In addition, we discussed political issues, including the protection of democracy, countering Russian propaganda and fakes. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are repelling constant attacks in those areas where Russia is still trying to advance. Severodonetsk and other cities in Donbas remain the main targets for the occupiers. We do everything to protect our land and our people. I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 201 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Senior Lieutenant Ahasyiev Kyrylo Yashar oğlu - platoon commander of the 92nd separate mechanized brigade. And posthumously to Lieutenant Colonel Yerk Vyacheslav Volodymyrovych, commander of the aviation squadron of the 40th tactical aviation brigade. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "It is a great honor for me to address you. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends! I will tell you a story. Indeed, a lot of stories begin with the words \"I will tell you a story\". But in this one, the finale will be much more important than the beginning. And this will not be an open ending. Finally, it can put an end to a battle that has lasted more than a hundred years. This battle began with the arrival of the train. The hero and the antagonist came out of it. And so the confrontation on the screen was born, which turned into real life. First, cinematography appeared in our life, then it became our life. And then, what the future would be like depended on cinematography as well. My story today is about this battle. About the battle. And about the future. The worst dictators of the 20th century loved cinematography. It is known about them. But the most important thing left after them is the eerie documentary footage of the newsreel. As well as movies that challenged these dictators. The first festival was to begin on September 1, 1939 in Cannes. But World War II broke out. For six years, cinematography has been on the frontlines of this war, along with all mankind. For six years, cinematography has been fighting for freedom, and also, unfortunately, for the benefit of the dictatorship. Now, going back to that movie, we can see how freedom was moving towards victory. And in the end, it did not allow dictators to capture people's hearts. There were many important points along the way. However, the most outstanding was in 1940. When, in contrast to the antagonist, the world saw, at first glance, an inconspicuous guy who did not look like a hero at all. But he turned out to be so. \"The Great Dictator\" by Charlie Chaplin did not destroy the real dictator then. But thanks to it, cinematography ceased to be dumb. Dumb in every sense of the word. Cinematography spoke, and it was the voice of the future victory of freedom. Even then, in 1940. When the screens sounded: “The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish…” Since then - since those words of the hero played by Chaplin - mankind has produced many beautiful movies. It seemed that everyone already understood that one can conquer people with the beautiful, gathering them near the screens, and not with the ugly, gathering them in bomb shelters. It seemed that everyone already believed that the horror in the form of a full-scale war that could cover the entire continent would not have continuation. But again, as then, there is a dictator. Again, as then, there is a war for freedom. Again, as then, it is necessary for cinematography not to be dumb. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale war against Ukraine. Planning to go further to Europe. And what kind of war is this? I want to answer this question as clearly as possible. Armed with the words that were said by cinematography in the years after the previous continental war. You have already heard most of these words. They sound eerie. On the screen. But, unfortunately, this has become a reality. Remember that? Remember how it sounded in the movies? “You smell that? Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning…” Yes, it started in Ukraine in the morning. At four o'clock, when we heard the first missile explosions. When the air strikes began. And when death, going to Ukraine across the border, marked its equipment with the swastika analogue - the \"Z\" symbol. \"They all want to be better Nazis than Hitler...\" Now, there is not a single week passing without mass graves of killed and tortured people found in the territory where Russian troops were or still are. 229 children were killed as a result of the Russian invasion. “They can't get anywhere but kill, kill, kill! They have sown Europe with corpses…” You saw what the Russian military did in the small town of Bucha. You saw Mariupol. Saw Azovstal. Saw the theater blown up by a Russian bomb. By the way, it was similar to where you are now. Ordinary civilians were hiding there from the shelling. Two large and noticeable inscriptions \"Children\". They were on the asphalt near the theater. And we will never forget it, because it is not even Hell. “War isn't Hell. War is war, and Hell is Hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse…” More than 2,000 Russian missiles have already hit Ukraine. Dozens of cities were completely destroyed. Scorched villages. More than 500,000 Ukrainians have been deported to Russia by force. Tens of thousands are in Russian camps created on the model of Nazi camps. No one knows how many prisoners will survive there. But everyone knows who is to blame. “You think soap can wash you?” Unlikely. The worst war since World War II is already in Europe. First of all, because of one person who is in Moscow. Other people die every day. And they will not come to life after the phrase \"Stop, cut!\". But what do we hear about it now? Will the movie be silent or will it speak? If there is a dictator, if there is a war for freedom and if again, as then, everything depends on our unity, will cinematography remain outside this unity? Our cities are not destroyed by virtual graphics. Many Ukrainians have become Guido and are trying to explain to children why they have to hide in the basement. Many Ukrainians have become like Aldo Raine. The land of our country is already streaked with thousands of trenches. Of course, we will continue to fight. And we have no alternative but to fight for freedom. And I am sure that the dictator will lose. But words should sound like in 1940. Sound from all screens of the free world. We need a new Chaplin, who will prove again that cinematography is no longer dumb. Remember how it sounded then: “Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness… To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair… The hate of men will pass, and dictators die.” We must finally win this battle. And we need cinematography that will provide just such a finale. So that every voice is on the side of freedom. And, as it has always been seen, first of all the voice of cinematography. I thank you all! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 83rd day of our defense began with a rather powerful combination of Russian strikes at Ukraine. Missile shelling of the Lviv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region. Air strikes in the Luhansk region. Specific sabotage activity in the border areas of Ukraine. All this is not just creating tension for our state, not just testing our strength. This is a kind of attempt of the Russian army to compensate for a series of failures in the east and south of our country. They cannot demonstrate success with general military action in the areas where they are trying to advance. So they are trying to show success through their missiles and other activities. To no avail as well. These strikes, like many previous ones, do not change anything radically. Especially since our air defense and anti-sabotage measures are becoming stronger. I had a conversation today with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Quite productive. First of all, about the defense support for Ukraine, about our cooperation at the EU level. I informed him about the current situation on the battlefield and the possible development of this situation. I had a conversation with President of France Emmanuel Macron. Substantive and long. We discussed the sixth package of sanctions being prepared in the European Union. We also discussed the negotiation process with Russia and evacuation of our heroes from Azovstal. The evacuation mission continues, it is overseen by our military and intelligence. The most influential international mediators are involved. We also spoke separately and substantively with the President of France about our European integration steps and the consideration of Ukraine's application for EU candidate status. I continue to gather the largest possible international audience for Ukraine. To support our state at all levels. And to put pressure on Russia at all levels. Information, diplomatic and cultural pressure is what we need. So that, as in the days of World War II, the struggle for freedom can rely in particular on the power of art. So today, during the opening ceremony of the Cannes Film Festival, I addressed the world filmmaking community. I reminded that now, as in the 1940s, it is necessary to boldly and openly defend freedom and fight the dictatorship. Right now is the time. When the language of cinematography can and should become the language of the struggle for freedom. Today I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 165 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 13 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to 3 servicemen of the 24th separate mechanized brigade. To those who showed extraordinary courage and efficiency in the battles in Donbas. Today I bid farewell to the first President of Ukraine Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk. The ceremony took place in Kyiv. In Kyiv, which will remain Ukrainian. The capital of an independent state. From 1991 and forever. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who fought for independence! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear citizens! All our great people! On this day last year, I said we would be back. Return to Crimea. Every year on May 18, Ukraine commemorates the victims of the genocide of the Crimean Tatar people. The people whom they wanted to deprive of their homeland. The people whom they wanted to deprive of their lives. The people whose history and whose name they wanted to erase. But the people who managed to return home. Managed to preserve themselves and the truth. On May 18, 1944, the Soviet authorities began the forced deportation of the indigenous people of Crimea, the Crimean Tatars, from their only homeland. After the terrible war that took place in Crimea, as well as throughout Ukraine, as well as throughout Europe, the whole people was then put on the brink of survival. During and after the deportation, when the Crimean Tatar people were forced to live abroad, almost half of the IDPs died. Almost half the people! It was a deliberate crime of tyranny against the people and against humanity as such. Today we turn again to what was experienced then. And we are doing this in conditions when the descendants of that tyranny are not only trying to deprive Crimean Tatars of their home for the second time - since 2014. They also want to take away the home of the entire multi-million Ukrainian people - all who live on our land. Significant territories are under the occupation of the Russian army. There are so-called filtration camps, through which hundreds of thousands of people pass. The occupiers are destroying our cities, our villages. They forced more than 12 million Ukrainian men and women to leave their home. And again, like 78 years ago, they are forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of our people abroad to remote areas. Last year, on May 18, addressing the people, I recalled the lines of the Crimean Tatar poetess Lilya Budzhurova \"When we return\": When all our people return home \/ You will have to remember where we were born \/ You will have to remember where you yourself were born \/ Showed up as uninvited guests here. And this year, in the days of this war, we prove: Ukraine is really coming back. The truth is coming back. And people are coming back. A full-scale invasion of Russia, inspired by the worst the world has seen in the 1940s, raises from ashes the experience of that time. However, it encourages us to return these occupiers to what all anti-human regimes ultimately go through, namely, their defeat. The territory of the northern regions of our state has already been liberated. We are returning the Kharkiv region. Defenders of our state are repelling the most desperate efforts of the occupiers in Donbas. The Armed Forces of Ukraine simultaneously repel the attacks of Russian troops in the south. We defend Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, Odesa. And we remember every city and every community that is still under occupation. I always emphasize: under temporary occupation. And, of course, we remember Crimea. The occupying forces have already suffered such defeats in Ukraine that Russia has not seen in various wars for decades. Poisoned by state propaganda, many Russians are simply unaware of this yet. They do not want to see how big their losses are - in different senses of the word. People, economy, culture, future. But life will make them feel these losses. In 1944, expelling the Crimean Tatars from their land, the then torturers were convinced that none of the displaced would return home, to Crimea. Now, trying to occupy Ukraine and destroy our lives, the current torturers of the people were also convinced that everything would work out for them and that we would not be able to endure it. And we endured. And we are struggling to bring life back to every corner of our home. And we are coming back. Today, on this very day, I am signing the law \"On Social and Legal Protection of Persons Deprived of Personal Freedom as a Result of Armed Aggression against Ukraine and Members of Their Families\" adopted by the Verkhovna Rada. This law is to protect all those ordinary peaceful, civilian people who have been repressed by the occupiers and who have been taken prisoner by them. This law is, in particular, for Nariman Dzhelyalov and many others who are deprived of their liberty by strangers in Crimea, in their native home. For those who are being held in prisons on the peninsula and who have been deported to Russia. This law is for the relatives and friends of all prisoners of the Kremlin - in Donetsk, Luhansk, in all those areas, and in Crimea. For all who have been tormented by the enemy. This is help and protection. And we will definitely restore justice. Qırım serbest olacaq! Eternal memory to all victims of the genocide of the Crimean Tatar people!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today, one of the representatives of the Russian state said that the occupiers allegedly began to use laser weapons systems in Ukraine. Allegedly to save missiles. Firstly, it is noteworthy that they need to save missiles and somehow explain it. That is, more than two thousand missiles fired by the Russian army at Ukraine were the main part of their stockpile of missiles. That is, only the remnants are left. Secondly, everyone has already seen Russia at war. Inexperienced conscripts, which it throws into battle like cannon fodder. Marauders who see normal appliances for the first time in a foreign country. Old Soviet \"armor\" without modern protection. Forbidden phosphorous bombs, which they use to burn schools and ordinary houses. And missiles, most of which were spent by the Russian army on the destruction of absolutely civilian infrastructure without any strategic military outcome. Today they hit missiles in such a way at Mykolaiv and Dnipro. Well, in the propaganda of Nazi Germany there was such a term \"wunderwaffe\". Wonder weapon. The clearer it became they had no chance in the war, the more propaganda there was about the wonder weapon, which would be so powerful that it would provide a turning point in the war. And here we see that in the third month of a full-scale war, Russia is trying to find its \"wunderwaffe\". Allegedly laser. All this clearly indicates the complete failure of the invasion. But again, this also shows that they are afraid to admit that catastrophic mistakes have been made at the highest state and military levels in Russia. Therefore, they will come up with more and more \"wunderwaffe\" as the Armed Forces of Ukraine and all our defenders liberate our land step by step. How long will it take? The answer to this question can only be given by the real situation on the battlefield. We are trying to do it as soon as possible. That's for sure. We are obliged to drive out the occupiers and guarantee Ukraine real security. That is why I signed decrees on the extension of the legal regime of martial law and the term of general mobilization. I hope that the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine will support this decision in the near future. Our army and all those who defend the state must have all the legal tools to act steadily. Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all of our cities and communities that are under occupation - under temporary occupation - should know that Ukraine will return. I said today in my address on the occasion of the Day of Remembrance of the Victims of the Deportation of the Crimean Tatar People that our state does not leave anyone behind and returns what belongs to Ukraine by right. We remember Crimea. And we will never forget 1944 - the genocide of Crimean Tatars committed by the Soviet authorities. And 2014 - the second wave of destruction of everything free on the Crimean peninsula. Especially on this day I signed the law on the protection of persons deprived of liberty by the occupiers, as well as on the protection of family members of such people. We are talking about all the Kremlin prisoners - both in Crimea and in the occupied part of Donbas. The law gives them more protection and assistance from the state. We are also accumulating all possible resources of the world to support Ukraine. I am grateful to Andriy Shevchenko, our legendary football player, for becoming the first ambassador of the new national brand of Ukraine - United24. The state needs this platform right now, which allows, in particular, to raise funds to support Ukraine. Anyone in the world - in one click - can contribute to our victory. And in the direction he or she considers most important. For example, defense and demining, medical care or rebuilding the country. And in early June we will be able to see the first special event in London with the participation of Andriy Shevchenko in support of United24. I thanked President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for the package of aid to our country announced today. Its amount is 9 billion euros. And also for supporting the plans for restoration of Ukraine. This step by the European Commission is a testament to the true leadership that the European Union is capable of. And it will definitely help us in the struggle for our common freedom. I spoke with the new President of the United Arab Emirates. Congratulated him on his election and invited to take part in the post-war reconstruction of the state. We discussed the threat to global food security that Russia had provoked by the invasion. And traditionally in the evening I signed the decree on awarding our heroes. 197 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 5 of them - posthumously. Also today I had the honor to present the Order of the Golden Star to servicemen who were previously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. In particular, to Colonel Serhiy Baranovsky for courage and efficiency in the battles in Donbas. And to Colonel Serhiy Musienko for personal courage and success in the battles in the Kharkiv region. Eternal glory to the defenders of Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for our independence and freedom. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I am really glad to have the opportunity to talk to you today and I hope that this will be exactly communication. Not a lecture or seminar, which I'm sure you already have enough. I would like to build a dialogue with you, so in my speech I will ask questions, and I am interested to hear each and everyone who would like to answer.  So when you ask your questions, please choose one or several of my questions and give your answer. Let's start. This is a very special time for our country. Millions of our people are now fighting for the right to life and freedom for our people. And it really opens up a space of possibilities. Right now it is our country that is in a situation where we can choose the future for it as we decide. That is, it is not just an adaptation to the conditions created for Ukraine by other generations or even other states. As it is for other countries, and as it was for our state before the war. We can consciously reshape our lives. Here is what is possible now. These are great opportunities, this is the time to determine which Ukraine you want to live in. So my first question to you today is about this: what should our state be like? And this question logically continues with a number of related questions. Do you want to live in Ukraine? Do you expect changes from Ukraine to live here? Or, on the contrary, you believe that our country already has everything for you to live here. Let's move on. There are many countries in the world that are talking about reforms. Even the most developed ones always have it. The words \"the system is not working and needs to be fixed.\" This is a common narrative for many politicians. But in few countries, as in ours now, there are opportunities not just to \"fix\" the existing system, but to create a new one. Based on what is best. Not only here, now. But also in those countries where it would be worth taking the best. Of course, this war put an end to many things from the life of Ukraine before. But not to all. For example, our people who have gone abroad while the hostilities are going on say that certain things in our lives are much more progressive than in other countries. Digitization, which we started doing in the public sphere. Internet and communication, which are very accessible due to business. The service sector, in which speed and willingness to work is often greater than in many European countries. It turned out so. We must also not forget that even during a full-scale war, our institutions did not break down. Banking sphere works. The budget system and public administration have endured. Defense and logistics are ensured despite the fact that the enemy in some respects has more forces and equipment. That is, society has a certain foundation, and it would be unwise not to use it. But we must understand that Russia will always be there. And it may always be a threat. After February 24, we have already achieved a lot. And now, for example, you can see how the world evaluates our potential in a fundamentally different way. Perhaps you have seen how two Forbes articles are compared, very interestingly: the headline of February 12 - will Russia invade Ukraine; and the headline of May 16 - will Ukraine’s army invade Russia. That is, the world began to look differently at the situation in our region and the balance of power. But it is important what we think about ourselves. What our people feel about our state. So, my next question to you: what should Ukraine be like so that you can be sure that we can protect ourselves from any threat? This question also continues with a number of others. For example, a professional contract army or with the addition of a certain form of conscription? How big should the army be? What share of public expenditures should we spend on defense? The biggest or not? And even in the conditions of the future peace? Should private military companies be allowed? Should there be a universal military obligation in Ukraine for all boys and girls, as is the case, for example, in Israel, so that all our people can defend themselves when needed? And should all citizens or a significant part, as is the case in other states, be involved in military training every year? Suppose, while maintaining the salary and job at the time of the training. Are you ready to personally defend Ukraine with weapons in hands? Or do you think it is fair that someone else will fight on the battlefield? These questions of mine are not rhetorical. We really need answers. And it's not just something purely functional. About state governance or politics. It's about how our people can understand each other and how to stay in Ukraine, because this is our home. Your home. How not to quarrel in it and live developing common interests. For example, people often remain in the rear, but demand from those on the frontline to drive the occupiers all the way to Kuban. It is often the case that a person in the military sphere does not go beyond photographs in camouflage, but at the same time behaves as if he can lead the troops better than anyone else. What is your attitude to such people, for example, in politics? Or in the media? Anyone, it doesn't matter. And how should their personal emotions and ambitions relate to reality, to real war? Does a non-combatant have the right to demand something from warriors? Demand meeting some of your requirements and expectations? Is that fair? You probably see that this war can end for Ukraine with certain security guarantees. And in this regard, I have the following question for you: Which countries do you see among the possible guarantors of security for Ukraine? Should we choose those we trust? Or should we focus on everyone who is strong enough? Security guarantees for Ukraine are a really good opportunity to create a tool for decades that will allow us to live in peace. Although it will not allow us to be careless about security. All the same, we will always think about defense. And we must understand that there is no better security than the willingness of citizens to defend their own state. Because it is the protection of oneself first of all - one's family, one's home, one's land, one's way of life. This is the state - all this. So, if any of you are not personally ready to defend the state - well, tell me why? Perhaps you see your other contribution to the common national security, which is really special? Maybe it's something in the field of cybersecurity. You may want to join some form of volunteering. Perhaps, as future businessmen or scientists - you see for yourself some other option, the third, fourth, fifth. So, my next question to you: Should the state regulate at its discretion who to involve in defense and how, or leave people the choice during the war? Of course, I have my answers to these questions. But Ukraine differs from Russia and other tyrannies with the fact that not one person decides everything for the whole nation, but people can choose the rules of life for themselves. So, the next block of questions. Given that Russia will remain our neighbor, we need to consider the format of security inside Ukraine. The key question is about weapons. Is there a need for the order of possession of firearms by ordinary people that, say, we see in the United States? Or, as in Switzerland, in a society of \"citizens with weapons\" who can quickly join the defense of their country, and where, for example, a former soldier can keep at home the weapons with which he served. What should be the weapons system? Should it be allowed to carry it openly? Should it be limited to the right to own and keep it at home? Should the rules be the same for all regions of the country or should more liberal ones be provided for those regions where there is a greater threat of invasion? Do you know how to use weapons? How should the border with Russia work after this war? Should it be completely closed or open? In other words, how do you see coexistence with the Russian Federation and its citizens after the war? Could there be what they call the word \"relationship\" between us and them? Or should it be deliberately restricted, even if it occurs at some level? Let's move on. It’s been a long time since I was a student and that's understandable. And I think more about which universities my children will study at. Which Ukrainian universities. This is very important. Maybe my daughter, who will soon be 18, will be in an auditorium one of you is currently studying in. But I remember well when I was a student. And I remember that many people of my generation felt a certain loss of time. Years in auditoria, years of lectures... It seemed to many and, I'm sure, now someone thinks for sure that 5 or 6 years at university is a long time. Probably, if it is a medical specialty, it takes 7 years and a lifetime to study, taking into account all the nuances. But if it is some other specialty, does it always take 5 years? Perhaps 2, 3, 4 are enough for some, given how the modern economy works and how quickly technology is transformed. What do you think about it? And what economic life are you preparing for? Do you anticipate that you will have to change professions during your life? Several times. Or what professions, in your opinion, will always exist and will not be replaced by artificial intelligence and robotics? Maybe it is worth increasing the share of private business in the education system? What do you think about private universities, what do you think about private schools, private education? Can your university's curriculum compete with the curricula and courses currently offered in a variety of formats outside of universities? Don't you feel like you're wasting your time? Because now in the world, even more than before, the main thing is speed. There is such a feeling. Speed in the ability to learn. In everything. At work, in the constant transformation that life demands of the individual. Modern life. I must have been talking for a long time already. Then the last question. Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine has been going on for three months already. After 8 years of war in Donbas. This war for us now is undoubtedly a war for independence. We can say that this is a postponed war. Postponed for 30 years, given how we gained independence in 1991. Or for hundreds of years, given the previous history of our great state. I have no doubt that we will gain independence. And it will be in our history the same as in other countries that fought for independence and won. Countries that ceased to be beggars and became subjects. The real masters of their lives and their future. But we must remember now and always that the price of all this is tens of thousands of lives. The lives of all those killed by the enemy. Tens of thousands. For independence. And for the opportunity for each of you to choose how to live and which Ukraine to live in. So, my question to you: Is it worth it? I really hope to hear the answer to this question."

  "speech": "Unbreakable people of the bravest country! All our defenders! Today, the 85th day of our defense, will be remembered for sure. I am grateful to the United States for approving a new $ 40 billion package of support for Ukraine and democracy in our region. Today, this package was passed by the US Senate. It is a manifestation of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom. A meeting of finance ministers, heads of G7 central banks and representatives of international donors also took place in Germany. I always say frankly: the monthly budget deficit in Ukraine now is $ 5 billion. And to endure the war for freedom, we need quick and sufficient financial support. And it's not just expenditures or a gift from partners. This is their contribution to their own security. Because the defense of Ukraine also means their defense from new wars and crises that Russia may provoke. If it succeeds in the war against Ukraine. That is why we must all work together to ensure that there is no success for Russia in its aggression against our state. Neither military, nor economic, nor any other. I spoke today with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. I personally thanked her for the macro-financial assistance in the amount of 9 billion euros, this package was proposed the day before. I also spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On economic issues, in particular on the export of our agricultural products and fuel imports. And also about the situation in the areas of hostilities and the evacuation of our heroes from Azovstal. I am doing my best to keep the most influential international forces informed and, as much as possible, involved in rescuing our military. I addressed students of Ukrainian universities. And it was a special address. I hope it will be heard not only by students. Because now is the time when we have the opportunity to build the future for Ukraine that we really want. Our future, Ukrainian future. Without any obsolete and toxic things that have nothing to do with our national needs and our character. Ukraine has become the master of its own life and must decide for itself how to live. In total, students of 25 Ukrainian universities took part in today's meeting. Geography is quite wide: Kyiv, Bila Tserkva, Mariupol, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lviv, Kryvyi Rih, Donetsk, Kherson, Ivano-Frankivsk, Horlivka, Dnipro. Not all universities operate in their cities. Some of them moved. But what was nice and right - students and rectors are confident that Ukraine will win and restore free life throughout the territory. Important current issues were also discussed. Firstly, I instructed the Minister of Education to prepare changes that will allow applicants from all temporarily occupied territories to enter Ukrainian universities under a simplified procedure. Secondly, I instructed the Minister to decide how to ensure the education of those students who study under contract, but come from the currently occupied territories. Obviously, it is extremely difficult to pay for a contract to study in such conditions. The state must help. Therefore, I expect relevant decisions from the Minister, the Government and, if necessary, the people's deputies. We talked with students about post-war reconstruction and how to guarantee the security of our state for decades to come. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue the liberation of the Kharkiv region. But in Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure. There's hell, and that's not an exaggeration. The brutal and absolutely pointless bombing of Severodonetsk... 12 dead and dozens wounded in just one day. The bombing and shelling of other cities, the air and missile strikes of the Russian army - all this is not just hostilities during the war. Russian strikes at the Chernihiv region, in particular the terrible strike at Desna, debris clearance continues, many dead; constant strikes at the Odesa region, at the cities of central Ukraine, Donbas is completely destroyed - all this doesn’t and cannot have any military explanation for Russia. This is a deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible. Destroy as many houses, social facilities and enterprises as possible. This is what will be qualified as the genocide of the Ukrainian people and for which the occupiers will definitely be brought to justice. The first trial in Ukraine against a Russian war criminal has already begun. And it will end with the full restoration of justice within the international tribunal. I'm sure of it. We will find and bring to justice all those who give and carry out criminal orders. Today I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 210 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 48 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was posthumously awarded to Captain Serhiy Parkhomenko, commander of the aviation unit of the 299th tactical aviation brigade. Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to everyone who is fighting for independence! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! But also our partners in the world. Today my appeal is broader than usual. And this address is dedicated to the subject on which we will work together in the near future. Namely, compensation for all the losses that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine through its aggression. Please take a look at how this day has passed. Missile strike of the Russian army at the Kharkiv region. In the town of Lozova, the occupiers destroyed a house of culture. Of course, Russia has already done everything possible to ensure that there is no place left for culture on its territory. But what does our Kharkiv region have to do with it? Let them undermine what is left of their houses of culture in Russia, if they want to. The invaders also hit the Odesa region, Poltava region, Zhytomyr region. Attempts to attack Donbas continue. They completely ruined Rubizhne, Volnovakha, just as Mariupol. They are trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities. They do everything to erode any normal life in the Kherson region, in those areas of the Zaporizhzhia region where they entered. All this and much more that the Russian army has done since February 24 and since 2014 needs a fair response. First of all, liberation. We must fight until we clear our land of the occupiers and guarantee Ukraine's security. Secondly, it is the prosecution of all Russian war criminals. In the Ukrainian courts, in the international tribunal and just on the battlefield while the war continues. But, thirdly, we are working to ensure that Russia compensates in one way or another for everything it has destroyed in Ukraine. Every burned house. Every ruined school, ruined hospital. Each blown up house of culture and infrastructure facility. Every destroyed enterprise. Every shut down business, every hryvnia lost by people, enterprises, communities and the state. Russian money as compensation should reach every affected person, family, business. Of course, the Russian state will not even recognize that it is an aggressor. But its recognition is not required. We urge our partner countries to legally recognize that Russia must be held financially responsible for the crimes it committed. This is important not only in the context of this war waged by Russia. But also in the context of any other aggressive actions, whether by Russia or any other potential aggressor. Evil must get a retribution and know that it will be punished. Therefore, we invite the partner countries to sign a multilateral agreement and create a mechanism through which each and every one who has suffered from Russia's actions will be able to receive compensation for all losses. Under such an agreement, Russian funds and property under the jurisdiction of partner countries must be seized or frozen, and then confiscated and directed to a specially created fund from which all victims of Russian aggression can receive appropriate compensation. That would be fair. And Russia will feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every projectile it has fired at us. We invite our partners to become the founders of such a fund, as well as members of a special international commission that will consider lawsuits, i.e. appeals from both individuals and legal entities. It is clear that this task will not be easy. But in fact, the debate has begun about the need for such compensation at the cost of Russian assets. The world is already talking about it. So we have to do it. And we are starting such a special dialogue with our partners. To make the aggressor feel that the war is capable of inflicting maximum damage not on anyone else, but on the one who went with it to a neighbor. The world has seen that existing international organizations and instruments cannot cope with all the challenges. Therefore, it is necessary not only to use the opportunities that already exist, but also to offer new ones. It will be effective. I also spoke today about Russia's responsibility for this war with representatives of Ireland who visited Ukraine. The Chairpersons of both Houses of the Irish Parliament were in the capital. We had very meaningful talks with them. And one more thing. Today I definitely want to thank our people who do not stop fighting the occupation. And especially those who are now in the territory that is temporarily under the control of Russia, its army. In particular, the rescuers in Enerhodar who protested today deserve support from all of us. Thank you. Each and every one must show that the occupiers have no right to decide anything on our land. This is an important component of our victory. Another decree on awarding our defenders was signed today. 202 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. In total, during the full-scale war, more than 14,000 of our defenders have already been awarded for bravery and efficiency in defending the country and helping our people. Eternal glory to all who stood up for the state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine! And definitely the last one. Today is three years since I became President of Ukraine. Thank you for your trust. I am proud to be the President. Love you! I will not let you down! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! This day in our state has a double meaning. This is Science Day. And Europe Day. I congratulate our scientists, who, despite all the difficulties, nevertheless work to ensure that Ukraine preserves and develops its scientific potential. Of course, during a full-scale war, all the forces of society and the state can be aimed only at protection. And these are significant limitations for science, for the cultural sphere, for other fundamental parts of public life. But such is the time we live in. We are doing everything we can to return to the rules of peacetime as soon as possible. I would also like to express my gratitude to all those who are working to make Ukraine a part of a united Europe. To all our diplomats, to all our civil servants who now have a few weeks to complete the task that other countries have been overcoming for years when joining the European Union. And I want to emphasize that our European integration path is not just about politics. It's about quality of life. And about the fact that Ukrainians perceive the values of life in the same way as the vast majority of Europeans. I held talks with the Prime Minister of Portugal in Kyiv today. I thanked him for all the support that Portugal is currently providing to Ukraine. This is defense, political and humanitarian support. I am grateful for the warm treatment of our people who have taken refuge in Portugal. Further sanctions against the Russian Federation were discussed with the Prime Minister. And also - post-war reconstruction of our state. Portugal is ready to join the reconstruction of Ukraine, the reconstruction of Ukrainian schools and kindergartens. And I want to remind you that during the full-scale war, the Russian army has already destroyed 1873 educational institutions. This is a colossal scale of losses. But when a united Europe, American leadership and the whole free world stand with you, you can overcome that as well. I am grateful to President Biden for the immediate signing of the $ 40 billion support package for Ukraine approved by the US Congress. This is a historic contribution to the protection of freedom in Europe. I also spoke today with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. The main focus was on the situation on the battlefield and how Ukraine's victory can be brought closer. We agreed that the sixth package of sanctions against Russia should be accelerated. I am grateful for Italy's full support on our path to the European Union. The military situation has not changed significantly today. But it was really hard. Actually, the fact that we are able to say this on the 87th day of a full-scale war against Russia is good news. Russia has sent virtually all its resources to destroy us. In the Russian regions, it is openly said that their so-called \"special operation\" is the cause of the economic downturn - in particular, in the industries such as construction and many others. And also the reason for the impoverishment of people, which may be even greater than in the 1990s. Rising prices, devaluation of income, destruction of all the economic potential that has been created in Russia since the 2000s - all this does not stop the invaders yet. But the colossal costs of the war still do not help them. And will not help. The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult. As in previous days, the Russian army is trying to attack Slovyansk and Severodonetsk. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are deterring this offensive. Every day that our defenders take away from these offensive plans of Russia, disrupting them, is a concrete contribution to the approach of the main day. The desired day that we are all looking forward to and fighting for. Victory Day. And no Russian strikes - neither by missiles in the Rivne region, nor by artillery in the Kharkiv or Sumy region, nor by all possible weapons in Donbas - will give Russia any result. Today I signed a decree on awarding our heroes. 215 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 30 of them posthumously. Almost every day I have such decrees on my desk. On awarding our defenders. On conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine. And this reflects the severity of the military situation. Unfortunately, the war continues. The war is not over. We still need to fight and move towards victory. Maybe someone in the rear cities thinks that one can forget about the war. And become carefree. Or even careless. It isn’t so. Every day Ukrainians die for our independence. Every day! And each and every one of us must take care of our defense on a daily basis. With anything they can. In a way they can. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave lives for our state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Chairman, presidium. Dear people's deputies of Ukraine, Dear guests. Andrzej. Ladies and Gentlemen! Guest in the house, God in the house. This is a Polish proverb with which I greet in Kyiv our guest, friend and brother, President of Poland Andrzej Duda. This folk wisdom tells that each of your guests is a grace of God. And this is the worldview according to which the Poles from the very beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, Russia's war against Ukraine, sheltered millions of our citizens - citizens of Ukraine. Our women, our children, the elderly and everyone else whose door was knocked on on February 24 by completely different guests. Guests whom we never wanted to have and who have other proverbs and other folk wisdom. Russia has been proving this \"otherness\" for 88 days. 88 days of madness: their missiles, bombs, projectiles fly into houses, schools, hospitals, museums, theaters, temples, even cemeteries. At the same time, without realizing it, on February 24, Russia destroyed something else as well. A kind of \"repository\" of past contradictions between Ukraine and Poland. They no longer exist. In a day it became clear that all these contradictions have no force when there is the force of such a threat. Threat to the survival of our nations - Ukraine, Poland, the nations of Europe. Andrzej and I sought a true understanding between our nations, and together we dismantled this \"repository.\" We planned to build a Memorial of Reconciliation on the common border of Ukraine and Poland. But those who want other memorials, dedicated not to peace at all, have crossed Ukrainian borders.  February 24 changed everything. It changed our nations. Changed our countries. Although this is not accidental. I do not know whether our astronomers Drohobych and Copernicus studied this phenomenon, but the stars are always formed in such a way that during the most difficult periods of eclipse Ukrainians and Poles unite and stand side by side, despite past quarrels and \"nebulae\". We are defending a common universe for us called freedom and independence, at a time when someone is committing barbarism of a cosmic scale. Today the understanding, interaction, friendship and brotherhood of Ukraine and Poland reach the same scale. On February 24, we began writing a new volume of our history. Our common history - it is important. The unity of our nations must last forever. It must never again be dishonored by enmity. St. John Paul II called the incitement of hatred between us a blatant anachronism unworthy of our two great nations. In various letters to our nations, the Pontiff said: “The new millennium requires that Ukrainians and Poles not remain enslaved by sad memories of the past. By committing to a better future for all, let them look at each other with a look of reconciliation. Our two nations have experienced so much bitterness and pain over the past few decades. Let this experience serve as purification. Let everyone be willing to put what unites above what divides. Look for something that cures. So that together they may build a future based on mutual respect, brotherhood, fraternal cooperation and true solidarity.\" Learn to appreciate, distinguish, choose. Ukraine and Poland have chosen one path. This path. On it we learned to distinguish enemies and appreciate friends. Appreciate each other and most importantly - respect. The time that Jerzy Giedroyc and Bohdan Osadchuk dreamed of has come. About which Juliusz Słowacki, whose monument stands in Kyiv, and Taras Shevchenko, whose monument stands in Warsaw, wrote. Today, half a word is enough for Polish President Andrzej and I to understand each other. Our parliaments, our governments and our nations in general understand each other as never before. And it doesn't matter whether it is Cyrillic or Latin, it doesn't matter how we write the words \"freedom\" and \"independence\". It is important that Ukrainians and Poles say these things in the same way. And are equally ready to defend them. Ukraine is already doing this. On the very frontline. It defends not just itself but the whole of Europe. Poles know this, appreciate, respect and help Ukraine - not out of courtesy, but as brothers and allies who remember Lech Kaczyński's words about who could be next. This does not mean fear. This means readiness to face the enemy and repel him. That is why, for example, we have the same perception of the sanctions policy against the Russian Federation. We know that half-measures cannot be used when aggression needs to be stopped. Now. Poland is one of the leaders not only in supporting our state, but also in defending and promoting the sanctions that are absolutely necessary to force Russia into peace. The absolute majority of Poles support the embargo on energy resources from Russia. This is just one manifestation - but how important it is - of our common vision of the political front in this war. I believe that Poland's leadership will help establish at the European level what our nations already understand. The unity of our nations must remain constant. Neither now nor in the future does anyone have the right to break this unity. Neither our politicians, nor hostile agents, nor even members of the jury at Eurovision. The Ukrainian and Polish nations gave each other 12 points - today and forever. I want to thank all Poles for their support. I want to remember everyone from this rostrum. So that every voivodeship, powiat and gmina hears this. Whose support and help is felt in every region, every city, village, in every community of Ukraine. Thank you, Warsaw, Kraków. Thank you, Łódź, Poznań, Wrocław. Thank you Gdańsk, Bydgoszcz, Toruń. Thank you, Lublin, Katowice, Opole, Szczecin. Gorzów Wielkopolski, Zielona Góra. Thank you, Rzeszów, Białystok, Olsztyn, Kielce. These are sister cities of our cities - Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Kremenchuk, Kryvyi Rih, Cherkasy, Luhansk, Donetsk, Sumy, Izyum, Starobilsk, Mariupol. Almost all our cities are sister cities of those in Poland. Our nations are also brothers. Our countries are sisters. We are relatives. And there should be no borders or barriers between us. The Ukrainian and Polish nations have not been mentally separated for a long time. So we agreed to implement this in the near future in the relevant bilateral agreement. First on joint border and customs control, and later on the conditional border when Ukraine becomes a member of the European Union. And I am sure that all the necessary decisions will be made first for the status of a candidate for Ukraine, and then for full membership. In particular, thanks to Poland's many years of protection of Ukrainian interests on the European continent. And I am grateful for your willingness - for your willingness personally, Andrzej - to pay a visit to European capitals together with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová to lobby for Ukraine's membership in the European Union in countries - as they say, \"skeptics\". In fact, they are not skeptics, but future optimists. This is how I see our common very important task in this direction. Separately, I thank the Polish Sejm for the recently adopted law on assistance to the citizens of Ukraine. This is a completely unprecedented decision, according to which our citizens, who were forced to move temporarily to Poland due to the aggression of the Russian Federation, will receive almost the same rights and opportunities as Polish citizens. Legal residence, employment, education, medical care, social guarantees. This is a great step, a great gesture of a great soul, which only a great friend of Ukraine is capable of. And this step will not remain unilateral. I believe that in the near future we must submit to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a similar - mirror - bill. God forbid that Polish citizens will ever need all these advantages in such conditions, in conditions of war. But these laws are of great symbolic significance. They show that Ukrainians and Poles are native and equal. And I am sure that the parliamentary corps of Ukraine will support this law - quickly and, I am sure, by a majority of votes. In addition, before this speech, I signed a decree noting the special role of the Polish city of Rzeszów. I have introduced a special honorary title of \"rescuer city\" for the partner cities of our state, which today do the impossible to help us, to help our people, to help our army. On behalf of the entire Ukrainian people, I would like to express great gratitude to the city of Rzeszów, the first rescuer city. I also want to thank Polish cultural figures, sportsmen, clergy and ordinary people who support us - organize big concerts, take part in competitions with the Ukrainian ribbon, or come from Poznań to Bucha just to bake bread. I believe that soon Ukrainians and Poles will gather at one big table to share this bread. Share the feelings - the most important feelings - of peace. Share the taste of victory. Victory of Ukraine. Joint victory. And raise a toast to your and our freedom. Without a free Ukraine, there can be no free Poland. I know historians often argue about who was the first to say this, who was the author of this phrase. We have resolved this dispute - this is the will of the Ukrainian and Polish nations. Thank you brothers! Together until the end. Niech żyje Polska! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today was a real Polish day. I was glad to welcome the President of our fraternal Poland and my friend Andrzej Duda in Kyiv. First, on May 3, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson addressed our Verkhovna Rada online. And today - already personally - there was the President of Poland. And, by the way, this line of cooperation - Ukraine - Poland, Ukraine - Britain was really very effective and remains so during this war. I am glad to note that Ukrainian-Polish relations are finally on a completely clean, sincere basis, without any quarrels and old conflict heritage. This is an achievement. The historical achievement of our nations. And I want the brotherhood between Ukrainians and Poles to be preserved forever. As I said about this today to the deputies: for our unity, the unity of Ukrainians and Poles, to be a constant value that no one will violate. I signed a decree on the introduction of a new award of Ukraine - to thank those cities of partner countries that have helped the most. And Rzeszów became the first such city. The rescuer city. Quite rightly. Another decision I announced today is the preparation of a bill that will be a mirror image of the law on our citizens, Ukrainians, passed in Poland. What is this law? Ukrainian men and women temporarily staying in Poland fleeing the war have de facto and de jure been given the same opportunities as Poles. And it will be the right gesture to pass such a law in Ukraine. Let it be so that the citizens of Poland will never have to use such a law. But let us show our gratitude and our respect. And I also want it to be part of our new neighborhood policy. We must resolve disputes and remove the pressure of the past from our current relations with all Ukraine's neighbors who respect us and are not occupiers of our state. A decision has been reached that is revolutionizing the order on our border. We are introducing joint customs control with Poland. This will significantly speed up border procedures. It will remove most of the corruption risks. But it is also the beginning of our integration into the common customs space of the European Union. That is a truly historical process. Of course, Andrzej and I also talked today about the defense support for Ukraine. And about strengthening sanctions against Russia. And about the steps we need to take to achieve our common goal - full membership of Ukraine in the EU. I am grateful to Andrzej and all the Polish people for the fact that we are going along this path as quickly as possible. In the evening I spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. I told Boris about our meeting, about the negotiations, about the situation on the battlefield. We are looking for ways to increase the volume of our exports, especially agricultural products. As well as the volume of fuel imports to Ukraine. I am preparing to start a new week of maximum diplomatic activity in the interests of our state. On Monday I will join the discussions at the Davos Forum. This is the world's most influential economic platform where Ukraine has something to say. There will be other public speeches during the week, including an address to the Stanford University community. As well as a special format of communication with the political and expert communities of Indonesia. Of course, the schedule also includes a large number of contacts at the bilateral level with representatives of various states and international organizations. Our state expands its international ties every week to get everything it needs to end the war as soon as possible. There will be a new meeting of representatives of the partner countries - \"Ramstein-2\", if we call this group after the place of the first meeting in Germany. We look forward to new useful decisions for our defense. I signed a decree on awarding our military. 194 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 44 of them posthumously. Everyone should always remember these people. Those who give their lives for Ukraine. So that all generations of our people can live freely and choose independently with whom to be friends, whom to respect and what values to pass on to their children. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to each and every one whose lives were taken by the Russian invaders. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Executive Chairman, Professor Schwab, Dear President Cassis, Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear attendees! I am grateful for this opportunity to take part in the discussion at the Forum. The general theme of Davos this year is: History at a Turning Point: Government Policies and Business Strategies. And this year the words \"turning point\" are not just a rhetorical figure. This is really the moment when it is decided whether brute force will rule the world. If it reigns, our thoughts won’t matter to it. And we may no longer convene in Davos. Because what for? Brute force seeks nothing but the subjugation of those it wants to subdue. And it does not discuss, but kills at once, as Russia is doing in Ukraine right now, right at this time when we are talking. By the way, please look at the building of the former Russian House in Davos. It has been turned into a house of Russian war crimes. And this is an example of their transformation. What Russia has done to itself by becoming a state of war crimes. And what it brings to the world. Inspiring other potential aggressors. Instead of successful peaceful cities - black ruins. Instead of normal trade - mined sea and blocked ports in Ukraine. Instead of tourism - closed skies and thousands of Russian bombs and cruise missiles. This is what the world will look like if humanity misses this turning point. It will look like a very large collection of war crimes. So, history remembers many moments when everything changed dramatically. It remembers, for example, how just a few shots can lead to millions of casualties. If these were the shots on June 28, 1914 in Sarajevo. History remembers how much grief one person’s evil can cause if he sees that he is not being resisted enough. As it was, for example, in 1938 in Munich. Historical twists were noticeable and not as much. But it was always necessary to react to them. Trying to prepare for other historical upheavals - as they say, to soften the blow. Or - trying to heal the wounds of catastrophes that were behind one or another historical turn. And now we have a large collection of such reactions: the UN Charter with all units of the Organization, the OSCE, the IAEA, the WTO and many, many other important institutions. But are they enough to respond to what we are facing today? And is it enough now to try to adapt those institutions to modern challenges? Definitely not. We need to change the approach. Not to react, but to act. And act preventively. And not only to adapt what we have to the new realities, but also to create new tools. New precedents. Look at what Ukraine has already done. We have set a historical precedent for courage. Without listening to those who said that our defense would not last longer than a few days. We have stopped the Russian army, which was called the second in the world, and at the cost of heavy fighting and thousands of lives, we are gradually driving the occupiers out of our land. But would we have to do that if we had been listened to last year and if the full range of sanctions that can knock down any aggressor had been applied fairly and preventively against the Russian Federation? I'm sure the answer is “no”. Preventing war would be guaranteed if the world's actions had been preventive rather than responsive. Ukraine has set another precedent in these three months. A precedent for the unprecedented unity of the democratic world around the emotion of genuine admiration for Ukrainian courage and around the understanding that freedom must be fought for. And now hundreds of millions of people in democracies are putting pressure, supporting and putting pressure on the governments and companies to limit relations with the aggressor state, Russia, and to help the people they have attacked. But this is happening only now, although Russia started a war against Ukraine in 2014. We are grateful for such support, but if it had happened then - immediately - this unity and this pressure on governments, on companies for the struggle for freedom, would Russia have started this full-scale war and inflicted all these losses to Ukraine and the world? I am sure that the answer to this question is “no” as well. Now we see that the world listens and believes Ukraine. But there is also a certain expectation in the world how this situation will be resolved. What tools will work? What new can we create to prevent such aggressions? And how do we stop the brute force that has challenged everything we really value? That's what a turning point means. Ladies and Gentlemen! Don't wait for the fatal strikes. Don't wait until Russia uses special weapons - chemical, biological and, God forbid, nuclear. Do not give the aggressor the impression that the world will not show enough resistance. Protect freedom and normal, useful for all peaceful order in the world immediately and in full! That's what sanctions should be. Maximum. So that Russia and every other potential aggressor who wants to wage a brutal war against a neighbor knows exactly what this is leading to. And I think there are no such sanctions against Russia yet. And they must be imposed. Russian oil embargo. Complete blocking of all banks without exception - all. Complete abandonment of the Russian IT sector. Complete cessation of trade with the aggressor. This should be a precedent of sanctions pressure that will work convincingly for decades to maintain peace. It is necessary to set a precedent for the complete exit of all foreign businesses from the Russian market. So that your brands are not associated with war crimes. That your offices, accounts, commodities are not used by war criminals in their bloody interests. Values must matter. Especially since everyone suffers losses when a full-scale war begins and global markets are destabilized due to someone’s neglect of values. For our part, we offer every company that leaves the Russian market to continue operating in Ukraine. You will get access not only to our market of 40 million consumers, but also to the common market of Europe. And at the same time - your brands, positions will only be enhanced due to the fact that you really support the protection of freedom. Our representatives here in Davos can inform each and every one of you about the details of the prospects that Ukraine opens for businesses. Ladies and Gentlemen! We offer the world to set a precedent for rebuilding the country after the war, which will show everyone who dreams of destroying the life of a neighbor that the war doesn’t bring the expected result. I invite you to take part in this reconstruction. The amount of work is enormous. We have more than half a trillion dollars in losses. Tens of thousands of objects were destroyed. We need to rebuild entire cities, entire industries. And we offer a special - historically significant - model of reconstruction. When each of the partner countries or partner cities or partner companies will have the opportunity - historical one - to take patronage over a particular region of Ukraine, city, community or industry. Britain, Denmark, the European Union and other leading international actors have already chosen a specific direction for patronage in reconstruction. Thanks to this model of relations, post-war reconstruction can be fast, efficient and high-quality. And this will not only attract the world's best specialists - architects, engineers, builders, developers, managers and others. It will also be the largest opportunity for economic leap in Europe since World War II. And I hope that by the beginning of the international conference in Lugano in July this year dedicated to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, which Mr. Cassis spoke about, all our partner countries and most of the world's leading companies will have formed their own packages of proposals. By the way, given the presence of President Cassis today, I would like to thank Switzerland for organizing this Conference in Lugano and supporting our efforts. I would also like to note the efforts of Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, in particular the proposal to create a Reconstruction Platform, which will be managed jointly by Ukraine and the European Commission and will direct European Union resources to restore normal life in our country. However the list of new precedents needed will not be complete without a few more important decisions. There must be a precedent of punishment for the aggressor and investment in a peaceful life. Russian assets scattered in different jurisdictions must be found, arrested or frozen, and then confiscated and sent to a special Fund from which all victims of this war can receive compensation. Of course, this is not easy. But after that, there will be no motivation left for the various aggressors to do what Russia has done and continues to do. If the aggressor loses everything, it definitely deprives him of motivation to start a war. Let's move on. Any response to the mass famine is overdue by definition. The famine should be stopped only preventively - when it has not yet begun. But now there is no such tool in the world. We propose to create an organization of responsible and democratic food-exporting states that can act with respect for human rights and global trade rules. Our motivation is very simple. Whatever the turning points in history, humanity must have insurance against famine. And Ukraine is ready to provide a platform for the activities of such a new organization - a definitely needed one. And the last point. You know, this war of Russia against Ukraine convinces everyone that aid to the attacked state is more valuable the sooner it is provided. Weapons, finances, political support, sanctions against Russia - if we had received them one hundred percent of our needs in February, the result would be tens of thousands of lives saved. That is why Ukraine needs all the weapons we ask for, not just the ones we are given. That is why Ukraine needs finances. That's at least $ 5 billion a month. And all the funds needed for reconstruction. That is why the United24 Ukraine Recovery Fund was established. And we encourage you to join the support using this platform. Ukrainian state platform. For each donor, we give a specific proposal - how to help and where to send funds. Where the priority is now. The target nature of the work is an absolute priority. And in the future, under this brand, United24, we propose to create a global structure that can provide sufficient support within 24 hours for any country that has suffered a military attack, natural disaster or, for example, a pandemic. That is, we offer a new format of security guarantees. Based on what we went through. What we are going through now. There must be something that sets a precedent of absolutely timely assistance. To everyone who needs it. To preserve peace, to preserve life, to preserve social stability. That is, all the necessary elements for a normal economy. Like, for example, the 911 service, there must be a United24 that guarantees security on a global scale. Ladies and Gentlemen! George Marshall, a well-remembered man, said in 1947: \"Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.\" These words are still relevant today. My proposals are directed in the same way - against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. And of course against the war unleashed by Russia, which brings nothing but hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. To many in the world. Not just us. Therefore, in order to guarantee peace and tranquility, we must all act quickly and preventively. We must not be afraid to set new precedents. This is exactly what the world has long had to learn at various turning points, for which it paid a high price. This was the price for the fact that the world only reacted, not acted preventively. So, now we can do it differently. Finally in the right way. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Every day, addressing our people, I emphasize how difficult and at what cost it is to defend against Russian aggression. The occupiers are waging a very brutal war against us. Indeed, there has been no such war on the European continent for 77 years. Total war. When the enemy tries to destroy as many people and infrastructure as possible. The clearance of debris in Desna in the Chernihiv region has been completed. 87 dead. And these were only four missiles. In total, since February 24, the Russian army has launched 1,474 missile strikes at Ukraine, using 2,275 different missiles. The vast majority was aimed at civilian objects. In less than three months, there have been more than 3,000 air strikes by Russian aircraft and helicopters. What other country has withstood such a scale of strikes? Every time we tell our partners that we need modern anti-missile weapons, modern combat aircraft, we are not just making a formal request. We say that our request is the real lives of many people who would not have died if we had received all the weapons we are asking for. By the way, today, talking to the participants of the Davos Forum, which began its work, I spoke in particular about this. About the need to provide Ukraine with everything it needs to save the lives of our people. All our partners agree that Ukraine's struggle in the war against Russia is the protection of the common values of all countries in the free world. Our common freedom. And if so, then we have the right to count on full and urgent assistance, especially weapons. My every international negotiations, every address to parliaments or other foreign audiences is necessarily related to this topic. And I am grateful to all those partners who help and provide us with the necessary weapons and ammunition to overcome the advantage of the Russian army, especially in the amount of equipment and weapons. The most difficult fighting situation today is in Donbas. Bakhmut, Popasna, Severodonetsk - in this direction the occupiers have concentrated the greatest activity so far. They organized a massacre there and are trying to destroy everything living there. Literally. Nobody destroyed Donbas as much as the Russian army does now. And I am grateful to all our warriors who are holding their positions and have the courage to counterattack. Today in Kyiv, at the Mariyinsky Palace in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine, I presented the Orders of the Golden Star. To the warriors, as well as to the relatives of those of our Heroes who were posthumously awarded. In particular, to the sister of sailor Vitaliy Skakun. He was a sapper of the 137th Separate Marine Battalion of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Ostrogradsky. He died performing a combat mission in southern Ukraine. Thanks to his courage and heroism, we managed to significantly delay the offensive of the overwhelming forces of the enemy and save hundreds of lives of our soldiers. In this war - both from February 24 and from 2014 - the Marines proved their extraordinary bravery. They were among those units that heroically defended Mariupol. They took part in many important battles. And today - on the Day of the Marines - I express my sincere gratitude to all those who defend the state in these troops. The Russian occupiers are trying very hard to show that they allegedly will not give up the occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, the Kherson region, the occupied territory of the Zaporizhzhia region and Donbas. They are going on the offensive in some areas. Reserves are being accumulated in some areas. Somewhere they are trying to reinforce their positions. The coming weeks of the war will be difficult. And we must be aware of that. Yet we have no alternative but to fight. Fight and win. Free our land and our people. Because the occupiers want to take away from us not just something, but everything we have. Including the right to life for Ukrainians. However, to win, each and every one of us must work for it. And including those in the rear. Help the army. Protect the needs of our state in all international platforms to which you have access, in communication with foreign journalists, even just with your friends and acquaintances abroad. Every vote counts. Today, as every day, I worked to increase the pressure on Russia. Our representatives in Davos are working to give Ukraine more financial and humanitarian support. And for all diplomats of our state the absolute priority is weapons and ammunition for our state. In the evening I signed a decree on awarding our warriors. 161 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 42 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to everyone who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who are bringing our victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Strong people of our bravest country! All our defenders! The third month of our defense is over. This is a long time. A term not foreseen by the world's leading intelligence agencies. This was not even assumed by our enemies. And this is what motivates the world to look at our land, Ukraine, in a completely different way. This is three months of war crimes of the Russian occupiers. Three months of their strikes, destruction, blockade. And three months of mass exploits of our people who are defending their own land, their own country. 15,227 Ukrainian men and women were awarded state awards. 12,550 of them are servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 1801 warriors of the National Guard. 205 border guards. 182 police officers. 167 employees of the Security Service of Ukraine. 138 representatives of the State Emergency Service. 99 representatives of the Main Intelligence Directorate. 38 employees of the State Special Communications Service. And also - employees of the Department of State Protection, the Foreign Intelligence Service, NABU, SBI and the Judicial Protection Service, who also contributed to our defense. 155 Ukrainians were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine, 75 of them posthumously. 1016 settlements of Ukraine have already been de-occupied. And each of these figures is a story. A story of extraordinary courage and self-sacrifice. This is the heroic defense of Mariupol. These are stories of success in the battles for Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv. This is a heroic defense in Donbas. This is the defense of Odesa, Mykolaiv and our entire south. These are protests and resistance in those cities and communities of Ukraine that we have yet to liberate. We must always remember that we have survived these three months thanks to the tens of thousands of feats of all those who defend the state. And at the cost of tens of thousands of lives of Ukrainian men and women killed by the occupiers. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Another completely inadequate statement was made from Russia today that they were allegedly \"slowing down\" the offensive on purpose. Well, after three months of searching for an explanation why they failed to break Ukraine in three days, they came up with nothing better than to claim that they had allegedly planned to do so. Almost 30,000 Russian soldiers killed. More than 200 downed aircraft. Thousands of lost Russian tanks, armored vehicles and other equipment. Russian missile ammunition is almost completely used up. And they want to cover it up with lies that they are not fighting at full strength? Miserably. And the time will come when they themselves will admit it. Now the situation in Donbas is extremely difficult. In fact, all the strength the Russian army still has was thrown there to attack. Lyman, Popasna, Severodonetsk, Slovyansk - the occupiers want to destroy everything there. But in the interceptions of their conversations, we hear that they are well aware that this war does not make sense for Russia and that strategically their army stands no chance. But it takes time and still a lot of extraordinary efforts by our people to break their advantage in the amount of equipment and weapons. I am grateful to all the partners of Ukraine who help. But I emphasize again and again: the longer this war lasts, the greater will be the price of protecting freedom not only for Ukraine, but also for the whole free world. Therefore, the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine - MLRS, tanks, anti-ship and other weapons - is the best investment in maintaining stability in the world and preventing many severe crises that Russia is still planning or has already provoked. We continue to work to ensure that Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees after this war. In particular, an international advisory group headed by Yermak and former NATO Secretary General Rasmussen has been set up. The group will include leading experts in the fields of security and defense, diplomacy. Their task is to develop a format of guarantees that will really work. And not for several months or years, but during the lifetime of many generations of our Ukrainians. I spoke today with President of the European Council Charles Michel. At the end of May, an important meeting of the European Council will be held on assistance to Ukraine. So we coordinated our positions. In particular, on strengthening sanctions on Russia. I also spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. First of all, about the defense support for Ukraine. About further political cooperation and providing our state with all the assistance, including financial, which is so necessary to beat the occupiers. I held a meeting with the leaders of the Crimean direction of our policy. In particular, with Tamila Tasheva, Permanent Representative of the President of Ukraine to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The Russian invasion began in Crimea. This was not the first item on the list of mistakes of the Russian state towards Ukraine, but the first fateful one for Russia itself. It is from this point that the following, no less fateful mistakes of Russia came, which all together will lead to its historical weakening. And, of course, the occupiers will have to leave Crimea, too. As well as Kherson, Melitopol, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all other cities and communities where they still pretend to be the masters. They will definitely not be the masters there. I am grateful to each and everyone who helps bring this time of liberation of our territory and peace closer. I am grateful to all our military, intelligence officers, border guards, sappers, rescuers, doctors, nurses, police officers, National Guard, communications service employees, diplomats, volunteers, journalists, all transport workers, Ukrzaliznytsia, workers of the energy sector. To everyone who provides logistics. To everyone who organizes the evacuation. To everyone who restores life in the liberated territory. To everyone who continues to teach pupils, to teach students. To everyone who keeps business and, consequently, jobs for our citizens. To everyone who works, saves, helps and promotes Ukrainian interests in the world. I am grateful to everyone who decided to be with Ukraine on February 24. We will definitely win! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! I started this day by talking to the participants of the Ukrainian Breakfast, which took place within the Davos Forum. I want to say something about why I take part in such events, and what others are saying, particularly in Davos this year. The world turned out not to be ready for Ukrainian bravery. For the bravery of all our people who are not inferior to Russia and continue to defend our state. Remember how it all began on February 24, when many in the world did not even believe that Ukraine would be able to withstand a full-scale war. Was that so? It was. And why was that so? Not because all these people who doubted were equally mistaken when assessing the potential of our state. But because many of them did not even begin to assess. Many of them simply did not want to take Ukraine into account. There was no such habit - to take Ukraine into account. Although they have a habit of taking Russia into account. Even when there are no objective reasons for this. It is convenient for them. And really habitual. Often very profitable. Calling certain Russian politicians \"Dostoevsky's heroes\", as if it serves as an excuse for them. Talking about the alleged historical sphere of influence of Russia. And about the alleged balance in relations in Europe, which is allegedly impossible without Russia. No matter what the Russian state does, there is always someone who says: let's take its interests into account. This year in Davos it was heard again. Despite thousands of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. Despite tens of thousands of Ukrainians killed. Despite Bucha and Mariupol, etc. Despite the destroyed cities. And despite the \"filtration camps\" built by the Russian state, in which they kill, torture, rape and humiliate like on a conveyor belt. Russia has done all this in Europe. But still in Davos, for example, Mr. Kissinger emerges from the deep past and says that a piece of Ukraine should be given to Russia. So that there is no alienation of Russia from Europe. It seems that Mr. Kissinger's calendar is not 2022, but 1938, and he thought he was talking to an audience not in Davos, but in Munich of that time. By the way, in the real year 1938, when Mr. Kissinger's family was fleeing Nazi Germany, he was 15 years old, and he understood everything perfectly. And nobody heard from him then that it was necessary to adapt to the Nazis instead of fleeing them or fighting them. Symptomatic editorials began to appear in some Western media stating that Ukraine must allegedly accept so-called difficult compromises by giving up territory in exchange for peace. Perhaps The New York Times in 1938 also wrote something similar. But now, let me remind you, it is 2022. And behind all these geopolitical speculations of those who advise Ukraine to give away something to Russia, \"great geopoliticians\" are always unwilling to see ordinary people. Ordinary Ukrainians. Millions of those who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace. You must always see people. And remember that values are not just a word. That is why I pay such attention to international platforms, addresses to parliamentarians, to parliaments, to the people of other countries, to communication with the expert community, with journalists, with students. We must do everything possible for the world to get a permanent habit of taking Ukraine into account. So that the interests of Ukrainians are not overlapped by the interests of those who are in a hurry for another meeting with the dictator. That's why I always have a lot of international communication in my schedule. Yesterday and today - Davos. Tomorrow - the Parliament of Latvia. The day after tomorrow - Stanford and Indonesia. Then - just as actively. I spoke with Austrian Chancellor Nehammer. I informed him about the situation in Donbas and other areas of hostilities. Expressed gratitude for the support. We agreed that Austria would take our severely wounded servicemen for treatment. Cooperation in the European integration of Ukraine was discussed in detail. I also spoke with the President of Liberia today. The main topic of conversation was the counteraction to the food crisis provoked by the Russian Federation. Expressed gratitude for the support for our sovereignty and territorial integrity, in particular at the UN platform. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and all those who defend the state are resisting the extremely fierce offensive of Russian troops in the east. In some areas, the enemy is substantially superior in terms of equipment, number of soldiers. The Russian authorities have made an illustrative decision - they have allowed to hire older people for contract service. That is, they no longer have enough young people, but the desire to fight still remains. It still takes time to discourage them from this. We still need the help of partners, especially weapons for Ukraine. Total help! No exceptions, no restrictions. Enough to win. That's what those who really value people are talking about. And I am grateful to everyone who spoke about it, including in Davos. Who talks about it in the media and in the capitals of leading countries. Despite pressure from all those stuck in the XX century, when the interests of nations were indeed often traded for attempts to appease the appetites of dictators. I signed a decree today on awarding our heroes. 144 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 17 of them posthumously. And, of course, I would like to congratulate the communications service employees on their professional day - the Day of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine. This is one of the most sensitive areas in modern warfare. Our joint success directly depends on the quality of your work, dear communications service employees. The success of our entire state. By my decree, I conferred the military rank of brigadier general upon three colonels of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection. I am grateful to everyone who defends the state! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mrs. Speaker, Mrs. Ināra! First of all, thank you for such kind words, thank you for your arrival, thank you for this support. Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear deputies of the Saeima! Dear Latvian people! I am glad to have the opportunity to address you today and, above all, to thank you for all the help that Ukraine has received from the Republic of Latvia and from many ordinary citizens of Latvia. You perceive our struggle for freedom as your own struggle. And this is true - because right now in Ukraine the fate of all of us, all Europeans, is being decided. It is the strength of weapons in the war that Russia has launched against our country, against Ukraine, and at the same time against the freedom of all its neighbors, that determines what will dominate in Europe for decades to come. Either it will be justice for every nation we strive for with you, or Russia will manage to make the words \"occupation\", \"repression\", \"deportation\" main again for different nations. I am grateful to you for the determination you’ve stood up for justice with. As early as 6 pm on February 23, \"Stingers\" from Latvia arrived in Ukraine. The weapons we received from you, from the first hours of Russia's full-scale aggression, began to save the lives of our people. While many others hesitated, looking for excuses, you were among those who acted. And continue to help us to the maximum now. In the defense sphere, with the support for sanctions, humanitarian support and extremely warm attitude to our citizens who have found temporary shelter in Latvia. Ukraine will always remember your help. I am grateful to you for this, grateful for this help! So why did it happen that someone resolutely chooses the path of action and support, and someone does everything to really do nothing? Why can those who do not have great resources show great courage, and some quite powerful actors in global relations do not find in themselves a percentage of the power you have? Why can they tolerate criticism for cowardice, double standards and hypocrisy, even accusations of direct indulging in Russian aggression just to stay away and maintain contacts with Russia? There are various answers to these questions. Of course, often the answer is just money. There are those who are just looking for benefits and are able to think only about profits, interest and account statements. There are those who hope in vain that they will be able to pacify Russia if they remain silent and do not really fight aggression. But, in fact, these are not decisive factors. They are an add-on. The basis of everything is contempt for values. There are people - and many of them among the powerful of this world - who believe that not all nations matter. Who believe that a nation can simply be forgotten to try to keep peace. Even the temporary peace, even the illusory one. Even peace at the cost of tens of thousands killed, hundreds of thousands deported or millions deprived of their homeland. They are OK with that. Peace at the cost of the lives of others. But this should not be normal! In the past - and even in the very recent past - this disrespect for certain nations has led to terrible and insidious conspiracies and pacts that deprived statehood, destroyed borders and inflamed the appetite for war. Millions of people died because of it. The lives of generations have been poisoned. And it seemed that at least Europe and the Western world drew conclusions from their experience. But now we hear again that Russia should be given what it wants. That supposedly it is necessary to accept that some nations may be deprived of part of their foreign policy rights, because certain, as they say, \"historical force\" wants it. There are quite serious talks about drawing some dividing lines along the body of a sovereign state in order to allegedly \"appease\" the aggressor. And allegedly concessions, concessions and concessions again are needed - of course, at the expense of the state, which was attacked, so that the aggressor allegedly mercifully stops. And this is about Ukraine, which has been defending itself for the fourth month already in a full-scale war against the second strongest army in the world. And what will happen if Russia starts a war against states that have less internal potential for defense than Ukraine? Will the world help such states? Or will they be given up without any disputes at all? And it's not just some speculation - it's a reality. This is our reality. In Russia, they openly say that they will not stop in Ukraine. They need the Baltic states, Poland and other European countries. That is why we must restore full respect for the fundamental values on our continent. We must fight absolutely clearly and at all levels for the principle: every nation matters. The interests of any nation cannot be ignored, betrayed or exchanged for something in a relationship with those who want to make that nation dependent on themselves. When this principle is truly respected by all, in full, then European unity will work. And then Russia will stand no chance either in the war against Ukraine or in the war against any other European country. When Ukraine is told that we should not be given all the weapons we need to win, they actually mean that our nation is allegedly less important than other nations who have already been given or can use such weapons. When we are told that we have to give away part of our land because it is supposed to be a \"necessary compromise\", it means that our people are considered less worthy of having their interests taken into account. Moreover, when they ask us to wait “a little longer” in the European Union's reception room - years or decades - not agreeing to give us full membership, and some still doubt the candidate status for Ukraine, it only emphasizes that the principle of respect for every nation does not work. And it must work. Because if Russia starts a war, say, against any state, God forbid Latvia, all NATO members will have to decide whether to defend Latvia. If Russia provokes an emergency crisis on the borders or inside a country of the European Union, all EU members will have to decide whether to provide help. And what will they be able to decide if there is no respect for each nation? We must do our best to never see the obvious answer to the question asked this way. Ladies and Gentlemen! On March 1, at a meeting in Riga Castle, a decision was made to award me the Order of Viesturs of the first degree - the highest award of the Republic of Latvia. It is a great honor for me. But I perceive this as a distinction not of my personal activity, but of our common struggle. The struggle of the Ukrainian people for independence. The struggle of the Latvian people for freedom in Europe. The struggle of all Europeans, who truly respect our common values, for Europe to be truly strong and truly united. We need this unity to guarantee the security of both Ukraine and every other state that may be threatened by Russian aggression. We need the strength and unity of Europe for Russia to pay for this war - to pay the full price, in particular through sanctions and the confiscation of its assets. Having experienced these losses, it must learn that war creates the greatest problems for the aggressor first of all. It is necessary not only to finally agree on the sixth sanctions package against the Russian Federation, including the embargo on oil, oil blends and petroleum products. But also to prepare the seventh sanctions package - with even more powerful restrictions on Russia for terror against Ukraine. Just like Latvia, the whole of Europe must restrict Russia's energy weapons. Fully. And, of course, we need the full potential of Europe to bring to justice those who organized and are carrying out genocide against the people of Ukraine in a competent court. And I am grateful to your state, to your President, Mr. Levits, for initiatives that will help bring Russian war criminals to justice. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Latvian people! Our parents hoped that the war would not hit our generation. That you and I would not be threatened by what previous generations had to endure. Occupation, repression, deportation… We have everything we need to eliminate these threats. And I'm sure we'll do it. Together. And guided by our values. Paldies, Latvija! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Exactly eight years ago, on May 26, the Donetsk airport stopped working. There is still a message about this: \"Attention! From 7 am, Donetsk Airport will temporarily suspend flights. The resumption of the airport’s functioning will be announced additionally.\" On that day, apparently, no one foresaw how events in Donbas would develop over these years. And then - throughout Ukraine after a full-scale invasion. No one predicted for how long the word \"temporarily\" would be delayed in this announcement. But that day and any day later, and today, two things can be said with confidence. First. Ukraine will always be an independent state and will not be broken. The only question is what price our people will have to pay for their freedom, and Russia - for this senseless war against us. And second. The catastrophic developments could have been stopped if the world had treated the situation in Ukraine as its own. If the strong of the world had not played with Russia, but really pressed to end the war. Just look at the situation now. Look at the number of weeks the European Union has been trying to agree on a sixth package of sanctions against Russia. So far, it receives almost a billion euros a day from Europeans for energy supplies. Of course, I am grateful to our friends who are promoting new sanctions. But where did those who block the sixth package get so much power? Why are they still allowed to have so much power, including in intra-European procedures? Look at the number of weeks the world has not dared to block the Russian banking system - all banks without exception, to deprive the aggressor of the opportunity to finance not only the war against us, but also the policy of creating splits and crises around the world. Look at how long we have been struggling to provide Ukraine with all the weapons it needs to change the nature of hostilities and start moving faster and more confidently to the expulsion of the occupiers. All weapons, including MLRS. The systems that are really needed to stop this aggression. We are confident that thanks to our efforts we will still be heard. Starting from May 26, 2014, and even more so from February 24 this year until today, there have been many opportunities for those who really have the strength to do so to put an end to it and say: now Russia will really feel the full price for what it is doing against Ukraine, against European unity and against freedom as such. The current offensive of the occupiers in Donbas can make the region uninhabited. They want to burn Popasna, Bakhmut, Lyman, Lysychansk and Severodonetsk to ashes. Like Volnovakha, like Mariupol. In cities and communities closer to the Russian border, in Donetsk and Luhansk, they gather everyone they can to fill the place of those killed and wounded in the occupation contingent. All this, including the deportation of our people and the mass killings of civilians, is an obvious policy of genocide pursued by Russia. Today, the occupiers shelled Kharkiv again. At the moment, the list of the dead includes nine people. 19 wounded. All civilians. A child (five months) and a father were killed. The mother is in grave condition. Among the wounded in Kharkiv is also a nine-year-old girl. Missile strikes again in the Sumy region, in Donbas again. Significant intensification of the occupiers' artillery in the Zaporizhzhia region again. Again, their efforts to burrow into the ground in the south. Pressure on Russia is literally a matter of saving lives. And every day of delay, weakness, various disputes or proposals to \"appease\" the aggressor at the expense of the victim is new killed Ukrainians. And new threats to everyone on our continent. I addressed the Latvian parliament and people today. Expressed gratitude for the help Ukraine received, including the defensive one. And for the help which the Latvian state and the Latvian people provide now. If everyone in the world had the same determination to defend our common freedom as Latvia and other partners who do not hesitate, there would simply be no evil that the Russian state has done to Ukraine, Europe and the world. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. I informed him about the situation on the battlefield, about the intensification of the occupiers' activities. We discussed how we can adequately enhance Ukraine's ability to defend itself and repel these attacks. I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 180 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 28 of them posthumously. The total number of awarded servicemen as of today is over 16,000. Precisely - 16 thousand and 44. In 92 days. But it is clear that there are hundreds and hundreds of times more feats and victories of our defenders. I am grateful to everyone who holds the defense. Who helps the army and all our defenders. And finally. Usually these days in May we celebrate the last bell in schools and congratulate boys and girls on the beginning of a new stage in life. Frankly, a brighter stage than childhood. Because finally opportunities in life emerge. Adult opportunities. But childhood is still not over yet. This year there is no traditional school holiday in Ukraine. And this is understandable. Such a time. Such a situation. And not all schools in Ukraine finish the education process in May this year. And not all graduates are now in our country. But the constant thing is whatever the time and whatever the situation, we must not lose our opportunities. We have to fight. We have to develop. We have to defend our freedom and be able to use that freedom. So, we have to be educated and brave. Don't lose a single day in your life. Know what you live the day for. And be sure to believe in Ukraine. Because it is here that Ukrainians have the best chance of success. And especially - after our victory. Which we will definitely gain. And we will definitely remove the phrase \"temporarily occupied\" in relation to our land, which will be liberated forever. No matter how difficult it may be. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen. Thank you for the opportunity to contact you today and for the upcoming communication. I hope that this conversation will bring us closer to understanding how to prevent large-scale crises from unfolding in many parts of the world. And the world is now really on the verge of several crises. My country, Ukraine, is one of the largest and absolutely conscientious food exporters. Every year we export tens of millions of tons of grain and other agricultural products. Our producers provide a high place for Ukraine in the world's top exports of wheat, corn and vegetable oil. But for the fourth month in a row, Ukrainian exports have been blocked due to a full-scale war waged by Russia against our state on our territory. Russia has blocked access to our ports in the Black Sea and occupied our part of the Sea of Azov. As a result of this military blockade, most traditional Ukrainian trade routes have been closed. Currently, 22 million tons of grain in Ukraine are in storage facilities. We cannot direct them to the world market, where they are needed right now, at this time. It is already felt that prices for grain, and later for other food, could rise catastrophically. And the governments of food-exporting countries have to adopt decisions to suspend the export of certain agricultural products from their countries to somehow keep domestic prices from explosive growth and protect their own consumption. According to the UN, this year the world's hunger will affect an additional 40-50 million people. I consider such an assessment conservative. Hunger does not come alone. It is always accompanied by political chaos, which further aggravates the situation, destroys social life and creates even more dangerous conditions for ordinary people. Already in July - when last year's stockpiles will run out in many countries - it will become clear that the catastrophe is really approaching. Just look at the prices in stores now - their growth is a harbinger of what will surely affect people if nothing changes, if we can't change anything. It is a harbinger of poverty for the poor and impoverishment for the middle class. Just imagine the political chaos this could end with in certain regions. And I have cited only one aspect of how the war waged by Russia affects the whole world. And there are many such aspects, in addition to the threat of hunger and chaos. The very fact of Russia's naval blockade of Ukraine is no less destabilizing for coexistence in the world. This is not just an act of aggression by one state against another. This blockade of our ports is a kind of training for other potential aggressors who want to conquer neighbors or take away their territory. If Russia manages to go unpunished with this in the war against Ukraine, other states will see that the naval blockade is a supposedly permissible instrument of pressure in the modern world. Consequently, none of the trade routes at sea and no country will be safe after that. Let’s take the third aspect - the nature of the war waged by the Russian state against us. Since February 24 this year, the Russian army has used 2,400 different missiles against Ukraine. The vast majority was aimed at civilian infrastructure. The enterprises, warehouses, in particular warehouses with food, apartment houses, railway infrastructure. By the way, this is also important in terms of food security. We want to prevent the food crisis from unfolding. We are working to shift our exports to new routes - as much as possible in wartime - and to supply grain to the world market by rail through European ports. Of course, this may be a smaller volume of exports than through the Black Sea. But Russia is also trying to thwart our efforts by destroying railway bridges, railway stations and logistics centers with missiles. Dozens of Ukrainian cities and hundreds of villages were destroyed by shelling by Russian aircraft and artillery. It's just ruins. Black, scorched, empty cities. In three months, Russian warplanes have appeared in our skies more than 3,000 times. And there are no objects that they would try not to bomb. More than 600 healthcare facilities were destroyed - hospitals, maternity hospitals, clinics and outpatient clinics. Almost two thousand educational facilities - universities, schools, and kindergartens. Dozens of religious sites - churches, mosques, and other meeting places of religious communities - were burned or damaged by Russian shelling in various regions of Ukraine. Only yesterday and only in one of our cities, in Kharkiv, 9 people died as a result of Russian artillery strikes. Among them - a 5-month-old child and her father. The explosion threw the child from her father's arms onto the roof of the house. She was not even found at first. The mother was seriously wounded. The Russian military fired at ordinary residential neighborhoods. And this is the daily reality of our country since February 24. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine began much earlier. Back in 2014, Russia captured our Crimean peninsula and started a war in Donbas - in two regions of our country. This war remained local for 8 years, until Moscow decided to go on the offensive against our entire state. What is the meaning of this war for Russia? They talk about it openly. The Russian leadership believes that Ukraine should be a colony of Russia. And the Ukrainians? If the nation does not want to submit, it is decided to destroy it. The occupiers are also deporting our people to Russia and settling them in various remote regions. The number of such deported Ukrainians is hundreds of thousands. And this is also one of the ways to conquer the people. In fact, it is shocking how frankly Russia is trying to bring back to world life the order of the old days, when colonizers and empires imposed their policies or their domination on other nations. The fourth aspect is the attitude of the Russian occupiers towards the people in the occupied territories. We have the experience of Crimea, which since 2014 has been under control of Russia as an occupier. And it has become one of the most dangerous places in Europe. For all those who value freedom, for the indigenous people of Crimea - the Crimean Tatars, and for Muslims on the peninsula. There is not a single week - I emphasize this: not a single week in 8 years - that there is no news of repressions or trials against those whom the occupiers are not satisfied with. As a result, you will not find a place in Europe other than the Russian-occupied Crimea, where Muslims and all others who simply want to live their free lives are being repressed with such impunity and massiveness. How can this be ignored? This is happening in front of the eyes of the whole world! And the fifth aspect is that there has long been no such risk of using weapons of mass destruction. Russian state propagandists are openly threatening nuclear weapons. World politicians are preparing for the possibility of Russia's use of so-called tactical nuclear weapons or chemical weapons, biological weapons. What does this mean for the world? First of all, it can lead to a change in the attitude of different states to weapons of mass destruction. If Russia indulges in nuclear blackmail with impunity, it may seem logical to various forces in the world to acquire nuclear weapons for themselves. To say that it is dangerous for the whole world is to say nothing. Ukraine has made the greatest contribution to nuclear disarmament by relinquishing its third largest nuclear arsenal. This happened in the 1990s. Now Russia, contrary to its documented commitment to guarantee Ukraine's security after our state's renunciation of its nuclear status, is waging a war of aggression and colonization against us. And at the same time threatens with nuclear weapons. Who can believe in the idea of nuclear disarmament after that? And how to reliably guarantee long-term security to those regions that choose non-nuclear status after that? Six months ago, it was impossible to imagine that such questions would arise. But now it is also one of the consequences of Russia's aggressive policy. Ladies and Gentlemen! I have given you only 5 aspects of how Russia's war against Ukraine affects the global situation. I'm sure you realize that there are many more such aspects. This is the largest war in Europe since World War II. And today no one can predict one hundred percent what negative aspects for the world will definitely not be caused by this war. The sooner this war can be ended, the better it will be for each nation. Not just for us. The sooner our ports are unblocked, the sooner the food crisis will stop, because we will be able to send our stocks and new crops to the world market. Which this year, by the way, will still be less, as Russian troops deliberately mined fields and destroyed agricultural machinery. I believe that Russia has deliberately made a bet on the food crisis. To increase the dependence of other countries on themselves and to make access to food another factor of pressure in global politics. The sooner our lands are liberated from the occupiers, the more secure, in fact, will be the protection of people all over the world. Protection from the aggressive desires of those who want to pursue colonial policies, as in the old days. If the world is truly united and honest about this Russian aggression against our sovereign state, the speed of ending this war will be measured in weeks. Weeks, not even months. I am grateful to the leader of your country, the President of Indonesia, for inviting me to the G20 summit in the autumn. I accepted this invitation. And I believe that by the summit in the autumn, the world will have solved all these big problems. We must prevent large-scale famine. We must stop mass killings and repression. We must permanently wean any countries in the world from nuclear blackmail and playing with the threat of chemical or biological weapons. And I believe that at this Summit there will be only friendly states, partner states, and there will be no occupiers. I ask all Indonesians to pray for peace in Ukraine, for the people of Ukraine and for the wisdom of the world to be enough to save humanity from existing threats. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear friends! It is truly an honor to address your community for a second time - the Stanford University community - students, lecturers, all American men and women who care about Ukraine and empathize with our struggle for freedom. I am grateful to you for your interest and for such a number of sincere and caring bright eyes that I see now, see today. I see people in front of me, people who are not in bulletproof vests, who are not in helmets and who are not in bomb shelters. There are no wounded by enemy shelling among you. I am very glad. Glad for you. And this meeting of ours cannot be interrupted by an air alarm signal, because California is not threatened by Russian missiles. But, unfortunately, this is not the case in Ukraine. A lot has changed since last September, when I first visited Stanford during a visit to the United States. But on the other hand - much remains the same. As I said then, Ukraine is a country where anything is possible. And so it was. But now the whole world knows that even what others have been afraid to think about for many years is possible in Ukraine. Ukraine is a country that has destroyed the myth of the extraordinary power of the Russian army. An army that allegedly could conquer anyone it wants in a few days. But Ukraine is a country where the Russian army continues to wage a war it does not want to end. Now Russia is trying to occupy the whole country. But we feel strong enough to think about the future of Ukraine, which is and will be open to the world. Between September last year and May this year, our society has endured so much that I would not wish on any other nation. And we still have a new path to go from May this year to, say, the new September. I know that this path will be very difficult. Very painful. It will be a path on which young people won’t look at university professors or their friends from a peaceful life, as you do. But at their comrades in the trenches. And at the enemies who can be seen in sight or on video from reconnaissance drones. But I also know that for Ukraine on this path there will definitely be a stage where peace will begin. Now I use words that each and every one of you read and hear very often in the media, in books. \"Struggle for freedom\", \"myth\", \"Russian army\", \"war\", \"survived\", \"trenches\", \"path\", \"peace\". Each of these words seems to be immediately clear. But do you feel all their depth now? Yesterday, Russian troops again shelled the largest city in the east of our country - Kharkiv. Using MLRS and special artillery called \"Pion\". This is heavy artillery - long range and powerful. It was with these weapons that the Russian army fired at ordinary residential areas of Kharkiv yesterday. Just houses. There was no military object there. As a result of this and other shellings, 9 people were killed in Kharkiv yesterday. Peaceful inhabitants. A family with a small child, 5 months old, was also shelled. The father died. The child died. The mother is badly wounded. We have been receiving such or similar messages for 93 days since February 24 and for 8 years since 2014. That's how it is in Ukraine. Everyone who studies at Stanford is equally familiar with the question: what matters most to you and why? To study at your university, you need to write an essay in response to this question. And I'm sure a lot of brilliant essays have been written over the years at Stanford. And I am sure that in the last 8 years there have been many brilliant students at your university. Apparently, among them were those who survived the war. And their answers to this question - what matters most to you and why - probably differed significantly from the answers of those who were lucky enough to live in peace. And now I'm not talking about the quality of the text. I'm talking about the depth of the sense of words by a particular person. After the start of the full-scale war, we are holding a special award ceremony in Ukraine for our defenders. Those who excelled the most. And who was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. As a special tribute, I present the Order of the Golden Star to the Heroes of Ukraine in the hall of the presidential residence where the highest officials of foreign countries visiting Ukraine - presidents and heads of government - were usually met. Or I give the Order to the Hero's relatives, if this title is awarded posthumously. One of our pilots was recently awarded. Combat aviation pilot. One of the best. He died in the battles for Ukraine. When I gave his Golden Star to his wife, I expressed my condolences. Condolences that he passed away. And tears appeared in her eyes. She replied that he had not passed away. That he had been in the sky for 30 years. And now he remained in the sky. And tears appeared in my eyes. I felt that death did not conquer these people, this family. He remained in the sky. He is alive to her. And it will always be so in this family. And all these words: \"sky\", \"life\", \"death\", \"Hero\" - for him, for her, for me, for you - they are different. With their depth. Although these words sound the same to us. And this depth, this distance in the feelings, in fact, weighs a lot today. It explains, for example, why even on the 93rd day of the war we are forced to talk about increasing sanctions on Russia, which will be enough for this country to finally start looking for peace, at least thinking about it. It explains why it is sometimes so long and difficult for us to negotiate with our partners about the supply of exactly the weapons needed to liberate our land. Although they want to help. So for me, this question, on which you had to write an essay, feels different, a little different. Because, in fact, I have been answering this question for a very long time, more than 93 days, when I try to give my country everything it needs so that we can survive, defend our freedom and, in the end, win. What matters most to me and why? I do not know whether the current presidents of a state fighting for its freedom have ever answered this question. But here is my answer. Pragmatic. Weapons that will help overcome the technical and quantitative superiority of the Russian army. Sanctions that will stop the flow of money for Russian terror. Finances that will allow Ukraine to maintain social normalcy while the war continues. Blockade and confiscation of all Russian assets in foreign jurisdictions that should be used to rebuild everything that this Russian army has destroyed. A fair tribunal against all war criminals who killed, tortured, raped and deported our citizens. Updated efficient security architecture that will prevent such new wars in the world. And, of course, a complete restoration of normal peaceful life in our country. So that our people, our students, like you now, can communicate freely and in complete safety with the presidents of democratic states. So that Ukrainians, like you now, won’t need to think where the bomb shelter is. And so that they will not need to know what the air alarm sounds like at all. And I am grateful to all our friends in the world who make these words - and their depth - sound the same for everyone on whom decisions to help Ukraine depend. Many Ukrainians have recently learned about one of our boys. A child from Mariupol, a city that was completely destroyed by Russian shelling. This little boy in the evacuation was very grateful to all those who sheltered his family and other residents of Mariupol. He really wanted to thank those who helped. He invited everyone to pay a visit to him. He said - come to us next summer, to Mariupol. And he says: yes, there is no more city... but the sea is left! And this story is about life. Which is sure to win. And which matters most, in fact, for each and every one. And this story is about a man who remains sincere and grateful even in the most terrible circumstances, because he is a free man. And I believe that Ukrainians, having survived this war, will remain just that. Sincere, grateful and free. And I'm sure that after this war, something will change in the relationship between you - the American people - and us. It is already changing. We became much closer in our feelings. We know for sure that we mean the same thing when we say the word \"freedom.\" When I returned to Ukraine last September, I was very encouraged. I thought about how much we could do together. But now I feel a similar uplift. Because I see your eyes and I believe that many of you will be in Ukraine and will help our reconstruction after the war, because this is the biggest project on the protection of freedom, in which your generation can take part. Our cities are destroyed. Our sea is still blocked. But we remain free. And finally. On February 24, a full-scale war against Ukraine began, when 18-year-old Russian guys, military men, entered our country and entered the homes of our people. To kill, torture, rape. It is difficult to understand - for what? Difficult. And exactly three months later, on May 24, on the other side of the globe, in Texas, an 18-year-old guy entered a regular school to kill 19 children and 2 adults. It is impossible to understand at all. This is a tragedy. And we live in a terrible time when Americans express condolences to Ukrainians over the deaths in war. And Ukrainians express condolences to Americans over the deaths in peace. Please accept my condolences. Every day you should not just ask yourself another question, but be sure to find the answer: who matters most and why? This is the main question for me: who matters most and why? Take care of yourself, your family, loved ones, friends. Take care of the world. Thank you, America! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Unbreakable people of our bravest country! All our defenders! Today I want to begin this address with words of gratitude to all emergency care workers. Today is their professional holiday. These are people who are really indomitable, really brave, really committed to a good cause. It is impossible to even count how many lives were saved by emergency care workers. No matter what the conditions are, no matter what the time is, they always do their job. I am grateful to everyone for a really quick help and really dedicated work. Grateful for the work during the pandemic. I am grateful that now, during a full-scale war, people have access to the \"ambulance\" in areas of hostilities. I am grateful for the real heroism, which is shown everywhere - by both paramedics and drivers. Unfortunately, this war also took the lives of those who did everything to save others. Eternal memory to them! Today, the representatives of our state - the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health - presented awards to emergency care workers. And this is the minimum that the state can do to honor what they are doing. But there will definitely be a maximum. Before this war, until February 24, we did everything to raise the salaries of the emergency care employees to a decent level. And we will definitely continue this policy when we achieve peace for our country. I held a meeting with the Cabinet of Ministers today. Heard the reports on a wide range of issues. I expect greater activity from government officials. In particular, to overcome the shortage of fuel caused by Russian strikes at the refinery in Kremenchuk and oil depots in different regions of the country. And to provide jobs for our people. And on other important economic issues. I continue to gather the broadest possible international support for our struggle. Today I addressed the political and expert communities of Indonesia. We talked about the threats that Russia has created for every country in the world now. The food crisis alone means a lot. Due to the Russian blockade of our ports, there is a shortage of food in the market. Consequently, price increases are being provoked. Consequently, political chaos is being provoked in those countries that are most dependent on our exports. I am grateful to the Indonesians for understanding the arguments of our country and for their support in countering crises Russia is provoking. I talked to Stanford University students today. It is one of the world's leading universities. It was nice to see Ukrainian students studying there. It was also gratifying to hear how sincerely and fully the American student community is aware that we in Ukraine are fighting for our common freedom - one for all in the world. I invited Stanford students to join the implementation of the project of reconstruction of Ukraine after graduation. Because this will really be the biggest project of protecting freedom for their generation. I spoke today with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on how to prevent further development of the food crisis. And on the supply of fuel to Ukraine - this topic is a must in all my contacts with European partners. And on the defensive support for our state. Of course, the situation on the battlefield was discussed in detail. Difficult situation in Donbas. As expected, the situation is very difficult. The occupiers are trying to achieve in at least a hundred days of war the goals they hoped to achieve in the first days after February 24. Therefore, they concentrated maximum artillery, maximum reserves in Donbas. There are missile strikes and aircraft attacks - everything. We are protecting our land in the way that our current defense resources allow. We are doing everything to increase them. And we will increase them. If the occupiers think that Lyman or Severodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong. Donbas will be Ukrainian. Because this is us, this is our essence. And even if Russia brings destruction and suffering everywhere there, we will still rebuild every city and every community. And there is and will be no alternative to our Ukrainian flags there. As always, I signed a decree today to award our military. 198 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 4 of them posthumously. As well as 27 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate. Eternal glory to all who fight for our independence! Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 94th day of the full-scale war is over. The situation is very complicated. Especially in those areas in Donbas and the Kharkiv region, where the Russian army is trying to squeeze at least some result for themselves. The key areas of struggle at the front are still Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Popasna and other cities where the Russian offensive is concentrated. But our defense holds on. It's indescribably difficult there. And I am grateful to all those who withstand this onslaught of the occupiers. We work every day to strengthen our defense. This is primarily a supply of weapons. Every day we are bringing closer the time when our army will surpass the occupiers technologically and by firepower.  Of course, a lot depends on the partners. On their readiness to provide Ukraine with everything necessary to defend freedom. And I expect good news on this already next week. Today, the Russian army has launched absolutely senseless, openly barbaric strikes at the Sumy region. Missiles, mortars. And for what? And what does it give? Ukrainians of the Sumy region, as well as any other region of our state, have already understood everything about Russia. And it will not be able to add anything by the new terror. And even more so, it will not be able to intimidate. As a result of the Russian shelling of Mykolaiv today one person died, seven were wounded, two - in a grave condition. The shells hit a residential area, twenty meters from the kindergarten. These are the enemies chosen by the Russian Federation. Again and again I will remind the world that Russia must finally be officially recognized as a terrorist state, a state - sponsor of terrorism. This is simply true. This is fair and reflects the daily reality that the occupiers have created in Ukraine and are eager to bring further to Europe. And this must be legally enshrined. I am preparing for the meeting of the European Council, which will take place on May 30-31. I will address the participants of the meeting. In particular, I will talk about it. About terror, which has become in fact the only form of action of the Russian state in relation to Europe. Terror on the land of Ukraine. Terror in the energy market of Europe, not just our country. Terror in the food market, on a global scale. And what terror will be next? Only together - all Europeans - will we be able to stop such a policy of such a state. Of course, in my address to the European Council I will pay due attention to the progress in the development of our state, which has already been achieved and which can be achieved in the near future. I will also continue to address the parliaments of European countries next week. There will be many other international activities aimed at strengthening our state and increasing the joint pressure of the whole free world on Russia. I spoke today with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On defensive support and fuel supply to Ukraine. On how we can unblock Ukrainian ports, and therefore prevent the food crisis from unfolding. Security guarantees for Ukraine were also discussed separately, and we need to intensify work on them. There is more and more information that the occupiers are trying to limit the departure of our people from the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region. They do not provide any humanitarian corridors. And they have closed the individual departure of people. Those who are confident in their position would definitely not make such decisions. This is clearly a sign of weakness. Manifestation that they have nothing to give people. And people do not want to take anything from them. So they try to take people hostage. But Ukraine will return everything that belongs to it. Everything. Definitely. And it's only a matter of time. And every day this time, the time of liberation, is reduced. We do everything for this. Eternal gratitude and glory to all who defend our state! Eternal memory to everyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Strong people of our indomitable country! All our defenders! This address of mine is dedicated to four cities of Ukraine: Kharkiv, Kyiv, Severodonetsk and Kryvyi Rih. And through them - to our whole state, to all our cities and communities. Today I visited Kharkiv. Both the city itself and the frontline positions of our military in the region. Kharkiv suffered terrible blows from the occupiers. Black, burnt-out, half-ruined apartment buildings face east and north with their windows - from where Russian artillery was firing. From where Russian combat aircraft arrived. They face Russia. And in them now, like in a mirror, the Russian state can see itself. See how much it lost during these 95 days of full-scale war against Ukraine. Russia has already lost not only the battle for Kharkiv, not only the battle for Kyiv and the north of our country. It lost its own future and any cultural ties to the free world. They all burned down. In particular, there, in Saltivka. I held a meeting with the leadership of the region and the city. Thanked them for being and remaining together with the people of Kharkiv, together with Ukraine. And - what is very important now - together with each other. They have one hundred percent cooperation - the army, the police, the mayor of Kharkiv, the regional state administration - everyone really works for victory and does it very effectively. Unfortunately, this cannot be said about the local leadership of the Security Service of Ukraine. I arrived. Clarified the situation. Dismissed the head of the Security Service of the region. For not working to defend the city from the first days of a full-scale war, but thinking only of himself personally. What were the motives? Law enforcement officers will find out. One third of the Kharkiv region is still under occupation. We will definitely liberate the entire territory. And everyone should work for this result in positions both at the local level and at the state level. Before the trip, I signed a decree awarding our defenders. 222 combatants were awarded state awards. And during the trip today I had the honor to personally present some of the awards from this decree and others that were signed earlier. The post-war reconstruction of Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region was discussed very objectively with the local authorities. We must use only advanced ideas, only modern technologies in reconstruction. In particular, security technologies. And the best offers from our partners. Kharkiv and all other cities and communities in our country affected by the war must be reconstructed to have the most modern look in Europe. Returning from the east to Kyiv at this time leaves a rather ambiguous impression. After Saltivka's silence, there is Khreshchatyk, full of people and smiles. After the roar of artillery on the frontline - the relaxation of Kyiv residents who today walked the city. On the City Day, the Day of Kyiv, which is celebrated by thousands of people every year. But it is for such happiness to live, live your normal life and just quietly walk the streets of your own city that this war is going on now. That's what we are fighting for in it. For everyone in Ukraine. Freedom and peace is what could really be felt in Kyiv today. Even in spite of the air-raid siren that sounded today as well. So, I wish you, the people of Kyiv, to keep this peace - the peace of life. Take care of your city. And be sure to remember what it cost to defend the capital. Remember how many lives were given for the capital. I understand that in your eyes - it's summer already. I understand all this. But I want you to have an understanding - we still have to fight. The war is not over yet. Sophia and Lavra, Andriivskyi, Podil, Volodymyrska, Reytarska, Lypky and Khreshchatyk... I am grateful to everyone who made sure that the occupiers would never have a place here in Kyiv again. And I am very much looking forward to the day when I will be able to say similar words to another of our cities. A city that should celebrate its Day today in the same way as Kyiv. But... Russia came too close to it. It gathered too many forces in our Donbas. It was too prepared for the offensive there. I consider it very symbolic that the Russian military began the attempt to capture Severodonetsk by entering a hotel called “Myr” (Peace - ed.). Peace is indeed Russia's first target. Having taken away our peace in 2014, the occupiers want to take away everything else. Literally everything. They want to leave us neither freedom, nor houses, nor life. As a result of the Russian strikes at Severodonetsk, the entire critical infrastructure of the city has already been destroyed. 90% of houses are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city's housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no mobile connection. Constant shelling. Capturing Severodonetsk is a fundamental task for the occupying contingent. And they don't care how many lives they will have to pay for this attempt to raise the Russian flag on 32 Druzhby Narodiv boulevard (Friendship of Nations - ed.) - no matter how bitter the name sounds now - where the Severodonetsk administration is located. We are doing everything to repel this offensive. There was not a day that we did not try to find more weapons, more modern weapons to defend our land, to defend our people. And I am grateful to everyone who defends Severodonetsk and demonstrates to the occupiers that peace will still be ours. In all our state, in all Donbas and of course - in Severodonetsk. And another city I want to address today. For me, of course, the city is special. My native Kryvyi (Kryvyi Rih - ed.) also celebrates its birthday today. Already 247th. It would celebrate. But the time is not appropriate. The conditions are not appropriate. And the enemy is still on our land. The time to celebrate will be after our victory. And it will come. And today I want to wish just that - to my hometown and to all cities and communities of our great country. A shorter time to victory. We must all work for this - each and every one without exception. In my inaugural speech three years ago, I said that each of us is a president. And right now it is felt the most. Because our future depends not only on my actions in this office, the office of the President of Ukraine, or on what is being done in other offices in Kyiv. But also on what is being done in Kharkiv, Sumy, Kryvyi Rih and Odesa, Lviv and Uzhhorod, Lutsk and Vinnytsia, Mykolaiv and Dnipro, Zhytomyr and Chernihiv, Poltava and Kropyvnytskyi, Chernivtsi, Frankivsk, Ternopil, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy. Of course, in Kherson, in the Zaporizhzhia region, and in all territories of our Donbas and Crimea. The unity I saw with my own eyes today in Kharkiv. The heroism our soldiers in Donbas show every day. The determination of Kryvyi Rih. This is our path. The path to ensure that the peace of life is always felt throughout Ukraine and that smiles always reign, not the roar of artillery. Eternal glory to all who defend our state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President Michel. Dear Mrs. President Roberta. Dear friends! I am glad to be able to address all of you without exception. Today is the 96th day of Russia's full-scale war against our state, against all of us and against all of you. Against European unity. Russia wants to see at such meetings not a united European Council that we see now, not a united European Union, but 27 separate states, 27 fragments that cannot be put together. This is their wish. This policy of the aggressor is consistent, and there is no delay in it. Unlike Europe, Russia does not need to hold such summits and seek compromises for weeks. By the way, I want to thank you for talking about these compromises, for striving to find help and support for Ukraine. So, they are not ready to compromise, choosing what to do to achieve their goals. And now we see how the Russian offensive in Donbas is destroying our cities, destroying the communities of Ukraine, and at the same time how the European unity, the desired European unity may falter. On April 8, the 44th day of the war, the EU's fifth sanctions package was imposed. And 52 days have passed since then. What happened during this period? At that time, as of April 8, there were 169 children on the list of those killed by the Russian occupiers in Ukraine. As of today 243 children are on the list. At that time, as of April 8, 928 educational institutions were destroyed. Kindergartens, schools, universities. As of today – 1888. According to the information for the past day, the number of Russian missile strikes at Ukraine is already almost 1,600. Russia has used more than 2,400, almost 2,500 different missiles against us, against the civilian population. And then, as of April 8, there were less than a thousand strikes and they used about a thousand missiles. This is the progress of their aggression. And, of course, I want you to understand me - I'm not blaming any of you. It is only the Russian state that is to blame for everything that is happening. But I am convinced that it is obvious to each and every one of you that there should be progress in sanctions for this aggression. And for us it is crucial. And it will help us a lot! The progress that makes Russia begin to seek peace. And only this can be our common demand. Peace. There can be no compromises at the expense of our territorial integrity, our sovereignty! I am grateful to everyone who promotes the sixth sanctions package and tries to make it effective. However, unfortunately, for some reason it is not there yet. And why do you depend on Russia, on their pressure, not vice versa? Russia must depend on you. Why can Russia still earn almost a billion euros a day by selling energy resources? Why are banks of a terrorist state still working with Europe and the global financial system? Serious questions. And why are Russian propaganda channels still active in the European Union? This is an information weapon of the Russian Federation. Why are Russian civil servants who support the war and judges who openly support repression still not under sanctions? Each of these important questions is not just about sanctions packages or the war in Ukraine. All this is about us. All this is about Europe itself. Dear friends! Ladies and Gentlemen! Only through greater unity can we find effective responses to everything that Russia is doing against us and against you. If someone torpedoes a ship, one or more cabins cannot hope to stay afloat when others drown. You can see that the consequences of Russia's aggression have gone beyond our continent. And they will definitely return with even bigger problems for the whole of Europe. For example, large-scale famine in Africa and Asia will mean a threat of a new large-scale migrant crisis for southern and south-eastern Europe. And when you hear food blackmail from Moscow, please know that this is their deliberate strike at your societies. To ensure this strike, Russia simply uses the people of Africa and Asia as hostages, deliberately pushing them to starvation. So that people from there flee to you en masse. Are you ready for this? I don’t think so. Let's take a look at price instability in the energy market. It's not just some of the usual market fluctuations periodically observed. Last year, Russia created conditions for the record increase in gas prices. Now, investing in instability, Russia is making all energy prices skyrocket. For what? For Europeans to protest, not against the aggressor and their aggression, but against their own states. Against you personally. Against their leadership. And if this is a threat to each and every one of you, if this is Russia's bet on political chaos in your countries, why do some people still think they can defend themselves alone? Europe must show strength. Because Russia perceives only strength as an argument. It's time. It’s time for you to be not separate, not fragments, but one whole. Ukraine has shown by its own example why this is important. Why it's important to be united. In our country, starting from February 24 there is the maximum unity, everyone is working for one result - state protection. And thanks to this we managed to do what the world did not expect, Russia did not expect - Ukraine stopped their army, and everyone was afraid of it, everyone remembers. And we managed to liberate part of our occupied territory. Greater unity is truly the foundation of this strength. You know this. Finally, all quarrels in Europe must end, internal discord that only encourages Russia to put more and more pressure on you, on the whole of Europe. The sixth sanctions package must be agreed upon. It must be effective - including oil. So that Russia feels the price of what it is doing against Ukraine and against the whole of Europe. And for you and us to finally become independent from Russian energy weapons. At least from its oil part. And we must immediately find a solution that will prevent the food crisis from unfolding. Of course, I thank you for your efforts together with partners to create green corridors for agricultural exports from Ukraine. But still, you understand that a reliable guarantee of food security is impossible without ending Russia's war against Ukraine on our land. Because there can be no peaceful trade, no steady agricultural production, if Russia retains the ability to intercept ships with Ukrainian agricultural products. And not only in the Black Sea. Or to strike at our cities, ports, elevators, other infrastructure. Mr. President Michel! You were recently in Odesa and were forced to go into a shelter due to a missile attack. Mr. President has felt for himself what I am talking about now. And if this was felt even at such level, why is Russia still not recognized as a terrorist state, a state - sponsor of terrorism? And another aspect. The European home was never complete without Ukraine. It won’t be. There will never be a full-fledged European power without Ukraine. The very fact that Ukraine remained a fragment of Europe, somewhere outside your countries, contributed to the fact that Russia has developed an aggressive appetite to seize its neighbors. Only the enlargement and strengthening of European unity can prevent the recurrence of what Europe experienced on February 24, in 2014, and even in 1968 or 1956. Therefore - at the strategic level - the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union for Ukraine should be approved already in June. I would like to express gratitude to the countries of the Western Balkans for their understanding and support for granting candidate status to our country. Thank you very much. On April 8, when the fifth sanctions package was approved, we also received a questionnaire from the European Union. And we have already answered it over this time. We have already provided these answers to the European Commission. Unprecedentedly fast, and most importantly - in a coordinated manner. We expect the same reaction from Europe. And we reject any attempt to find an alternative that no one needs, or to find something else for Ukraine. We need to be like you. We want Ukraine to receive candidate status. We have met all the necessary criteria for this status. And I am sure that those individual states that are still hesitant about us, you know it well, will change their minds and show our united strength. The strength of our nations who support our membership in the European Union by an unprecedented majority. The strength of your nations, the strength of your states and a united Europe. I want to thank you for your unity, ability to be united, energetic, to have a future in a strong European Union and to ensure that the developments in the world depend on us. So that we depend on ourselves, not on some offices somewhere in Moscow. Right now you can determine whether everything that the European Union says about itself is true. About unity in diversity, common values and the same approach to all European democracies. We need a common customs space that will strengthen both Ukraine and all those involved in trade with us. We need a common payment space that will accelerate integration at the level of ordinary people. And a common roaming space. It is very important for our displaced people, more than 5 million of them, not to experience discrimination. And, of course, further armed and financial support for Ukraine is absolutely necessary. Now our common freedom depends on our success on the battlefield, and your stability depends on our stability. And this is another reason to find and freeze, and then confiscate all Russian assets and allocate them for the reconstruction and compensation for the damage caused by the war. Dear colleagues! Dear friends! We have already started a conversation with most of you about rebuilding Ukraine. We are creating a large-scale recovery plan. The global United24 support project has been activated. The European Commission is also preparing a platform for reconstruction. I urge all of you to join these initiatives now. If rebuilding begins during the war and becomes truly pan-European, it will be one of the most convincing pieces of evidence for everyone and, of course, for Russia in particular, that Europeans are strong. And they will not allow any of the integral parts of Europe to be destroyed. Neither Ukraine nor any other part. And finally. A 9-year-old girl died today as a result of the Russian shelling of the Kherson region of Ukraine. Two more children were wounded: a 7-month-old baby and a 5-year-old girl. A normal person can’t just put up with it. With such crimes. Daily crimes. These are the deliberate killings by the Russian military of our civilians, our children. They know exactly who they are firing at. And I really count on your principledness and activity to bring to justice every Russian soldier who killed or tortured our people, and every commander who gave or condoned such orders. Europe can definitely do that. Let's do it! Because this is not just a question of the aggressor's responsibility for a particular war, but of protecting humanity as such. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today, one of the key tasks of the day was communication for the approval of the sixth package of sanctions by the European Union. The pause in agreeing on new sanctions in Europe has been too long. The fifth sanctions package was introduced on April 8. So, a lot of time has passed without strengthening European sanctions against Russia. I emphasized that this should finally be corrected - and corrected immediately - in my address to the leaders of European countries who gathered for a meeting of the European Council. In particular, to discuss this issue. I am grateful to Charles Michel, President of the European Council, for supporting the interests of Ukraine, the interests of the whole of Europe and for trying to find the necessary compromises as soon as possible so that the European Union's sixth sanctions package can be adopted. Russia must feel a much higher price for its aggression. The key point is, of course, the oil. I believe that Europe will have to give up Russian oil and oil products in any case. Because this is about the independence of Europeans themselves from Russian energy weapons. And the sooner this happens, the more complete the abandonment of Russian oil will be, the greater the benefit will be for Europe itself in the end. I also spoke today about strengthening sanctions with the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France. Catherine Colonna paid a visit to Kyiv. In addition to sanctions, we also discussed the issues of defense support for Ukraine, our European integration and the need to act much faster to prevent the escalation of the food crisis in the world. Now, due to the fact that Russia has blocked our ports in the Black Sea and seized our part of the coast of the Sea of Azov, we cannot export 22 million tons of grain that are already in warehouses in our country. This is the volume that was to enter the foreign market. And Russia's blockade of our exports is destabilizing the situation on a global scale. As a result, food is becoming increasingly expensive in different countries. Consequently, there is a threat of famine. In Africa, in Asia, in some European countries. This threat could escalate into a new migrant crisis. And this is what the Russian leadership clearly wants. They are deliberately creating this problem. So that the whole of Europe faces difficulties. And so that Ukraine does not receive billions of dollars for its exports. These are the billions that our economy really needs now. And the inhabitants of African and Asian countries are used by the Russian state simply as a bargaining chip. Against this background, the stories of Russian officials at various levels that some sanctions allegedly do not allow them to increase exports of their food look particularly cynical. As if they allegedly want to prevent a crisis, but sanctions allegedly hinder them. It is clear that they are lying, as always. First, Russian food was not blocked by sanctions. And secondly, in our occupied territory, the Russian invaders have already stolen at least half a million tons of grain and are now looking for ways to illegally sell it somewhere. To sell it in a way to make money on what was stolen and to keep the deficit in the legal market. I spoke today with Turkish President Erdoğan, in particular, about this threat to food security. About how to ensure normal traffic from Ukrainian Black Sea ports. And, of course, about how to speed up the end of this war - Russia's war against our state. We also discussed further defense cooperation between Ukraine and Turkey. Today in the Luhansk region, the occupiers disrupted the evacuation from the areas of hostilities by firing at a car following the locals. French journalist Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff was killed by the shelling. He worked for the French TV channel BFM TV. A little over a month ago, I gave an interview to this particular TV channel. This was my first interview with the French media during a full-scale war. My sincere condolences to Frédéric's colleagues and family. He became the 32nd media representative killed after February 24. The situation in Donbas remains extremely difficult. The Russian army is trying to gather overwhelming forces in certain areas to put more and more pressure on our defenders. There, in Donbas, the maximum combat power of the Russian army is now gathered. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Kurakhove, Slovyansk and some other settlements remain key targets for the occupiers in this direction. And I am grateful to all our defenders who, despite the technical and sometimes quantitative advantage of the occupiers, heroically hold the defense. Today, Russian troops shelled Kharkiv again. The territory of our Sumy region was also shelled across the border between Ukraine and Russia. The struggle for the Kherson region continues. Step by step, we are liberating our land and gradually approaching the point where Russia will have to lay down its arms, count all its dead and move to diplomacy. Definitely have to. Eternal glory to everyone who defends the independence of Ukraine! Eternal memory to all who died at the hands of the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Finally, we have the specifics about the European Union's sixth sanctions package on Russia for this war. The package was agreed. Its approval and entry into force will take some time. But the key elements of the package are already clear, and most importantly - its direction. European countries have agreed to significantly limit oil imports from Russia. And I am grateful to everyone who worked to reach this agreement. The practical result is minus tens of billions of euros, which Russia will now be unable to use to finance terror. But it is also important to understand that European countries' abandonment of Russian oil and other fossil fuels will accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources. Strategically, this leaves the Russian state on the sidelines of the modern economy. With such an aggressive policy and a course of isolation from the civilized world, Russia simply will not be able to adapt. So, it will lose. Lose economically. We are also looking forward to the disconnection of one of the largest Russian banks - Sberbank - from SWIFT within the sixth sanctions package. Finally, there is the cessation of broadcasting of Russian disinformation channels in Europe. And new personal sanctions. We will also work on new restrictions against Russia for this war. As soon as the sixth package starts working, we will start preparing the seventh. After all, there must be no significant economic relations of the free word with the terrorist state. I discussed further sanctions policy of the European Union with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová. I am grateful to her, a true friend of Ukraine, for today's visit to Kyiv, for substantive negotiations and for an inspiring speech in the Verkhovna Rada. From the first days of the full-scale war, Slovakia has become one of our most important defense partners. And we will continue this cooperation. We also talked today about Ukraine's European movement. Mrs. Zuzana personally helps accelerate the integration of our state. And we will always be grateful for that. We are also preparing solutions for more effective management of processes at the borders of our states. In particular, joint customs control. At the beginning of her visit to Ukraine, the President of Slovakia visited Irpin and Borodyanka and saw with her own eyes the destruction caused by the Russian army. Anyone who sees this for themselves no longer needs to be persuaded why Russia must bear maximum responsibility for this war. I believe that Slovakia will provide all the necessary assistance to bring to justice all Russian war criminals and to rebuild everything they destroyed after the war. Today I would also like to address those in Ukraine who are trying, so to speak, to \"hurry up\" the Armed Forces of our state or to indicate how to attack and where to repel enemies in the first place. Ukraine values every opinion. But Ukraine values every life first and foremost. And this is an axiom. And Ukraine will never do like Russia, which throws people into hell of battles just because Moscow wanted to seize something in a few days or by a certain date. Our military, intelligence, the National Guard and all those involved in the defense of the state are gradually but inevitably thwarting all the plans of the occupiers. The frontline situation must be assessed comprehensively. Not by one area, where there is the most tough situation and which attracts the most attention, but by the whole frontline. The situation in the Donbas direction is very difficult. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Kurakhove are now at the epicenter of the confrontation. Given the presence of large-scale chemical production in Severodonetsk, the Russian army's strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just madness. But on the 97th day of such a war, it is no longer surprising that for the Russian military, for Russian commanders, for Russian soldiers, any madness is absolutely acceptable. We have certain success in the Kherson direction, as well as an advancement in the Kharkiv region. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are rebuffing the pressure of the occupiers in the Zaporizhzhia region, the key direction is Hulyaipole and Orikhiv. In this broad picture, it must be seen that our defenders are showing the utmost courage and remain masters of the frontline situation, despite the fact that the Russian army still has a significant advantage in equipment and numbers. Of course, everyone in Ukraine wants all our territories, all our people to be liberated today, as soon as possible. The full restoration of the territorial integrity of our state is our goal. But we must act carefully, valuing life. Everyone at all levels must now be lobbyists for the supply of modern heavy weapons and modern artillery to our state. All those systems that can really speed up the victory of Ukraine. Talk about it wherever it is useful and wherever it is heard. Speak to the politicians of the partner countries, to the representatives of foreign media, even to your friends abroad. This narrative of the need to provide Ukraine with enough weapons to win must be maintained constantly. I work for this every day. I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 215 combatants were awarded state awards, 17 of them - posthumously. Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who are fighting for our independence! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Defenders! Every year on June 1 we celebrate Children's Day. A special day when adults pay special attention to the rights of children, safety and development of our kids. But since February 24, everything has changed in our country. And literally every day now is a day of protection for us. Protection of all our people, children, our future. Protection of a free country where every child can, when he or she grows up, live the life he or she wants. Without coercion and oppression. Everyone sees what Russia brings to Ukraine and what it wants to bring to other European countries. Total contempt for individuals, for entire nations. The Russian state despises even its own citizens so much that they do not understand the value of human life at all. Russian soldiers kill and die themselves as if they were not people, but just dust. Dust under the feet of the owners of Russia. The principles of our life are completely different. And although life has changed with the onset of wartime, our principles remain the same. Every person matters. This is the main thing that distinguishes us from the occupiers. During the 98 days of the Russian invasion, 689 children were injured as a result of the occupiers' attacks. And these are only those we know about. We do not yet have all the information from the territory that is currently occupied. But from what is known today - 446 children were injured, 243 children died. 139 went missing. It is said that human consciousness does not perceive large numbers. The larger the number, the harder it is for a person to realize what is behind it. Destroyed families. Little personalities who did not even have time to see what life is like. Like little Denys from the Zhytomyr region, from the village of Malynivka, who died with his whole family when a Russian plane dropped bombs on the village. Denys was less than two years old. Like Stepan from the village of Novi Petrivtsi, Kyiv region. He was less than three years old when a Russian shell hit the yard. The kid was fatally wounded. Like Anya from Bucha, Kyiv region, she was 14 years old. She was killed when the Russian military fired at a minibus on the road. People were just trying to escape. Anya was in that car with her mother and grandmother. They all died. Polina, she was not even two years old. A Russian tank fired at a house in Borodyanka. An ordinary house. Direct hit. Polina died. Arina, Mykolaiv region. On March 5, she received shrapnel wounds as a result of artillery shelling, the occupiers hit the usual residential sector. She died at the hospital. Now, in June, Arina could be 4 years old. Svyatoslav from Odesa, he was 15 years old. He was killed by a Russian missile strike at a dormitory. It happened on May 2. His body was retrieved from the rubble of the house. Alisa from Okhtyrka, Sumy region. 7-year-old kid. She died on the second day of a full-scale war as a result of Russian artillery shelling. The occupiers simply fired at the houses. Mykyta from the city of Izyum, Kharkiv region. He was 3 years old. On the night of March 3, he was killed by a Russian air strike at the city. A total of nine people died that night. Two sisters - Varvara and Polina from Mariupol. Varvara was 14 years old and Polina was 11. They died as a result of the Russian shelling of an apartment building. I have named only ten children from the list of two hundred and forty-three. And it's not just numbers. Each line is a separate world that was destroyed by the Russian army. In this list there are those about whom nothing is known at all, even the name... 243 children! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken away by the Russian war against us, against Ukrainians, against Ukraine. About 12 million of our citizens have been forced to flee their homes due to the war. More than 5 million went abroad. And the vast majority of them are women with children. We will do everything so that they can return home to Ukraine. Russia is also pursuing a consistent criminal policy of deporting our people. Forcibly deports both adults and children. This is one of Russia's most heinous war crimes. In total, more than 200,000 Ukrainian children have been deported so far. These are orphans from orphanages. Children with parents. Children separated from their families. The Russian state disperses these people on its territory, settles our citizens, in particular, in remote regions. The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people, but to make deportees forget about Ukraine and not be able to return. But we must find a solution to this challenge as well. And ensure that all those who killed, tortured or deported Ukrainians are held accountable. The inevitability of punishment is a principle that Ukraine will definitely teach Russia. But first of all, we must teach it on the battlefield that Ukraine will not be conquered, that our people will not surrender, and our children will not become the property of the occupiers. Today I signed two new decrees on awarding our heroes. 380 combatants were awarded. In total, since the beginning of the full-scale war, 17 thousand 86 defenders of Ukraine have received orders and other awards. Thanks to all those who defend our state, our people, our children, we can be sure that Ukraine has everything, and has a future. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, members of the government, everyone present! Dear people of Luxembourg! Thank you for the opportunity to contact you. Your state has a wise and extremely relevant motto: \"We want to stay what we are.\" And this is now perceived in a special way. You cannot pass by these words. Because what are we fighting for? For what we are. And to stay what we are. Free, independent, open and united with all Europeans. We have been fighting for this right, this aspiration for a very long time. Much longer than Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. By the way, tomorrow is the hundredth day of this war. And when this characteristic is used - full-scale - it is usually just a rhetorical separation of the ongoing war from the war that Russia started in 2014. Then, 8 years ago, the Russian army invaded our land and occupied part of it for the first time. The Crimean peninsula and a third of Donbas, including the largest cities, Donetsk and Luhansk. The fighting in Donbas lasted for 8 years. There were very hot and bloody phases of confrontation. There were also short periods of ceasefire, which cost many great diplomatic efforts. Ukraine has lost more than 14,000 people killed - from 2014 to February 24 this year. More than one and a half million people have become internally displaced persons. As a result of the then campaign of invasion, the Russian army controlled more than 43,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory. This area is comparable, for example, to the area of the Netherlands. And for most European countries, such a scale of war would be enormous already. But on February 24, Russia showed that it was not a scale at all for it. It showed that its cruelty is much greater. Russian troops entered 3,620 settlements in Ukraine. 1,017 of them have already been liberated. Another 2,603 are to be released. As of today, about 20 percent of our territory is under the control of the occupiers. Almost 125 thousand square kilometers. This is much larger than the area of all the Benelux Countries combined. About 300 thousand square kilometers are bestrewn with mines and unexploded ordnance. Almost 12 million Ukrainians have become internally displaced persons. More than 5 million, mostly women and children, have gone abroad. Fighting continues on the huge territory from the city of Kharkiv in the east of our country to the city of Mykolaiv in the south. A straight line between them is 454 kilometers long. But if you look at the entire frontline, and it is, of course, not straight, this line is more than a thousand kilometers. Just imagine! Constant fighting, which stretched along the frontline for more than a thousand kilometers. Every day Ukraine suffers from Russian missile strikes. Just yesterday, Russia used 15 different cruise missiles. And since February 24, 2,478 missiles have been used. Most of them were aimed at civil infrastructure. We have to defend ourselves against virtually the entire Russian army. All combat-ready Russian military units are involved in this aggression. The occupiers’ death toll is already more than 30,000 soldiers. That's greater than the death toll of the Soviet Union in 10 years of war in Afghanistan. Greater than Russia’s death toll in two Chechen wars. But this does not stop Russia. This state is still ready to lose and kill, kill people. Because only one person in Russia doesn’t want to let us stay what we are. The Russian army has already destroyed almost the entire Donbas. This once one of the most powerful industrial centers in Europe is simply devastated. The occupiers are destroying it city after city. Just look at the city of Mariupol. There were half a million people, ordinary peaceful life in an important industrial city. Now there are burnt out ruins. And we still don't even know exactly how many of our people were killed by the occupiers. At least tens of thousands - tens of thousands in a little less than 100 days. This is what it means, in fact, to characterize this war as full-scale. And that is why we are so loud urging the world to support us. First of all, calling for defense support. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine has shown extraordinary bravery. We did not surrender to Russia. We have stopped and are gradually pushing the army of invaders, which was recently considered the second strongest in the world, out of our territory. Nobody expected Ukrainians to have courage of this magnitude. But this magnitude is there. And this quality of our character, our willingness to fight for freedom and for our values - and these are the common values of all free Europeans - is now based on the support we have received from our partners. I am very grateful to you, the authorities and the people of Luxembourg, for the historic decision to provide Ukraine with weapons. Unlike other states, Luxembourg does not have large military depots or significant defense industry. But you have shown solidarity on the scale of a great nation and provided defense assistance in a timely manner - how important it is - and without excessive bureaucracy, as befits people with a great soul. You have proven that your potential is stronger than that of some who have remained weak even despite a much larger geographical scale. I am also grateful to you for participating in the sanctions pressure on Russia. Only together can all democracies ensure that Russia is satisfied with the scale of its own territory and never encroaches on the lives of other countries. We understand that no one will be able to stay away and avoid being affected when a catastrophe of such enormity occurs in the world because of the Russian state. It is reminiscent of World War II, when Nazi aggression threatened the lives of entire nations. Therefore, we must significantly increase the pressure on Russia to stop this catastrophe and prevent such aggressions in the future. We need more weapons for Ukraine - modern weapons that will ensure the superiority of our state over Russia in this war not only through courage, intelligence, but also technologically. And I ask you to advocate this need before other European states. More sanctions on Russia are needed for the war. As soon as the sixth sanction package is imposed, we should all prepare the seventh. All Russian officials working for the war and all Russian judges working for repression must be subject to the sanctions. The assets of these and other persons, both individuals and legal entities, subject to sanctions, as well as the assets of the Russian state in foreign jurisdictions must be frozen. All of them. And we need to find a legal way to confiscate them in order to compensate for the damage that Russia has done to the victims of the war. That will be fair. And - instructive for the aggressor. We must show that European unity outweighs any doubt about Europe's ability to defend its values. Ukraine has de facto become part of the European Union. We are already cooperating both bilaterally and at the EU level on a scale commensurate with full membership. What can prove this better than the fact that we protect each other? And I believe that your country - as one of the founders of a united Europe - will support first the candidacy for Ukraine, and later the membership in the European Union. I am sure that your specialists and companies will join the project of reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. And this will be the largest economic project in Europe of our generation. Luxembourg's investment and technological potential and ability to organize a comfortable city life are well known. And I believe that we will see how your potential will work in Ukraine for the benefit of both our nations. Mr. Prime Minister! I invite you to visit our capital, Kyiv, so that we can discuss our further cooperation in detail. We will be glad to hear your speech in our parliament - in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! I want to recall these words again: \"We want to stay what we are.\" Right now, Russia's war against Ukraine is crucial for the whole of Europe as well. This is a war for values. When we win this war, all Europeans will be able to continue to enjoy their freedom. But if the person who wants to destroy any freedom in Ukraine and Europe prevails, there will be a dark time for everyone on the continent. One that has already been in the history of Europe, which has brought the continent a lot of suffering and victims. And an echo of which can still be heard sometimes today, unfortunately, in the voices of those who are trying to undermine European unity. Tyranny must lose. So that Europe can stay what it is. What it is now. Free, open, united and able to be strong in diversity. And I am grateful to you for the fact that the Grand Duchy is truly defending freedom with us. Thank you all! Thank you Luxembourg! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good afternoon! Thank you very much for this opportunity! Mrs. President Čaputová! Mrs. President von der Leyen! Mr. Prime Minister Heger! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear friends! Thank you for the honor of speaking to you today. This year, for the first time in its history, the Bratislava Forum is organized in such a way that its panels will be held not only on land, but also on water. On a ship on the Danube. And it seems to me that this image is important. Because today discussing the challenges to European security and stability, the threats to all humanity in a comprehensive way is simply impossible without taking into account everything that is happening on water. One of the most important targets for the Russian army in Ukraine today is bridges across rivers. There are occasions when the Russian army strikes missiles three times at the same bridge to completely destroy it. It is impossible to overestimate the threat that Russian aggression has created for the water potential of our entire part of Europe - the center and east, the Black Sea basin. The nature of the fighting of the Russian army is frankly barbaric. They just destroy absolutely everything. Both residential buildings and industrial enterprises are being brutally bombed. In particular, environmentally hazardous chemical plants, metallurgical plants, etc. Fighting in Donbas has created a threat of groundwater pollution since 2014. If the flooding of coal mines in Donbas continues - among them, for example, the Yunkom mine, where an underground nuclear explosion took place in 1979 - poison and even radioactive contamination can get not only into the rivers of Ukraine, but also into the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Of course, speaking about the security challenges associated with our waters - the waters of rivers, the waters of the seas, it is impossible to avoid the blockade of Ukrainian ports by the Russian Federation. Because of this act of aggression by the Russian state, the world is on the brink of a food crisis. And it's not just a food problem. This is a shortage in the market. This is a catastrophic rise in prices for basic products. This is a threat of hunger for tens of millions of people in different countries. If this is not prevented, we will get the problem of political chaos in some countries in Africa and Asia. Consequently, the migrant crisis in Europe, when people from countries suffering from hunger will seek salvation. Also, the food crisis will inevitably lead to large-scale protests in European countries. Many governments will have to explain to protesters on the streets of various European cities why our continent has been taken hostage by one state - Russia - and one person - in Moscow - who ordered the naval blockade of Ukraine. And now I have mentioned only a few consequences and only in one area of many in which we have extreme threats. Extraordinary challenges. How should we respond to all this? Ladies and Gentlemen! Let's remember the Danube River again. It equally enriches different nations and different cities. Bratislava, Vienna, Budapest, Linz, Regensburg, Belgrade, Izmail and others. Slovakia, Austria, Germany, Romania, Serbia, Hungary, Moldova and Ukraine. For the Danube to remain clean and safe, for its economic potential, including transport, to work in full, the cooperation of all countries to which nature has given this river is needed. Therefore, unity is needed. Mutual understanding is needed. We need the ability to speak and negotiate for the common good. And these, by the way, are the key things for a peaceful and free life in Europe. This is what Slovakia can do. This is what Ukraine can do. This is what other partner states can do. And this is what Russia deliberately ignores. Does it try to hear someone? Understand? No. Does Russia recognize common interests? No. It sees only its own, and treats them quite specifically. Not as the interests of the entire Russian people, but as the selfish desires of a handful of state owners. And how does Russia perceive the very concept of unity? Only as an attempt to subdue others, to make them dependent on it, to destroy their identity. This is how they interpret unity - when the other and any diversity is simply destroyed. And this is exactly what they are doing on the territory of Ukraine. They are trying not just to kill people, but to erase the very fact that there is our state, that there is Ukraine. And that Ukraine seeks to be a full-fledged part of a united Europe. This is an openly anti-European policy of Russia. And such a policy obliges Europe to react, to react in a principled manner. First, to support Ukraine even more actively. With weapons, finances, politically. We are grateful for the help we already receive. To everyone who helps us. But arms supplies need to be increased. Because it is on the battlefield in Ukraine that it is decided whether freedom in Europe will be preserved for all nations without exception. And right now on the battlefield in Ukraine is a situation that could provide a turning point in the confrontation. Right now, these days, when Russia will lose the war against Ukraine, the freedom of Europeans will win for decades to come. Secondly, these are sanctions. The main purpose of the European Union's sanctions packages is not just to harm Russia, but to make Europe independent of Russia, to sever all critical ties between Russia and European countries that Moscow uses as a weapon, including the energy one. That is why I consider it unacceptable when so much time is spent discussing the sanctions package, in particular the sixth one. These are all our people, these are all our days. More than a month! Of course, it is good that the sixth sanctions package has finally been agreed. But it must start working immediately so that it is possible to move on to the preparation of the seventh sanctions package. Every remaining link between Europe and Russia is a rope that the Russian state will try to turn into a stranglehold. Thirdly, we must strengthen the unity of Europe, true unity. And the main step in this direction should be to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union, and subsequently full membership. There can be no temptation in Russia to assume that European countries will not support Ukraine in this matter. Because if Russia feels that Europe is weak and can leave Ukraine without the obviously necessary decision on candidacy, it will be one of the biggest destabilizing factors for the continent during Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! We must respond to all the challenges and dangers that the Russian Federation has created against us. Politics, economics, military sphere, food, environment, migration - there is no area of our lives in which there is no catastrophe, crisis or threat of catastrophe or crisis due to Russia's actions. The quality of our answers directly depends on only one thing - our unity. Any division in Europe is a chance, a chance for Russia. For it to continue its aggressive policy. I believe you are aware of this. So, I believe that we will be able to protect our continent and our people from everything that threatens us today. But we also have to think about tomorrow. About what will happen after the victory, together with you, we believe in our common victory over tyranny. That is why Ukraine is already working on a large-scale United 24 initiative. It is a system of tools that can, when fully built, protect not only our state, but also other nations from the threat of armed aggression, natural disasters and anything that can destroy lives. We aim to make sure that every state that needs help can receive it in 24 hours. Unfortunately, there is no such tool in the world today. Although it is obvious that there is a need for it. So, I urge you to familiarize yourself with how the first element of this future infrastructure works. Fundraising platform that allows you to accumulate funds from different sources for different needs, including defense, infrastructure, medical, social. Anyone without any bureaucracy can decide for themselves how to help a state in need. Gradually, we will add other tools to United 24. Diplomatic instruments, sanctions, technical tools - together with you. They will significantly upgrade the existing global security architecture. I am sure that the need to update it will also be one of the key topics of your discussions. So, pay attention to the Ukrainian proposals. And do not forget that the state, for which anything is a weapon or a way to aggression, is trying to destroy us all. Including your peaceful and beautiful Danube. Defend us! Defend yourself! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! We have three important pieces of news. First, the European Union is gradually moving towards the implementation of the sixth sanctions package. Frankly, achieving this is very difficult. Because this sanctions package is primarily about oil. Finally, the world is giving up Russian oil. Moreover, other countries, which produce much better and lighter oil, are preparing to replace Russian supplies. Therefore, huge revenues are lost for the aggressor state in this sphere. Of course, Russia is constantly trying to counter this. It has long enjoyed the flow of petrodollars and does not want to be weaned off it. But it has to. It has to get used to the fact that a very painful reduction in income is an inevitable consequence of the war for its culprit, for the Russian state. The second piece of news is that the United States has confirmed at various levels that modern HIMARS are being sent to our country. These weapons will really help save the lives of our people and protect our land. I am grateful to President Biden, all our American friends, and the people of the United States for their support. We are looking forward to it. We also expect good news about the supply of weapons from other partners. For example, today we have a new package of defense aid from Sweden. I am very grateful to the leadership of this state. We are working to bring the supply of modern combat systems to a much higher level. Third, more and more embassies resume their full-fledged activities in Kyiv. As of today, there are already 50 of them. This is very important not only in practice - for the work of diplomats, but also on a symbolic level. Every new embassy that returns to our capital is a testament to the faith in our victory. Faith that Ukraine will be able to defend its statehood in this war unleashed on our land by the Russian Federation. A new and, I think, very important and beautiful tradition was launched today. From now on, the ceremony of presenting credentials by ambassadors of foreign countries who start their mission in Ukraine will take place not just in Kyiv, but on the territory of our St. Sophia Cathedral. And the first ambassadors that presented credentials today in such a new ceremony were the ambassadors of Moldova, India and the United States. Why there? Why in Sophia? Because it is the sacred, historical and statehood center of our people. Receiving the credentials of the ambassadors there, we demonstrate who the Ukrainians are, what we are and what is behind us. We hereby express our highest respect to the representatives of other nations. We open up to them. And at the same time we show that we expect from them the same respect, the same sincerity to the Ukrainian people, to our interests and to our history. Immediately after the ceremony, I spoke with the new ambassadors. Impressions are good. I hope for productive work. Today there were two important addresses: to the Luxembourg Parliament and to the participants of the Security Forum in Bratislava, which was attended by President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and other friends and partners of our country. Of course, the key task is still to accumulate maximum support for Ukraine. First of all defensive, financial and, of course, political. Almost every address leads to increased assistance to our state. It is very important that now - in a few weeks - we are waiting for the answer of the European Union on the issue of candidate status for Ukraine. We are very much looking forward to it. And I am grateful to all those who have already spoken in support of our state, in support of the candidacy. In particular, in response to my requests in appeals to the parliaments of different countries, forums, student and expert communities, people in the squares of various European cities who rallied in support of Ukraine, in support of our people. We must understand that Russia has now mobilized all its forces to thwart Ukraine's European movement. And every tool - especially public debates and appeals - must be fully used. The situation in Donbas has not changed significantly in a day. We had some success in the battles in Severodonetsk. But it's too early to tell. The situation there is the hardest now. Just as in the cities and communities nearby - Lysychansk, Bakhmut and others. Many cities are facing a powerful Russian attack. The Russian army uses all its armed capabilities and does not count people at all. It is especially cynical that in the first line of the offensive the occupiers very often use those people who were recruited into their army in the previously occupied territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russian soldiers often simply hide behind these so-called mobilized. The longer the war lasts, the more vile, shameful and cynical things Russia inscribes in its history forever. Absolutely senseless shelling of our border northern regions, in particular Chernihiv, continues from the Russian territory. Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, the Kharkiv region were shelled. The entire temporarily occupied territory of our state is now a zone of total catastrophe, for which Russia is fully responsible. We have already started working on new sanctions packages against Russia. Step by step, we will deprive the Russian state of all the elements of the modern economy. The occupiers will pay the full price for destroying the lives of neighbors. And no lobby in any country will help Russia. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our defenders, our heroes. 223 combatants were awarded state awards, 72 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to each of our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Great people of great Ukraine! Exactly one hundred days ago we all woke up in a different reality. Exactly one hundred days ago, different us woke up. When Ukrainians are awakened not by the sun's rays, but by the explosions of missiles that hit our homes, then completely different Ukrainians wake up. In 2014, Russia came to us with one word, with a new word. And this is the word \"war\". On February 24, Russia added another word to it, making the phrase \"full-scale war.\" And during a hundred days we found or received, saw or wanted to erase other words. There are few of them. They are different. But they reflect what we have experienced. Among these words are some new to us. And those that were forgotten by our parents, but that we had to recall. Well known to everyone on the planet. And those that all people have to remember with horror. Painful words. And those that really give us hope. All of them are important. It will be right to recall them all today. One hundred days - one hundred words. First of all, these are two words: \"our heroes\". First of all, people who have been defending our state since the night of February 24. And then - the Ukrainian words: \"palianytsia\", \"Armed Forces\", \"Stugna\", \"Cossack\", \"Zmiinyi\" and... Of course, \"Chornobaivka\" is a word that has sounded many times already and in which you can see everything about our resistance and about our enemies. And also - foreign words that have become native to Ukraine: \"Bayraktar\", \"Harpoon\", \"HIMARS\", \"Starlink\", \"Rzeszów\" and... Of course, \"Lend-Lease\" - another word, just one, but it reflects 100 days of struggle, 100 days of diplomacy, 100 days of support. And a word that reflects something important in our character. In the Ukrainian character. The “Javelins” that frightened the enemies because they did not expect the armor wouldn’t save them. And then caused a smile, our smile, when Ukrainians also painted \"Saint Javelin\". Well, the word to which everyone in Ukraine raises a toast - \"Neptune\". Every day we had words that are much more than just words for everyone now. Hard words. “Hostomel”, “Borodyanka”, “Okhtyrka”, “Chernihiv”, “Kharkiv”, “Kherson”, “Izyum”, “Melitopol”, “Mariupol” and “Azovstal”. And with them - \"army\", \"artillery\", \"Marines\", \"border guards\", \"intelligence\", \"National Guards\", \"police\", \"territorial defense\", \"aviation\", \"our heroic pilots\"... And also the word \"ghost\". The ghost of Kyiv. Who destroyed enemies and survived. We may not have heard all these words as many times in our lives as we have heard them in these hundred days. And every time we hear them, we know: they give us the time and opportunity to live as long as we are given. Given by God. Not by the enemy. \"God\" - this word, this appeal has been heard more than once. And always in a special way. There were also words that our enemy wanted to erase. \"Volnovakha\" and \"Saltivka\", \"Popasna\" and \"Severodonetsk\". These are words that we will definitely write again. But in our way. Just like \"Bucha\". Just like \"Mariupol\". And we will surely write them next to the word \"tribunal\". For other words - \"filtration\", \"deportation\", \"torture\", \"execution\", \"carpet bombing\", \"missile strike\" - to surely get an answer. Answer with just one word - \"justice\". Justice that will become a full stop after the temporary words for us \"occupation\", \"Mordor\", \"orcs\". Of course, they will leave our lexicon. We will definitely drive them out of our land. There were also words that gave hope and for which we fought particularly. \"Humanitarian corridors\", which have become a road of life for hundreds of thousands of people and made it possible to overcome another word, the terrible word \"blockade\". From the first day we have words the distance between which is as between darkness and light. We avoid one word. This word is “refugees”. And due to another word, we believe that millions of our people have a future. It will be at home, in Ukraine. This word is “displaced persons”. A lot has changed. When we hear the word \"Patron\", we remember the most famous sapper of Ukraine. And when we hear: “marathon”, we understand that it is not about sports at all. And of course, a lot of deadly words have been added to our lexicon. The words no Ukrainian ever wanted to see. And the words a normal person cannot be proud of. \"Iskander\", \"Kalibr\", \"Solntsepyok\", \"phosphorus bombs\" and more. For some reason we did not see their vaunted Armata tank. I think they were afraid of our new phrase: “tractor troops”. And one more phrase is worth mentioning: \"the second army of the world\". At first it looked threatening. Then it was dangerous. After Bucha - it caused disgust. And now - only a bitter smile. Because what's left of it? Of the army, which was called the second army in the world... War crimes, disgrace and hatred. And - numbers instead of words. When you see the number of killed every morning. The number of wounded. The number of shelling occasions. The number of missiles. When next to the word “children” there is a new number every morning. Today - 261. Already 261 children were killed by the Russian invasion. For what? There are no words that can answer this question. Words have appeared that are now very common. Which sound daily. But we must make sure that for our children they no longer mean what they mean to us today. So that they can perceive them only as history. First of all, it is the word \"ruins\". But also - siren, air alarm, curfew, checkpoint, barbed wire. And the word - mines. There will be many more words that everyone will know. Which will make sense for everyone. And which will give a chance to millions. These are the words - reconstruction, candidacy and membership, guarantees and security. And definitely the word \"return\". Of course, based on the word that was a dream, but will become a reality - \"liberation\". These are the words of our future! These are the words about what we will do to our red viburnum, to our glorious Ukraine. The words about where the enemy warship is heading and will always head. About what to do with the occupiers when someone says: \"Vova!\". And of course - our folklore already - \"Good evening! We are from Ukraine!\". From Ukraine, where the field is blooming, but her hair is getting gray. From Ukraine that stands and will stand. Ukraine, whose glory and freedom have not yet perished. Ukraine, to which we say - glory! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the nation! And everyone knows the next phrase: \"Death to the enemies!\" Because there are three words we have been fighting for for a hundred days already after eight years: peace, victory, Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Mayors of the United States of America! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today. The United States has become a true leader in Ukraine's international support. This is defense, financial and political support. And it is based on a sincere connection between all nations who equally value freedom. On the fact that we, Ukrainians and Americans, equally understand the dangers of tyranny. The world has seen various tyrannies. At different times. Under different flags. And all of them are united by the fact that they despise the rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Tyrants do not recognize the rights and freedoms of local government. And it is usually the free people in the cities which still choose freedom that put an end to the history of tyrants. And to put an end to this, tyrants must not be allowed to enjoy ties to the free world. Any ties. You know that dozens of American cities maintain the so-called \"brotherhood\" with the cities of the Russian Federation. Chicago and Moscow. Jacksonville and Murmansk. San Diego - Vladivostok. Albany and Tula. What do these connections give you? Probably nothing. But they give Russia the opportunity to say that it is not isolated, even after beginning such a war. Each of you sees how the Russian army wages war and what it is doing to the peaceful cities of Ukraine. Its cruelty is no different from the tyrannies of earlier times. Mariupol was a port city, an industrial center with half a million people. Russia simply destroyed it. There is nothing there but ruins. Just as the city of Volnovakha and dozens of other cities that the Russian army burns daily. Burns with bombs, missiles, artillery. Just imagine - since February 24, Russia has used almost 2,500 different missiles against Ukraine. The vast majority of them were aimed at cities. At city infrastructure. And some of the most deadly Russian missiles are designed and manufactured in Yekaterinburg. Which, by the way, is still a sister city of San Jose. I'm sure many of you have seen and heard what Russian soldiers did in our city of Bucha. Mass killings, torture of people. The bodies of the killed locals laid on the streets while Russian soldiers remained in the city. One of those Russian brigades that did all this against our people in Bucha was a brigade from the Khabarovsk Krai of Russia. And the capital of this region - the city of Khabarovsk is still a sister city of Portland. What for? I leave you this question. Now, in order to restore normal life in Bucha and in the Bucha community, almost 2,000 buildings need to be rebuilt. You understand better than anyone else what this means for any city, when 2,000 houses are destroyed or damaged by missiles and hostilities. These are ordinary houses, ordinary schools, sports facilities, medical institutions. In total, as of February 24, 3,620 settlements in Ukraine faced Russian occupation - both large cities and small towns. In each of them there is destruction. Many of them are simply not suitable for civilized life. This is the reality that Russia has brought. When there is no connection in cities, there is no electricity, there is simply no water. When bombs and missiles can destroy any building - even a kindergarten or university. When the whole city can just be burned. But I believe that Ukraine will be able to defend freedom, and tyranny will definitely lose. People will again be able to live peacefully and safely in Ukrainian cities. And to make it happen faster, we have planned an ambitious project to rebuild Ukraine after this war. I invite you - your cities, your companies, your business and professionals - to take part in this project. You can also become the people who choose to defend freedom and thus put an end to the history of tyranny. Thanks to the leadership of the United States and the support of all our partners, Ukraine's bravery receives the necessary weapons to fight for freedom. But the economic advantage of a free world must also be demonstrated. That is why we are already inviting our partners to join the reconstruction of Ukraine. Take patronage over a city, region, or industry that has been destroyed by Russian strikes. And rebuild them with the latest technology. This may be the largest economic project of our time, which will strengthen Ukraine, each country and each company that will participate in the post-war reconstruction. You can join the implementation of this great project. This will definitely mean economic growth, innovation and new social opportunities for both our country and your cities. Ladies and Gentlemen! The beginning of the annual Conference of Mayors of the United States this year coincided with the 100th day of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. There are many issues on your agenda that concern the internal life of your country, your cities and communities. But remember - the full-scale war in Europe and the destabilization of world markets, which occurred because of Russia, directly affect the lives of every nation and all cities of the free world. Therefore, call for even more pressure on Russia. Don't help it justify itself. Don't maintain ties with it. And please do not allow those who have become murderers to call you their brothers and sisters. Help Ukraine. Help even more. Participate in the reconstruction of our cities, our communities that are liberated from the occupiers. Thank you very much for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Greetings, Washington! Today is the hundredth day of Russia's full-scale war against us, against Ukraine. I want to tell you a story so that you understand what this war means to us. I want to tell you about Svitlana Klymenko, a nurse at a hospital in the town of Ivankiv near our capital. On February 24, the first day of Russian invasion, Svitlana lost her husband. He worked as a paramedic and went out on a call in the area where Russian troops tried to advance on Kyiv. Since then, the first day of the war, he has been regarded as missing.  The war also took away Svitlana's other closest person, her son. He perished in Mariupol. Svitlana spent over a month under occupation until her town Ivankiv was liberated from Russian occupiers. Despite the pain of loss, she didn’t give up. She was doing her job. Just her job. Throughout the occupation, she worked at Ivankiv hospital and helped to save people. When I met her recently, she told me that it had been this work that had helped her make it through this. Saving others became her own life’s purpose. Svitlana continues working to this day. Like thousands of doctors and nurses, who have been rescuing people since February 24: children, women, and the elderly, because Russia does not spare anyone.  We must do everything we can to support them. So that they have something and somewhere to treat patients and where to treat them as well as armored ambulances, safe from Russian troops, who are shooting them. The Russian army is ruthless. They are not only trying to kill as many people as possible but also to destroy all the infrastructure required for living. Bridges and roads, houses and hospitals, schools and factories. Burned-out cities, universities, and maternity hospitals, destroyed by missiles.  Ruins are all that is left behind by the Russians. But people need to have somewhere to return. Right now. Today. That is the reason I initiated the special United24 platform. It is not just fundraising. It is also one of the ways to prove to Russia that evil will not win. Thousands of wounded need help. Thousands of objects need to be restored. Ladies and gentlemen, you can join in.  How – is entirely up to you. Rebuild the bridge to Irpin, whose photos have attracted worldwide attention, or buy medical equipment that will help Svitlana Klymenko and her colleagues save many, many lives. Your help will be transferred fast and used as effectively and transparently as possible. We guarantee that thanks to these donations your names will forever go down in the history of Ukraine, the history of defending freedom and democracy. Please join United24 today. Thank you, everyone! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! On this day, the 101st day of the full-scale war, the Skete of All Saints burned down in the Svyatohirsk Lavra in the Donetsk region. It caught fire as a result of Russian artillery shelling. Not the first shelling of the Lavra. Three Lavra monks were killed by the Russian shelling on Wednesday. Worship services are forced to be held in the basement. The roar of artillery and the \"arrivals\" of Russian shells are constant in the Lavra. And this is one of the three Lavras of Ukraine. This is the Lavra of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is still considered in Moscow to be connected with the Russian Orthodox Church. Even this does not stop the Russian army. They are ready to burn everything: Orthodox churches just like anything else in Ukraine. During the full-scale war, 113 churches have already been destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling. Among them are the ancient ones - those that withstood World War II, but did not withstand the Russian occupation. There are also those that were built after 1991. Reconstruction of the Skete of All Saints of the Svyatohirsk Lavra began in 2001. June 10 would be another anniversary of the beginning of construction. I was interested in what Russian propagandists would say about the destruction of the skete. But, in fact, nothing interesting. They are very predictable. Ukrainians are accused of arson. Although the monks and laity in Svyatohirya saw perfectly that it was Russian artillery. I believe that this lie of the propagandists, this shelling, and the support of the Orthodox hierarchs in Russia for the aggression against Ukraine - all this should motivate the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to draw conclusions. More decisive conclusions and a clear condemnation of each of those who condone aggression. Ukrainian diplomats will do everything to make everyone in the world aware of this another crime of the occupiers. Russia is deliberately and systematically destroying Ukraine's cultural and historical heritage, as well as social infrastructure, housing, and everything necessary for normal life. A state that does this cannot be a member of UNESCO and cannot remain at the UN as if nothing had happened. The UN Charter does not provide any rights for terrorists, and UNESCO is not a place for barbarians. Russian troops again fired at the border areas of the Sumy region, Mykolaiv, cities and communities of the Zaporizhzhia region, Kharkiv region. The situation in Severodonetsk, where street fighting continues, remains extremely difficult. It is also difficult in Lysychansk, Marinka, Kurakhove, other cities and communities of Donbas. Constant air strikes, artillery and missile fire. As of this morning, the total number of various Russian missiles used against Ukraine is already 2,503. Our heroes hold their positions and do everything to inflict maximum losses on the enemy. I am grateful to each of our defenders who are approaching the day when Russia will have to leave Donbas alone. Today in our country the memory of children who died from Russian aggression was honored. Over the past day, the worst figure - the number of children killed - has not changed. 261 children. That's how many Ukrainian children lost their lives because of Russia. But this is the official number. The more we learn about those who were buried in the occupied territories, the greater, unfortunately, may be the number of names on this list. It's scary to read. Year of birth, place of residence, circumstances of death... All of them would be alive now if only one person in Moscow had not caused this catastrophe. This can no longer be fixed. Because this war is already going on. But the terrible consequences of this war can be stopped at any moment. The Russian army can stop burning churches. The Russian army can stop destroying cities. The Russian army can stop killing children. If the same person in Moscow just gives such an order. And the fact that there is still no such order is an obvious humiliation for the whole world. Eternal memory to all who died from the Russian invasion! Eternal glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Greetings from Kyiv! I will start this address with a short yet very important quote. \"If we live in some world, we hear some songs or radio, we watch some movies - this is all that creates us, creates our mentality.\" These are the words of Mantas Kvedaravičius. He told them commenting on his film about Mariupol. A film with which he wanted to show how war affects the city. How war changes people. And these are seemingly simple words. But they are really about how it is determined what kind of life people have and what kind of people they are. Art itself, culture - in all its forms and in all their senses - shape people, educate them. Or vice versa - close them in the dark, in lies. And it can also be the responsibility of movies, books, songs and radio - everything we hear, see, read. That is why it is important to bear the truth. It is important to support art that is for life, not for those who want to destroy that life. Ukrainians will remember Mantas Kvedaravičius as a man who was just like that. He really deserves the Golden Swan. He valued life and always spoke out against what was life-threatening in his view - and that was a very attentive view. And I ask you to be just as attentive. So that you also support life. And remember Ukraine, Mariupol, and the fact that this war that took Mantas' life, Russia's war against Ukraine, must end. End as soon as possible. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, dear Ukrainians! Today, it's the night address, so I will be brief. There was a lot of work. An endless day. I was in Zaporizhzhia, Zaporizhzhia region. Expressed support to our military and awarded the best. Heard the report. We were in positions. Had a meeting with the head of the regional state administration, the leadership of the local police, the Security Service, and some mayors of the temporarily occupied cities. Met with Mariupol residents, who managed to leave the city alive and with children. Here they were met by Khortytsia, humanely and warmly. Conditions - I saw - are temporary, but not bad. Understood their difficult questions. I think we will solve them. Each family has its own story. Most were without men. Someone's husband went to war, someone’s is in captivity, someone’s, unfortunately, died. A tragedy. No home, no loved one. But we must live for the children. True heroes – they are among us. After that, together with the Head of the Office we headed east. We were in Lysychansk, we were in Soledar. I am proud of everyone whom I met, whom I shook hands with, with whom I communicated, whom I supported. We brought something to the military. I will not talk about it in detail. We also brought you something from them. It is important. We brought confidence. And strength. I wish them health. Low bow to their parents. I wish victory to all of us. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Good health to you! Today was a busy day. A day of important communication, important meetings. I congratulated the journalists on their professional holiday. During the war, the word \"holiday\" sounds very unnatural, but every year on this day, June 6, greetings are heard for the people on whom, of course, we all depend. On the information they spread. On the speed at which they work. Of course, we do not celebrate this year. But still, we congratulate them. We still note the contribution of journalists of Ukraine and all those on whom the work of the media depends: cameramen, engineers, editors, photographers, producers and everyone without whom broadcast is impossible and websites will not work. These are the people who keep the information front and to whom I am grateful for this on behalf of all of us, all Ukrainians. Today I awarded correspondents and media workers who are working on the battlefield now. I also presented awards to the relatives of those whose lives were taken by the war. 32 media workers have been killed since February 24. This list includes different biographies, different personal stories. And not only citizens of Ukraine. Today, during a special ceremony in the President's Office, everyone was remembered. Their memory was honored with a moment of silence. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. I informed him about the situation on the battlefield, about our capabilities and key current dangers, especially in Donbas and in the southern regions of Ukraine. I am grateful to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for fully understanding our needs and for his willingness to provide Ukraine with the weapons we so desperately need to protect the lives of our people. I also spoke with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Of course, about defense support for Ukraine. This is a mandatory topic for each of my negotiations. And I am grateful to our partners who act quickly and do not postpone their decisions. I am grateful to Poland. The issue of candidate status for Ukraine was also discussed with Andrzej, which is a key political issue right now. We are waiting for the decision of the European Union on our application in the coming weeks. I believe that this will be a decision not only about Ukraine, but also about the entire European project. About whether it has a future as a really strong union. I am preparing for a new wave of appeals and communication with the political and expert communities of the world in order to guarantee our state the support we so desperately need. This is a constant process - the maintenance of attention, and it cannot be stopped for a single moment. And that applies to everyone, really. Every modern person is well aware of how the media works. It is very difficult to keep an eye on one topic for a long time. For the attention to Ukraine, to our struggle for freedom not to decrease, everyone must continue to talk about what is happening. Please share information. Support our needs. Of course, this primarily applies to journalists. And today, by the way, I want to wish them not to be locked on our internal Ukrainian context. The more we say about Ukraine in the world, the sooner we will be able to end the war and liberate our land. Of course, this applies to all representatives of the state and Ukrainian politics. Work for our defense - in unity and in full force. But do not forget that business, culture and ordinary people can also do a lot to keep Ukraine at the top of global attention. A simple example - today I was presented with postage stamps issued in Spain in support of Ukraine. It may seem that the postage stamp can’t change anything. But it is a symbol of the attention to our struggle that millions of people will see. Creating such symbols, encouraging the creation of such symbols, talking about Ukraine and encouraging talks about Ukraine - this is what will help us in negotiations with representatives of states on specific important assistance that Ukraine needs today. Our heroes hold their positions in Severodonetsk. Fierce street fights continue in the city. Lysychansk, Slovyansk, Bakhmut, Sviatohirya, Avdiivka, Kurakhove and other directions of Russian strikes are the hottest points of confrontation today. The Russian army is trying to use additional forces in the Donbas direction, but it is the 103rd day - and the Ukrainian Donbas stands. It stands firmly. We do everything for the defense in the Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv directions as well. I am grateful to everyone who endures the strong pressure of the occupiers and defends our state. 17,864 combatants have been awarded state awards of Ukraine since February 24. This number 100% demonstrates the scale of our people's heroism that became the response to Russia's full-scale invasion. I signed a new decree today on awarding our military. 121 warriors were awarded, 32 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you! A brief report on the past day. There were many activities - both diplomatic and domestic. First, the government is setting up a headquarters to prepare for the next heating season. This decision was made as a result of a meeting I held today with both government officials and representatives of our largest state-owned energy companies and regulators. Prime Minister, Ministers of Energy, Economy, Minister for Communities and Territories Development, heads of Naftogaz, Ukrenergo, Energoatom and the National Commission for State Regulation of Energy and Utilities. The relevant Deputy Head of the Office of the President was also present. Whatever the occupiers plan for themselves, we must prepare for the next winter - in our state, on our land, for all citizens. The issues of purchasing a sufficient amount of gas for the heating season, coal accumulation, and electricity production were discussed today. In the current situation due to Russia's aggression, this will indeed be the most difficult winter of all the years of independence. But! Everything is alright. We must go through it so that our people feel the normal work of the state. At this time, we will not be selling our gas and coal abroad. All domestic production will be directed to the internal needs of our citizens. At the same time, we are doing everything we can to increase our electricity export capabilities. This will be made possible by the capacities available in Ukraine. And after the historical accession of our country to the unified energy network of Europe, such exports not only allow us to increase our foreign exchange earnings, but also directly influence the stabilization of the energy situation in neighboring countries, which reduce Russian energy consumption. Another important aspect is the repair program for thermal power plants, combined heat and power plants and boiler houses. In particular, for those who were damaged or completely destroyed by Russian strikes. Implementation of this program in the coming months is one of the top tasks for the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine. I would like to emphasize that I have set a very specific task for the government to do everything possible to ensure that gas and electricity tariffs do not change in the next heating season. People already face enough difficulties because of the war. This will be provided. Local authorities are responsible for tariffs for heat and hot water, and the same level of tariffs should be ensured at the local level in the winter of 2022-2023 as well. I also held a meeting on communication with the European Union and with individual EU member states on our application and candidate status. Diplomatic activity in this direction does not stop even for a day. I hear daily reports, including on the preparation of procedural decisions in the European Union. The team of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our diplomats, the team of the government in general - all, absolutely all are working to achieve a significant historical decision already in June, which we all expect. For its part, Ukraine has done all, absolutely all the necessary work for this. As they say in such cases: the ball is in the court of European structures, European countries. The frontline situation in Ukraine has not changed significantly over the past 24 hours. The absolutely heroic defense of Donbas continues. The hottest spots are the same. First of all, Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Popasna. It is felt, absolutely felt, that the occupiers did not believe that the resistance of our military would be so strong, and now they are trying to attract additional resources in the Donbas direction. Just as in the Kherson direction – new units are being transferred there to restrain our actions. But what's the point for them? The majority of the occupying contingent is already well aware that they have no prospects in Ukraine. We hear this mood in the appropriate interceptions of conversations. This is the prevailing mood in the Russian army. We are free people. We are not your slaves. More than 31,000 Russian servicemen have already died in Ukraine. Since February 24, Russia has been paying almost 300 lives a day for a completely pointless war against Ukraine. And still the day will come when the number of losses, even for Russia, will exceed the permissible limit. We are actively working to raise funds to support our army and to rebuild Ukraine after hostilities. In the territories that are already de-occupied, we return electricity, gas, water supply, communications. It’s not easy, but we do it. Of course, much remains to be done. It is necessary to provide hospitals with equipment, carry out demining. And, of course, rebuild everything destroyed by the occupiers. One of the tools for this is the state fundraising platform UNITED24. In the first month alone, more than one and a half billion hryvnias have been raised with its help. And I am grateful to everyone who contributed to its creation, to its work. Today, Elina Svitolina, our famous and very successful tennis player, became the ambassador of UNITED24. Together with Andriy Shevchenko, the first UNITED24 ambassador, Elina will work to attract new support for our country. Everything for Ukraine. This way, working together, each of us will be able to return normal life to all territories to which our military has returned security. And another piece of news that can be reported now. Next week, a special \"Book of Torturers\" is planned to be launched - an information system that collects confirmed data on war criminals and criminals from the Russian army. I have repeatedly stressed that they will all be held accountable. And we are approaching this step by step. The creation of such an information system has been going on for some time already. These are specific facts about specific people who are guilty of specific violent crimes against Ukrainians. And such a \"Book of Torturers\" is one of the foundations of the responsibility of not only the direct perpetrators of war crimes - soldiers of the occupying army, but also their commanders. Those who gave orders. Those who made possible everything they did in Ukraine. In Bucha, in Mariupol, in all our cities, in all the communities they have reached. Everyone will be brought to justice. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by these occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who is bringing our victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the invitation! Glad to be able to address you today. I know that business people will listen to me, not politicians, so I will be as specific as possible. So that both your time and my time are used to maximum advantage. Ukraine has been subjected to an unprovoked and extremely brutal full-scale attack on our land by the Russian Federation. This war has been going on for 105 days already. And we are waging this war in such a way that, I am sure, no one has any doubts about our victory anymore. It will definitely be achieved. And the more qualitative our cooperation is, the faster it will happen. I offer you to consider today two horizons of cooperation with Ukraine - short-term and long-term. Of course, you can join our success story. Join our victory. Just now. These are very simple, very transparent tools. The first tool is our United24 platform, a special fundraising platform with which we accumulate funds to restore life after hostilities. This is demining, this is the purchase of equipment for hospitals, humanitarian support. This is very important. Each contribution gives us the opportunity to see that Ukraine has one or another specific but true friend. Hence, we see who we will be grateful to. The second tool is Ukraine's military bonds. Even now, during a full-scale war, we are demonstrating absolutely conscientious service of our debt. So, military bonds are a tool for you to support us in the fight for freedom and to make money. Make money for you. But I still want to pay more attention to the long-term horizon today. To the reasons why it will be profitable for you to cooperate with Ukraine not just now, but now and for many more years to come. I offer you to see it in the long run as they say. What exactly are these opportunities? I will name five main ones: Europe, IT, agriculture, green energy, localization of production. Ukraine is access to the entire market of the European Union. Duty free access. We are working to ensure the same access to the G7 markets. And this is our own market, one of the largest in our region. Ukraine is qualified hard-working specialists, one of the best in Europe. Ukraine is a space of digitization that gives simplicity, gives, most importantly, transparency to any relationship between person and state, between company and state. This is something you will not find today in most countries of the world. Ukraine is an IT sector that enjoys one of the most favorable legislations in the world - a special legislative regime \"Diia City\". And I propose to move the headquarters of IT companies to Ukraine, to create joint service centers and R&D centers. Ukraine is resilient institutions even during a full-scale invasion. Our banking system, finances, government agencies remain absolutely stable, working in spite of everything. Ukraine is an agricultural sector whose global significance has already been seen by all when Russia blocked our ports. It is our agricultural sector that is key to the markets of dozens of countries. It is really profitable to develop processing in Ukraine. Ukraine is industrial parks that provide special opportunities for any manufacturing enterprise. Huge potential in various industries, from aerospace to woodworking. Ukraine is rich in natural resources, from natural gas to lithium ores. And Ukraine is green energy, green fertilizers and green hydrogen. All this together is a guarantee of Europe's future energy security when we replace Russia with its dirty fossil fuels. Ukraine is an ambitious program of post-war reconstruction, which will be the largest economic project in Europe of our time. All of these are priorities for me, so they can become priorities for you as well. Nowhere in the world will you find all these economic factors at once. They are only here, in Ukraine, and you can already join the work with them. And, of course, I understand that next to everything I say now, there is one word. And this is the word \"war\". The war continues. But we withstood a powerful blow. We defend our territory. And we are moving towards one of the greatest military successes in Europe. We will win this war. And working with you, it will happen faster. Political history always goes alongside economic one, and when success is possible, it can be common only - both at the state level and at the business level. We offer you just such a success. Because we feel that our defense in this war and our work for the victory have shown everyone in the world that we really deserve success. I invite you to cooperate! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Exactly 10 years ago, this day marked the start of EURO 2012, the European Football Championship, which brought together all Ukrainians, Ukrainians and Poles, Ukrainians and the vast majority of Europeans. The opening ceremony was in Warsaw, the final ceremony was in our capital, Kyiv. The matches were hosted in different cities of our two countries and in particular in Donetsk, at the Donbas Arena. Only 10 years have passed - and it seems that it was in another world. Just today, the occupiers announced the absolutely crazy news that they are preparing to unite some football clubs from all occupied territories into one pseudo-championship - from Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Melitopol, Crimea, and even part of Georgia. It's just a mockery of the occupiers over people who remember everything well. 10 years ago our Donetsk was a strong, proud and developed city. And then Russia came. Brought ideas of just such an inadequate level. And now it is a ghost town that has lost most people, thousands of lives and absolutely all prospects. Only the return of Ukraine, which will definitely happen, only our flag and only Ukrainian law will mean a normal life for these territories, for these cities - again. The life that was there. Peaceful, safe, open to the world. And of course - new matches of world-class teams at the Donbas Arena. I am grateful to President of Poland Andrzej Duda, a friend of all Ukrainians, for the fact that he has now started a special trip to European countries to support the European perspective of our country. This June we are to get a decision on the candidacy. And all our friends, all our diplomats are now working for this, working in full. President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová was to go with Andrzej - such a joint initiative of the two leaders was planned. A positive COVID-19 test hindered it. Well, these are the conditions of our life now. I wish Zuzana a speedy recovery. I spoke today with German Chancellor Scholz. About the decision in favor of Ukraine on the candidacy as well, which, in fact, will be a decision in favor of Europe. We talked about defense support. And about food security, guaranteeing which is really a global interest already. Because no one can be interested, except the Russian state, in the global food crisis. I addressed today the participants of the investment conference organized to discuss the economic prospects of our state. Representatives of the world's largest funds were among the participants. Although the event was not public, it was still very important and powerful. I invited them to invest in Ukraine. Invest. I also talked to members of the community of leaders of major American companies. This is the 133rd such summit, and this year it brought together the leading forces of global business. We discussed how business can help Ukraine withstand. I urged them to leave the Russian market and not to support this war with their taxes. It is very important for me to see that such an audience - and these, I emphasize again, are representatives of the most influential part of American business - believes that sanctions against Russia should be strengthened. Therefore, it would be right for politicians to hear this position. Leading business and the majority in American and European societies believe that there is still not enough pressure on the Russian Federation to end this war. According to the results of this day, the 105th day of the full-scale war, Severodonetsk remains the epicenter of the confrontation in Donbas. We defend our positions, inflict significant losses on the enemy. This is a very fierce battle, very difficult. Probably one of the most difficult throughout this war. I am grateful to everyone who defends this direction. In many ways, the fate of our Donbas is being decided there. I also signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 285 combatants were awarded state awards, 68 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to our heroes who defend the state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and gentlemen! Greetings from Ukraine! And thank you for the opportunity to address you. When I learnt that I was named the most influential person of the year, I took it as a recognition of what all of our people are doing – all Ukrainians who are defending the freedom and independence of our state. And I am honored to be a leader, above all, for these people. Besides myself, this year’s top five features Elon Musk, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson, medical workers who fought with COVID, and President of the United States Joe Biden. This ranking of the most influential is made at a time when Europe is experiencing the worst war in 77 years. The war we cannot stop yet. Why so? Why cannot we stop the bloodshed? Why is our influence not working at full capacity? And why is a person who is not on our list at all holding millions of people hostage? I believe you will agree that these questions are now literally hanging in the air. But do you have the answers? The runner-up of our top list is Elon Musk. A man who launches rockets into space and knows how to amaze the world. A man who pushes the boundaries of the possible for both intelligence and technology. But the opinions of world leaders are not focused on Elon. Not on his rockets, which ensure progress in life. Opinions of world leaders are dedicated to those who launch rockets at civilians and destroy lives. In 105 days of the full-scale war, Russia has used about 2,600 different missiles against Ukrainian cities, most of them against civilian facilities: enterprises, railways, bridges, universities, even residential buildings. One of such rockets killed three people in our city of Odesa at once: a three-month-old girl named Kira, her mother and grandmother. Three generations of one family. Kira was only a month old when Russia started a full-blown war. What did she see in her life? And what did her assassination add to Russia’s influence? At the beginning of this war, I spoke with Elon. He asked me what he could do to help. And help he did. Thanks to his technologies, we can provide our people with a stable connection even when Russian missiles destroy all infrastructure. But are there any world leaders who are worried about whether or not Elon will pick up the phone when they call him? Or, those worried whether he will accept them? Are there leaders who think about how long the table will be when Elon Musk sits down to talk to them? So what does the influence really give? What rockets? Those that serve science? Or those that serve death? Something has definitely slipped out of control. Whether it's our own influence, which we began to underestimate, or our attitude to leadership. Attitude to what it means to be a leader. I have so much respect for Boris Johnson. He is a true friend of Ukraine and a strong defender of freedom. But, unfortunately, not all depends on him whether millions of people in Africa, Asia and Latin America will have food on their tables. It is the Russian fleet – not the British one or any other – that has blocked Ukraine’s Black Sea ports so that the world is on the brink of a terrible food crisis. And it's not simply a price crisis. We cannot export our wheat, corn, vegetable oil and other products that have played a stabilizing role in the global market. This means that, unfortunately, dozens of countries may face a physical shortage of food. Millions of people may starve if Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea continues. We are constantly talking to Boris and other leaders on how to lift the Russian blockade of our ports. And how to restore the freedom of navigation – one of the basic freedoms for all humankind. But while we are looking for ways to protect freedom, another person is destroying it. Another person continues to blackmail the world with hunger. He is another in every sense of the word. Particularly, in the way this person is fighting for influence. And I have a question: why is this “otherness” still acceptable to certain leaders and countries? I leave this question to you. Because, in fact, everyone has to answer it – first of all, for themselves. To feel deep inside what is called values. Do they exist? It is only fair that the medical workers who fought against COVID have been noted this year in the Time vote. They really are the heroes of their time. And with their conscientious work, they have encouraged the whole world to unite. Finally to unite. At first, people in different countries thought that it was enough to just close the borders and provide themselves – themselves first – with the vaccine. But later it became clear that COVID-19 has no borders and cannot be dealt with only within national borders. Even the most advanced healthcare systems were not ready for the virus. And, unfortunately, had to go through a grievous injustice, fighting with COVID-19 to find a vaccine. To agree on common rules of response, a global mechanism for the distribution of vaccines. Why is this happening again? Why is it so difficult again? Weapons and sanctions are also a vaccine. A vaccine against COVID-22 brought by Russia. Hatred is a virus, and it's even more deadly than COVID-19. It is spread through propaganda. Thanks to the impunity for murderers. Thanks to Russian oil, which is still on the global market. Thanks to money that is still flowing between the global financial system and Russian banks. Thanks to the big companies, which still believe that there is still not enough blood on the money from the Russian market. Although tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been forced to flee their homes because of this war. When hatred knocks on your door, will you be ready? Will any face mask protect you from the Russian COVID-22? And why is the vaccine against it – weapons and sanctions – so difficult to get in sufficient quantities? Why do some countries pretend as if COVID-22 does not exist, just like conspiracy theorists for whom there was no COVID-19? Why do some people learn nothing even from blood and death? I am grateful to President Biden for uniting the free world when the Russian threat arose. Today we have different tools to respond. These are defense support for Ukraine, financial aid and political coordination among many countries. It is also the Lend-Lease, which brings back the meaning of the struggle for freedom that was relevant during World War II. Because the current threat is similar in scale. However, Russia’s war against Ukraine is still ongoing. And right now, as you are listening to my address, the Ukrainian military are dying on the battlefield. The Russian army is shelling our cities with artillery and aircraft. The list of children killed by Russian strikes since February 24 already includes more than two hundred and sixty names. And when will this end? In fact, this is the key question. But why is there still no answer? Why is our influence not enough for this? Are we cowards? No. Maybe we are missing something in our true strength? Maybe we are not using all the capacity of our influence and our leadership? And this is my question to the United States, both to the parties and to society; to both Democrats and Republicans; to the Congress and to the President. It is time to be one hundred percent influential. We can defeat tyranny. Indeed, every one of us – every one – is the leader of our time. We can reliably defend freedom. We can stop blackmail by a person who has no place on our list at all. If we are up to it, then we must do it. Because influence obliges us to do so. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Mr. President of the Council of Ministers Mario Draghi! Mr. President! Macky Sall, Chairperson of the African Union, President of Senegal! Mr. Secretary-General Mathias Cormann! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am glad to have an opportunity to address you today. Today - when the world is in the midst of several global crises: the food crisis, the energy crisis and the crisis of values - I would use this very concept to describe a crisis that is often called geopolitical. Values. And I will explain later why this is so. A year ago - in the same summer time as now - when these three crises were being prepared, and were being prepared directly by Russia, the world did not want to see where it was heading. It did not want to see how much could depend on the development of the situation here in our part of Europe. Russia's war against Ukraine and, more broadly, Russia's aggression against all the rules of life in Europe and the world have had dire consequences. Tens of thousands of people have been killed. Hundreds of cities and villages in Ukraine have been destroyed. About 12 million people in Ukraine have become displaced persons, reflecting the biggest migrant crisis in Europe since World War II. The Black Sea, which is one of the key routes for food exports, is blocked by the Russian navy. Hundreds of millions of people on different continents are on the brink of at least food shortages and at most famine for which Russia will be fully responsible. Europe is experiencing one of the most difficult energy situations in its history... And we do not yet know what other crises Russia is preparing for the free world. What will happen if the Russian army uses weapons of mass destruction? What will happen if as a result of Russian strikes a threat will emerge, for example, to drinking water sources in our region? Or a threat of radiation or chemical pollution of the Black Sea basin, and hence parts of the Mediterranean? When Ukraine warned the world about Russian preparations last year and stressed the need for tough preventive sanctions against Russia, so that Moscow would at least feel that any aggression would not go unpunished, the world did not hear us. When we said that Russia's policy of energy conquering of Europe was aimed at creating problems not only for Ukraine - and our gas transportation system - but also for all Europeans, it was not fully perceived by some leaders in Europe itself. And when we warned that Russia's aggressive actions to block free navigation in the Sea of Azov would lead to much greater negative consequences, many in the world simply did not want to believe it and openly said that it was allegedly impossible. But all this is not just possible. That's what happened. And this is because Russia was not shown in time that the world can be tough when it comes to defending common interests. Basic interests - peace, security, freedom, free trade and predictability of life. Ladies and Gentlemen! For a long time, the world has not recognized the importance of Ukraine and the weight of our warnings. But Russia has always known that a few steps against our state, a few steps in our region - and the consequences will be felt on all continents. That is why Russia needs control over Ukraine. That is why it is the basic interest of the world now to help protect Ukraine. Russia's war against our state must end as soon as possible so that the security of food supplies across the Black Sea can be guaranteed. Because it is Ukrainian agricultural exports that play a stabilizing role in the global market. And Russia must be held accountable for provoking a new wave of migration against Europe, using the people of both Africa and Asia simply as hostages. For this, long-term painful sanctions must be applied against Russia at the global level. There can also be no question of Russia's continued membership in the FAO – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. What has Russia to do there if it is working for starvation of at least four hundred million and at most more than a billion people? We need to guarantee Ukraine's long-term security as soon as possible so that we can guarantee Europe's long-term energy security and replace Russian fossil fuels on our continent through green energy transformation and green hydrogen. And, of course, we need to start the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine as soon as possible to ensure that none of the environmental threats posed by Russia during the war against Ukraine hit our people and neighboring nations. The Ukrainian Donbas, which Russia is simply destroying with brutal missile, air and artillery strikes, has been one of the world's most prominent industrial regions. And these are deep coal mines, metallurgical and chemical enterprises. Any hostilities in such a region - and even more so with the use of weapons now used by Russia - is a threat of pollution to a vast area. Threat of pollution of groundwater and rivers, and hence the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. Just imagine the level of losses - for Europe and the world. Ladies and Gentlemen! At the beginning, I said that the world was in a crisis of values. In what way is it reflected? There are no such governments and countries, no international organizations that do not understand the global threats of Russian aggression. But there are governments, countries, and international organizations that believe they may sit out and not react to what is happening. This is a problem of values, not geopolitics. They talk about geopolitics when they don't want to admit that they are giving up values. I am grateful to you for remaining principled. For the fact that you are really willing to defend values. Because it is on the basis of values that sustainable development and sustainability of progress are possible. This was the right decision - when you terminated all cooperation with Russia and stopped the process of Russia's accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, when you closed the Organization's office in Moscow. And this should be an example for other international organizations. We must continue to use all instruments of pressure on Russia, both at the level of international organizations and at the level of countries, to stop its aggressive policy. The world must remove everything that hinders cooperation and development, and Russian aggression is the first key obstacle, the first key threat. And I believe that in the near future we will be able to begin to use in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine all the experience of the OECD, which is based on the implementation of the historically significant Marshall Plan. I am grateful for the decision to open a regional office of the Organization in Kyiv, our capital. This is the recognition of the importance of our country, our region for global cooperation and development. And I hope, Mr. Secretary-General, Mr. Mathias, that very soon we will be able to meet with you in our Kyiv office - in the Kyiv office of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Thank you for your attention!  Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! I have recently finished a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron. We talked primarily about defense support. Of course, this is a key topic. I informed Emmanuel about the situation on the frontline, about the possible development of confrontation in the coming days and weeks, about the intentions of the Russian occupiers and about our resistance. Of course, we talked in detail about Ukraine's European perspective. We are preparing for a response to our application for candidacy. The issues of security guarantees for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe were also touched upon. I am grateful that we discussed this topic with the President of France. We continue our work. I also spoke today with the Prime Minister of Montenegro about the path of our countries to the European Union. In fact, we exchanged experience. We continue very active work in all the countries of the European Union on a daily basis, so that the situation regarding the candidacy for our country is equally perceived there - in the west, in the east, in the north and in the south of the European Union. Most Europeans support Ukraine's integration. And if Europeans support it, politicians who are still skeptical in some countries should not oppose themselves to the people, society and the very course of European history. I addressed the participants of the ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It is one of the most influential international organizations in the world. They severed ties with Russia. But substantial decisions are also needed - we need concrete pressure on Russia for what it is doing, including the crisis it has provoked in the world food market. I held a very important meeting with government officials today. Economy, business, jobs. We discussed actions at three levels - what needs to be done right now, what we can do in the near future, no matter how difficult it is, and what we will definitely do after the war. The first is a program of special grants to support small and medium-sized businesses. What can already provide new jobs and a new tax base. The second is the development of our security sector in all its aspects. Both now and in the future. It is also a question of jobs, a question of professionalism and technologies. The security sector in Ukraine must become completely different from what it has been all these 30 years. From the state border to every street, to every school, to every infrastructure object - security must be 100% ensured. And the third aspect is industrial recovery and attracting investment to the state. Localization, industrial parks, support of the state order, attraction of modern technologies to Ukraine. Relevant state programs are being prepared. There are many discussions in Ukraine today about what the economic policy of the state should be both during the war and when we restore peace. I want to emphasize one detail. And this detail is fundamental. We have to get used to the fact that there can be only two parts of society - those who defend our independence and those who work in a way to ensure that defense. And this is not a question of one or another economic doctrine, not a question of one or another political position. We simply cannot afford to leave the shadow part of economic life in the country. Of course, I understand that in some of our regions now, any economic activity - official or nonofficial - is a matter of mere survival. But if we talk about the normal, stable and strong life of society, the work of the state, our defense, we must understand: there are those who serve, and there are those who provide with their work those who serve. So, this is official employment. This is the payment of taxes. This is the maximum expansion of economic opportunities in our country on legal grounds. And this is a complete modernization of state institutions. Everyone who works in Ukrainian politics, who influences the public debate, should realize that there will be no more shadow in the country. I am grateful to our communication workers, who today resumed television broadcasting in Kharkiv after the morning shelling literally within a day. Striking at TV centers, destroying communication channels, leaving people in isolation - these are the tactics of the occupiers, which they really cannot do without. Because openness and honesty are also weapons against everything that the Russian state brings. The frontline situation today is without significant changes. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk and other cities in Donbas, which the occupiers now consider key targets, are holding on. We have a certain positive in the Zaporizhzhia region, where we manage to thwart the plans of the occupiers. We are gradually moving forward in the Kharkiv region, liberating our land. We are keeping defense in the Mykolaiv direction. I am grateful to all our defenders who made this possible. Thanks to which we have endured 106 days of full-scale war already. Eternal glory to all who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Rasmussen! Dear attendees! Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the opportunity to address you. Last year, at the Fourth Copenhagen Democracy Summit, the question arose as to where the frontline between freedom and oppression lies and how to protect freedom from authoritarianism. Well, this year we got the answer to this question not just in discussions, but on the battlefield. This year has shown that the state border of Ukraine is an actual line of confrontation. But between what and what? Just between freedom and oppression? Or just between democracy and authoritarianism? Yes, between them. But this confrontation can also be viewed from another point of view. It can be assessed not only in terms of political regimes or ideologies. It also needs to be looked at in terms of the ability to turn a word into action. This is the fundamental ability of any system - public, state, business. If this ability is not lacking, the system loses. Of course, we are all raised in cultures that value the word. And the democratic system is always based on the fact that the word matters. And I do not want to underestimate the importance of discussions, opinions, and positions. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that it didn’t take much time for one system to turn words about a people that allegedly does not exist into brutal hostilities aimed at destroying that people. Or to turn the words that some territory is supposed to be part of another state into action to capture this territory. Can democratic systems help this nation that becomes a victim of aggression as quickly as tyranny starts aggression? Does the democratic world have the tools to defend this territory, which someone there has decided to seize, just as quickly? Last year, at a summit like this, such words could be the basis for an interesting discussion about the power of Europe and Russian tyranny. But this year we see that these are absolutely practical questions on which the fate of millions of people directly depends - and, in fact, not only in Ukraine. Because the Russian state is interested in a much larger territory than the sovereign territory of Ukraine, and Russia does not recognize the right to independent existence not only of the Ukrainian people. Ladies and Gentlemen! Let's take a closer look at some words that have not yet turned into action. The word is always the basis of the law. This is always the basis of the treaty. Conventions, statutes, declarations and, of course, memoranda. During the Russian war against Ukraine alone - and it has been going on, I will remind you, not since February 24, but since 2014 - Russia has violated about four hundred different international treaties to which our states are parties. Here are just a few examples: UN Charter; UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; Corpus of conventions governing the laws and customs of war; International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict; UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. From key global documents we can move to fundamental ones for Europe. The Russian state violated: CSCE Final Act 1975; European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Statute of the Council of Europe. And we should all recall the Budapest Memorandum, the violation of which by Russia adds maximum cynicism to this picture. With this violation, Russia has put an end to the entire struggle for nuclear disarmament in the world. What is the point of talking about nuclear disarmament now that Ukraine, whose third-largest nuclear arsenal has been taken away, has been attacked by a state that was among those who signed a pledge to refrain from aggression and still remains a nuclear state? Democracy is always respect for words. International law is also respect for words. But they work and are able to win in confrontations only when they can be backed up by action. When a word literally means action. So, returning to the question of where the line of confrontation between freedom and oppression lies, it is worth saying that it also lies between the ability to simply say something and the willingness to act to reinforce certain words - promises to voters, words in negotiations and texts of conventions. On the Ukrainian border, in the Ukrainian Donbas, near Kharkiv, in the south of Ukraine, we can now see that the Ukrainian people are really ready to back up their words about independence with appropriate actions in defense of independence. But where is the frontier where it will be seen that Europe is also ready to back up all the words important for it with appropriate action? If polls show that 71 percent of Europeans consider Ukraine part of the European family, why are there still political skeptics who are hesitant to allow us to move to the European Union? If Europe's core values imply that every nation has the same importance and should be equally respected, why have the Ukrainian people been told for so long that they must remain in the gray zone between the European Union and Russia? If Russia cynically violates literally all vital documents of international law, why are there still those who are hesitant to block any relations with such a state? These questions indicate, in fact, that the European system can lose if words are not backed up by action. A democratic system can lose even on our continent if there is no action. So, first of all, we need to finally remove this gray zone, which is so tempting for the Russian state. We need to move from words that Ukraine is part of the European family to action. In the coming weeks, the European Union can take a historic step that will prove that the words about the Ukrainian people's belonging to the European family are not empty. Secondly, there is a need for effective, legally binding security guarantees in a renewed security architecture for the European continent. We are currently working on such a system of guarantees for Ukraine. And only when it appears can we say with confidence that the thousands of words on the pages of conventions, statutes, treaties and memoranda are not just words, but a reality backed up by action. We must also finally learn to act preventively. Not just to react, but to act as soon as words of aggression are heard. When it becomes clear that the war can start at any moment. The aggressor must feel the power of the democratic world, the power of international law as soon as he intends to violate the existing basic norms. And the third mandatory point is that all war criminals must always be held accountable. Justice must have its say. And the word of justice must be backed up by action. For every death inflicted in Ukraine by Russian soldiers, for every torture and rape, for every city destroyed, for the deportation of people and children, both those who did it directly and those Russian commanders and politicians who gave such orders must be held accountable. Democracy must be effective - in every sense. Europe must be effective. If words are said, if they were put on paper and became documents of international law, they must work. They must act. And when that happens, there will be no question of who will win and where this frontline is. Of course, democracy. Of course, Europe. And above all in the minds of leaders who must act, not just speak. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear students, lecturers, professors, academics! 16 minutes 19 seconds. This is the record of The Boat Race. The legendary rowing competition on the Thames between Oxford and Cambridge. And the first Boat Race in history took place on this day, June 10, almost 200 years ago. Yes, it's just a beautiful, symbolic fact, and I'll be honest: it doesn't do much for this speech. I could compare the present in Ukraine with a difficult boat race: against the current, waves and storm, where our state is \"steering\", sails to freedom, opposes the Russian warship, and it is important for us to feel that we are not alone. That all the countries of the free world are in one boat. And Ukraine doesn’t have to send an SOS signal to everyone on the 107th day of the war! I could say more, but I'll be honest: I don't want this speech to last 16 minutes 19 seconds. Although, again, I'll be honest: it had every chance to be such. Preparing for the meeting, I read a lot about the history and traditions of your educational institutions. To speak one language with you. To tell about the present of Ukraine very clearly and understandably for each and every one of you. For 107 days in a row, Ukraine and our people have heroically opposed Russian aggression. For many, our steadfastness has become a mystery and almost a miracle. Just as the Oxford Electric Bell and its design - it is still unknown exactly how it works. So is Ukraine, which for 107 days in a row has been continuously generating energy that resists the world's second army and defending itself and Europe, and if Ukraine runs out of battery, this will be a real energy crisis on the planet. For 107 days in a row we have been passing the survival exam. Every day we seem to be passing the Cambridge Tripos. On a chair with three legs, under the roar of an air-raid siren. For 107 days in a row, Ukraine has been resisting barbarians, savages, dementors. The army of \"he-who-must-not-be-named\", according to some politicians. Even more so it is inadmissible to refuse to buy oil, gas, etc. from him. For 107 days we have been facing the enemy who has not read one of the founders of the London School of Economics - Bernard Shaw. Who does not recognize the worldview that now that we have learned to fly the air like birds, swim under water like fish, we lack one thing – to learn to live on earth as human beings! The enemy who does not recognize the truth, for which the rector of the University of Birmingham, Nobel Peace Prize winner and architect of the League of Nations Robert Cecil fought. About the vital need for humanity to resolve conflicts not in the trenches, but at the table. The advantage of arguments, not missiles. For 107 days in a row, we have been opposing a state that is suffering from a new form of color blindness. It calls black white, and white black. It declares peaceful goals, but makes peaceful cities and villages its target, killing women and children, calling it self-defense. 80 years ago, Manchester survived the Christmas Blitz. This spring, the whole of Ukraine survived the Easter Blitz. 80 years ago, the Nazis razed Coventry. This year, the ruscists created dozens of new coventries in Ukraine. These are Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Kharkiv, Mariupol. For 107 days in a row, we have been opposing a nuclear power that deserves the wooden spoon for ignorance of international law and the Darwin Award for violating it. As you can see, I was completely honest when I said that I was seriously preparing for our conversation. Is irony and humor appropriate on my part in such times? It can’t be otherwise. Impossible. I could cite many more analogies, quote hundreds of worthy graduates of your universities, but honestly I’d rather ask: what do you know about us? Recently, students at the University of Edinburgh exposed their professor for spreading Russian propaganda and lies while lecturing on the war in Ukraine. Excuse me for the tautology. Such news, like hundreds of other signals we see and hear from you, testify to at least three things. You are not indifferent to the war in Ukraine, lies about this war are noticeable and disgusting, but the truth is known, necessary and important. At the same time, you know the truth about Ukraine and the war. You know about Ukraine because of the war. You read about the shelling of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Mariupol. But did you know that these cities are sister cities of Leeds, Birmingham, Liverpool? Have you heard of the Kyivan Letter? A document of the times of Ukraine-Rus’, which is more than 1000 years old, which is stored in the Cambridge Library? About Queen Margaret, the first Saint of Scotland, granddaughter of the Grand Duke of Kyiv Yaroslav the Wise. Have you heard about the founder of Donetsk - Welsh engineer John Hughes. Or about the founder of Luhansk - Scotsman Charles Gascoigne, who built the first coal mine in Ukraine. The point is not that we have common pages of history. I'm not trying to surprise anyone with this right now. The point is that this is perhaps the best description of the essence of the war that Russia is waging against us. Its goal is to erase our history, to erase our statehood, our identity, to deny our existence as such. To say that we never existed. That we are an artificially created people, as if we are not humans, but a variety of plants or a species of animals. To devalue our culture, to humiliate our language, to cross out our art. Our musicians, writers, philosophers, scientists, designers, inventors, all the great rulers and all the great warriors of Kyivan Rus’, Zaporizhzhian Sich, who existed, exist and will exist. Russia's goal is to erase all associations about Ukraine except the war. Ukraine without the past, without the bright moments of the present, and therefore without the right to the future. Why, you may ask, is Russia doing this? Because it has a global phobia at the state level. This is a phobia of freedom. For them, this is an unfamiliar, unknown, and therefore very frightening force. Even if freedom is not in their country, but in a neighboring country. Freedom is nearby. For Russia, it is dangerously close. It wants to destroy it. But it will lose. We are fighting for our future, they are fighting for someone else's past. But the time of such countries and rulers has passed. And our time is our time, this is the future. And this is an active voice. Real voice. Voice of truth, honor, wisdom and freedom. And let's talk to you with this voice today! I do not want this speech to last 16 minutes 19 seconds. So let's finally begin! And to be honest I will be very honest. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! A brief report on the passing day. By the way, it is the 107th day of our defense already. Very fierce fighting continues in Donbas. I repeat these names every day: Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Slovyansk, many, many others. I repeat them at meetings with the military, with diplomats, talking to representatives of partner countries. Russia wants to destroy every city in Donbas, “every” is not an exaggeration. Like Volnovakha, like Mariupol. All these ruins in once happy cities, black traces of fires, craters from explosions - this is all that Russia can give to its neighbors, Europe and the world. This is probably the fastest example of the complete degradation of any state - the path that the Russian state has covered in 107 days. The Ukrainian troops are doing everything to stop the offensive of the occupiers. As much as possible. As much as the heavy weapons, modern artillery - all that we have asked and continue to ask our partners for - allow them to. I met in Kyiv with Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom Ben Wallace. We talked exactly about this – how to stop Russian aggression, how to deprive it of offensive potential, what other supplies are needed for our army. The Britons demonstrate true leadership in defense matters. I also addressed the British university community today and talked to students. I work at all levels so that the world can hear us and know what we need. There were many questions from students about what our life would be like after this war. About reconstruction, attracting leading experts, about the education system. Of course, we are preparing for a large-scale restoration of our state. Of course, we have already started reconstruction in the liberated territory. Of course, we will change a lot in our lives after this war. And it is good that the world is interested in details, they want to join, they are thinking how to find opportunities to work for Ukraine after our victory. But the battles are still going on. And right now, in these very difficult battles, it is being decided when this \"after\" will come. It is being decided at which frontiers we will finally break the plans of the occupiers. And everyone should remind societies in other countries of this. Of the battles that are going on now. Of the support that is needed now. It depends not only on politicians and diplomats. But also on journalists, activists, entrepreneurs, our displaced persons who are abroad. Now is the time that all Ukrainians must be one - a nation that is fighting and does not allow the world to divert its attention away from what is happening on the battlefield in Ukraine. I also addressed the participants of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit today. I spoke, in particular, about the response of the European Union, which we expect for our application for candidacy. I will emphasize again and again: this will be the EU's response not only to Ukraine, but also to its own future - the future of the European project. I am grateful to the British Government, the World Bank and the Government of Canada for new steps in financial support for Ukraine. The day before, our country received 1.5 billion US dollars: one billion is the World Bank, another 500 million is Britain. Direct budget support. We will use it to pay salaries in the public sector. Canada, for its part, became the first country to send 1 billion Canadian dollars to our administrative account in the IMF. The Government of Ukraine has already started implementing the decisions discussed at this week's meetings. A bill has been approved that will allow customs clearance of cars through the state service in \"Diia\". The whole process of customs clearance will be fully transparent, convenient and immediately remove all the shadow schemes that were possible in previous years in this area. I hope that the people's deputies of Ukraine will quickly vote for such a step. Also today, the government has already presented specific details of new state programs that should provide new jobs and support for business in this very difficult time for all of us. This applies in particular to non-repayable grants for micro-businesses and other special financial support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Despite all the pressure from Russia, despite all the Russian strikes, we will do everything to revive Ukraine's economy, economic activity. In the evening I signed two decrees awarding our heroes. In total, 242 combatants were awarded, eight of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by the occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear participants of the Shangri-La Dialogue forum! Ladies and Gentlemen! Mr. Director! Thank you for the honor of speaking to you today. When I was preparing for this meeting with you - so far a virtual meeting, but I hope for live meetings during my visits to your region after our victory in the war - so when I was preparing for this meeting, I was told about a girl. She wrote me a letter asking to support her initiative called Spray Paint Ukraine. This is an initiative to help Ukraine. She created this image, but an NFT image, and gave me this T-shirt so I could wear it, and thus help everyone know about her initiative. And I thought that this situation - this girl's appeal, her idea, her confidence that the President of Ukraine can respond to her initiative, as well as the fact that I am really ready to help - will be important. I wore this T-shirt today. And this may help explain why Ukraine has gained such support in the world and why we will definitely win this war that Russia has started. Can you imagine, for example, the President of Russia, who would respond to the initiative of a girl from your country, to such an initiative? Who would just see a letter of appeal to the Embassy in Singapore to support the idea of a girl unknown to him and wear a T-shirt sent to him? I think this is impossible at all. And that's what really happens. This is the confrontation between \"possible\", which we and many others in the world need, and \"impossible\", for which Russia is desperately fighting. Russia wants to make it impossible for a neighboring country, which it sees solely as its colony, to be able to exist freely, to exist independently. That is why the Russian army has already killed tens of thousands of our people, deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to its territory. Russia has already used 2,595 cruise missiles against us alone - and that's in 108 days! Russia wants to make it impossible for our land, resources and water to be used in the interests of our people. It wants to steal all this, and is actively looting the territory it managed to occupy. Absolutely everything is taken from there - from cars left on the streets and in the yards to equipment of the seized factories, from scrap metal to grain. Just imagine the meanness of the Russian Federation if its representatives stole even a few trolleybuses from our city of Mariupol, which was completely destroyed by the Russian army. This is the \"great Russia\" - stealing trolleybuses. It wants to make it impossible for the nations of the world to be confident in the freedom of navigation. In this basic freedom for peace and prosperity in any region of the planet. From the first minutes of the full-scale war against Ukraine, Russia blocked our ports in the Black Sea using its fleet. During the war, the Russian military attacked, in particular, peaceful merchant ships, and also fired missiles at our port infrastructure. Today, the Black Sea is the most dangerous sea in the world. And this is solely Russia's fault. Although on February 23 this year, on the eve of the war, free and safe navigation was possible in the Black Sea. I can cite such examples for a very long time - examples of what Russia wants to make impossible. I am sure that in many of these examples you will be able to see what is valuable to you. What makes your life the life you value. And I am convinced that you are all interested in the possible free and independent life of your nations, the preservation of your culture, your material and resource wealth. So that no one robs your property, so that your cultural treasures are not taken away. So that no enemy fleet can make your seas dangerous for navigation. Russian propaganda is trying hard to spread in your countries, as in many others, the disinformation thesis that Russia's war against Ukraine is allegedly something about NATO, about the role of America, about the West's attempts to advance somewhere in Europe. But Russia's war against Ukraine is far from just about Europe. It's about globally important things. The Russian leadership wants to reject all the achievements of human history, including the system of international law that we have today, and return to life as in the XIX century or even earlier.  When everything that gave billions of people a chance for harmonious development and prosperity was impossible. That is why I want to remind you of the words of a man you all know well: \"If there was no international law and a big fish ate a small one and a small one ate a shrimp, we would not exist.\" These are the very wise words of Lee Kuan Yew, a leader who could see the real causes of many things and processes and who knew what should really be appreciated. And that's why I'm in this T-shirt now, that's why I responded to the request of a girl from Singapore. We must value our opportunities. We must appreciate what has been made possible by the wise leadership in the past, by the struggle of many generations of various nations. We must appreciate what gives us the chance to live in peace and work for the common good in our societies and in the world. Hence, we must stop Russia. We must stop the war that this state has started against my state, trying to return the world to the old days, when the freedom of nations and people's lives did not matter. We must break the ability of Russia or any other country in the world to block the seas, to destroy the freedom of navigation. If sanctions, then sanctions. If mirror measures to limit the service of Russian ships in ports, then mirror measures. Russia must feel that its aggressive policy has consequences primarily for itself. And if this does not happen, if the Russian blockade prevents us from continuing to export our food, which the global market currently lacks, the world will face a severe food crisis and famine in many countries in Asia and Africa. Food shortages will inevitably be followed by political chaos, which could lead to the fall of many governments and disaster for many politicians. And you can already see how this catastrophe is approaching, just by looking at rising prices for basic products on the world market and in some countries. This is a direct consequence of Russia's actions. Finally, we must return full force to international law. Since February 24, 287 children have died in Ukraine as a result of Russian strikes. And that's just what we know officially. We do not yet know how many people were buried in mass graves in the occupied territories and how many bodies remained in the ruins of houses in cities still controlled by the Russian army. For murder and torture, for deportations, for destroyed cities, for the use of illicit munitions, including phosphorus bombs, for blackmail with chemical and nuclear weapons - for all this, any state, not just Russia, must be held accountable. And we can make it possible! If we act in a coordinated manner. Although Russia, of course, will try to make it impossible. We can ensure UN reform. So that all states abide by international law, so that no one violates the world order. The UN system and, in particular, the UN Security Council today do not provide a fair representation for most nations of the world. The voices of entire regions of the planet often cannot be heard when it is vital. If this reform had already taken place, we today would be able to respond to any aggression - not just that of Russia - at a truly global level. Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful to you for supporting Ukraine. I am grateful to you for your attention to our state. But remember that this support and attention is not only for Ukraine, but also for yourself. For making your future secure. It is on the battlefield in Ukraine that it is being decided what rules the world will live by and what will be possible and what will be impossible. Let's save the world from going back to the days when everything was decided on the basis of the so-called right of force, and individuals and any of their ideas, like many nations, simply did not matter. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I wish health to all Ukrainians and all our friends! The final phase of the big diplomatic marathon, which is to end in a week and a half, has started today. And in this marathon we are actually together with the European Union - in one team, and this team has to win. I am sure that we will soon receive an answer on the candidate status for Ukraine. I am convinced that this decision can strengthen not only our state, but also the entire European Union. What else needs to happen in Europe to make it clear to skeptics that the very fact of keeping Ukraine outside the European Union works against Europe? For example, everything is already obvious to the Russian occupiers. They say so when they torment our people that it is allegedly for the fact that Ukraine has gone to Europe. And why does Europe have skeptics then? We will continue to work even harder at all levels to get the right decision. It is very important for us. Very fruitful talks with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen were held in Kyiv today. I am pleased to note her sincerity. It is the European Commission that will prepare a conclusion regarding our application. Ukraine provided all the necessary answers in a very short time, and it was done well. There will be many more equally important and, I hope, fruitful talks with European leaders next week. I talked to the participants of a very representative security forum in Asia, in Singapore. High level. The event was attended by defense ministers and other high-ranking officials from dozens of countries of the region. We really need this region. And I felt that today my address was heard there, arguments were heard and perceived. News about the distribution of Russian passports in Kherson and the distribution of passports in Melitopol were actively spread in the occupied territories and in Russia. And I looked at who in this news was shown as Kherson and Melitopol residents who allegedly want Russian passports. A few collaborators and people from their entourage... Well, it looked like not a queue to get a passport, but an attempt to get a ticket to flee. Very demonstrative. The Ukrainian troops are gradually liberating the territory of the Kherson region. Today the village of Tavriis'ke has been added to the list of returned settlements of our state. There is certain success in the Zaporizhzhia region as well. Fierce street battles continue in Severodonetsk. I am proud of all our defenders who managed to stop the advance of these hostile people, these occupiers for many weeks already and keep our defense strong. Do you remember how Russia hoped to capture the entire Donbas in early May? It is already the 108th day of the war, it is already June. Donbas is holding on. The losses suffered by the occupiers, including in this area, are extremely significant. In total, the Russian army today has about 32,000 dead souls. For what? What did it give you, Russia? No one can say now how long this burning of souls by Russia will last. But we must do everything to make the occupiers regret that they have done all this, and to hold them accountable for every murder and every strike at our beautiful state. Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen, CORE and all the participants of this charity evening! 107 days ago, Russia launched a full-scale war against us. All of you have heard about the horrors that Ukraine is going through. Tens of thousands of explosions and shots. Hundreds of thousands wounded and killed. Millions who have lost their homes. All of this is not a logline for a horror film. All of this is our reality. All of you have seen photos from Ukraine. Peaceful cities and villages wiped off the face of the earth. All of this is not the scenery of a blockbuster about the apocalypse. All of this is our reality. All of you have seen footage from Ukraine. Cruise missiles and bombs that raze schools, hospitals, theaters, museums, entire streets and neighborhoods to the ground. It is not VFX, not computer graphics. All of this is our reality. But definitely we will rebuild Ukraine. Streets and neighborhoods, peaceful cities and villages. We will heal bodies from wounds and souls from losses. All of this is not a synopsis of a fiction film. All of this is our reality and our future. And all of you can help us in this. During World War II, when all the metal was needed at the frontline, the Oscar statuette was made of plaster. It can fairly be said that this is a symbolic gesture that does not drastically affect the course of the war. But we cannot claim that the world would have defeated Nazism without a piece of metal. No. We do not know for sure. That is why we know that any help is valuable and important. I thank everyone who has come here today for the sake of this help – help for Ukraine. Mr. Sean Penn, who has been personally in Kyiv and Ukraine since the first day of the war and has seen firsthand this evil, which is called Russian full-scale aggression. You were ready to melt your Oscar in protest against the lack of support to Ukraine. I hope that this will not be necessary. Other metal must melt. Weapons of barbarians, which kill civilians, women, the elderly and small children, must melt. The aggressor’s equipment, its tanks, planes, ships, rockets and all other iron that brings evil must melt. We have been resisting it for 107 days in a row. We can stop it together. Support Ukraine because Ukraine supports the whole world. Fight for Ukraine because Ukraine is fighting for the whole world. For democracy. For freedom. For life! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! After the missile strike at the Ternopil region, ten people are still in hospitals. There was no tactical or strategic sense in this strike, as in the vast majority of other Russian strikes. This is terror, just terror. Among the victims is a 12-year-old girl from Kharkiv. She went to the Ternopil region to flee from the Russian army. And such facts will now determine perception of Russia in the world. Not Peter I or Lev Tolstoy, but children wounded and killed by Russian strikes. Today is the 109th day of a full-scale war, but it is not the 109th day as we tell our partners a simple thing: Ukraine needs modern missile defense systems. The supply of such systems was possible this year, last year and even earlier. Did we get them? No. Do we need them? Yes. There have already been 2606 affirmative answers to this question in the form of various Russian cruise missiles that have hit Ukrainian cities. Our cities, our villages for the period from February 24. These are lives that could have been saved, these are tragedies that could have been prevented if Ukraine had been listened to. The key tactical goal of the occupiers has not changed. They are pressing in Severodonetsk, where very fierce fighting is going on - literally for every meter. And they are also pressing in the direction of Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Slovyansk and so on. The Russian army is trying to deploy reserve forces in Donbas. But what reserves can they have now? It seems that they will try to throw into battle poorly trained conscripts and those who were gathered by covert mobilization. Russian generals see their people simply as the cannon fodder they need to gain an advantage in numbers — in manpower, in military equipment. And this means only one thing: Russia can cross the line of 40,000 of its lost troops already in June. In no other war in many decades have they lost so much. I prepared an address to the American Jewish Committee. A global forum organized by the committee began in New York today. This is one of the most influential structures that helps promote decisions for our protection. I called on them to redouble their efforts so that we could get more modern weapons, more financial support for our state, so that we could end this war sooner. This week I will continue to address the parliaments of the partner countries, in particular the parliament of the Czech Republic. Many talks of various levels with European politicians are also planned. We work every day with the European Union on the candidate status for Ukraine, and our state has done everything for a positive response. The only question is the determination of some European leaders. We will continue to work to facilitate access of Ukrainian goods to all important markets around the world. Customs duties on trade with the European Union have already been abolished. The United States already applies a duty-free regime for Ukrainian steel. Canada has abolished customs duties. The same regime will work in the near future with Britain. We expect trade liberalization from Australia. The Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization has started today. Before it began, representatives of 57 countries gathered for a special event of solidarity with Ukraine, and I am grateful to them - to each and everyone - for that. And as a result of this intergovernmental conference, we will learn, in particular, the timing of the decision on trade liberalization for Ukraine from Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland. So the week will be significant. And I believe that there will be good news for Ukraine. I am grateful to all who defend our state! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen, friends! Mr. David Harris! Every morning I receive several informational reports. Regarding the situation on the frontline, the Russian missile strikes at Ukraine, at our people, and the number of victims of hostilities over the past day. Today, as I record this address, the report on the deceased has changed significantly. The list of killed children became longer by 24 surnames at once, and now it has 287 items. And this is probably one of the worst things that happen during a war. The Russian troops have occupied part of our country, and we do not have complete information about what is happening in the occupied areas. We do not know everything about the murders and other crimes they commit there, in the occupied part of Ukraine. We do not know what they did against our people. We do not know how many bodies the occupiers buried in mass graves or left in the ruins of destroyed cities. But gradually we learn about it. And that's how the list of killed children became 24 points longer at once - these are the children who died because of Russian strikes at Mariupol, now we know about them. The boy Maksym is among these 24 children, he was born this year; and the girl Darya, she was also born this year. Maksym and Darya did not live even three months. They died with their parents when they were all buried in the basement of an ordinary apartment building on which a Russian aircraft dropped a bomb. Tell me why is this happening in 2022? This is not the 1940s. How could mass killings, torture, burned cities, filtration camps set up by the Russian military in the occupied territories, which resemble Nazi concentration camps, become a reality? And yet Russia hopes that it will not bear responsibility for all this evil, for all these barbaric strikes at houses, hospitals and churches. Russia still has the power to hope to continue the war against Ukraine, against people and ignore the world's reaction. Ladies and Gentlemen! I am aware of your substantive help for our state. But I ask you to redouble your efforts to stop Russian hatred. Hatred for humanity. Yes, it is hatred that is the driving force of this ongoing Russian war against Ukraine and against freedom in Europe, in the world. Hatred for Ukrainian - for the culture of Ukrainians, for the history of Ukraine and for the fact that despite all the horrors of the past, Ukraine has remained a kind and open country for different cultures. Diversity is an important feature of Ukraine. What will be left of this openness, of this peaceful coexistence of different peoples? Russian shells burn even Russian churches in Ukraine. The Russian army destroyed communities in which the Greek community had lived for centuries. Crimean Tatars are the most repressed on the occupied peninsula. Russian missiles hit Babyn Yar in Kyiv, Russian artillery damaged the Menorah in Drobytsky Yar near Kharkiv. Openly anti-Semitic remarks by Russian Foreign Minister have instigated a global scandal. Is this not enough? But it is really not the 1940s now. Therefore, defend the need to enhance sanctions against Russia. You are capable of it. Help us speed up the supply of weapons to Ukraine so that we can liberate the occupied territories. We need powerful weapons for the offensive, without which the war will only drag on and the number of victims will increase. I know that your help is already significant. But you can use even more of your influence. Because we now have a historic opportunity to defend our common freedom, our common security, our common cultural diversity from the greatest wave of hatred that has threatened the world in recent decades. So, let's end this war! Let's defeat Russian hatred! In the name of children killed by the Russian army. And for the future of millions of children in Ukraine and in various European countries who deserve to live in security and peace. To just live. Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Strong people of an unbreakable country! Today is the 110th day of our defense. And when you say that - the 110th day - you realize what a great path we have covered. The enemy was driven out of the Zhytomyr, Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions. A large part of the Kharkiv region was liberated. In total, more than a thousand settlements have been liberated. The invasion of the occupiers in the south of Ukraine was stopped. Yes, they still want to destroy Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, and the cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region. They still have enough strength to shoot from the artillery at Zelenodolsk and Hulyaipole. Odesa remains a target for the Russian fleet... But dozens of the attacking attempts of the Russian army have already been thwarted right there in the south. And thanks to the counteroffensive, some communities in the Kherson region have already been liberated. In the battles in Donbas - and they will surely go down in military history as one of the most brutal battles in Europe and for Europe - the Ukrainian army and our intelligence tactically still beat the Russian military. And this is despite the significant advantage of the Russians in the amount of equipment, and especially - artillery systems. The price of this battle for us is very high. It’s just scary. And we draw the attention of our partners on a daily basis to the fact that only a sufficient number of modern artillery for Ukraine will ensure our advantage and finally the end of Russian torture of the Ukrainian Donbas. Today it became known about the death of another child caused by the Russian shelling - right there, right in Donbas, in the Luhansk region. The boy was born in 2016. He lived in Lysychansk, in an ordinary house on Moskovska Street. This is it: a six-year-old boy on Moskovska Street is also, as it turned out, a dangerous enemy for the Russian Federation... We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move on. Free our entire territory. Drive the occupiers out of all our regions. And although now the width of our front is already more than 2.5 thousand kilometers, it is felt that the strategic initiative is still ours. We will come to all our cities, to all our villages, which do not yet have our flag on the administrative buildings. Although there are a lot of Ukrainian flags there, in people’s houses, I'm sure of it. And we have already seen them when people protested against the occupiers. And we will see them again - everywhere, when we return. We will come to Kherson. And ordinary Kherson residents will meet our army on the streets of the city. The failure of the occupiers, who tried to celebrate the so-called Russia Day, only proves that Kherson is a Ukrainian city. And Kherson residents will celebrate only Ukrainian holidays. We will come to Melitopol. And we will return to all Melitopol residents the opportunity to live without fear. And, by the way, all the collaborators who are now threatening to take away land from farmers in Melitopol and other districts of Zaporizhzhia will most likely end up in this land themselves. We will come to Mariupol. And we will liberate the city for the third time. It was liberated from the Nazis in 1943 by a brilliant operation. In 2014, on this day, June 13, thanks to the courage of our \"Azov\" and other units, Mariupol was liberated for the second time. Liberated from the militants, who at that time were not yet fully aware of what the Russian state was sending them to. And now they see it all. They see burned Mariupol. They see why the Russians came there. But we will not allow them to make this city dead. We will return it. Definitely. It only takes enough weapons to make it happen. The partners have it. In sufficient quantities. And we work every day for the political will to give us these weapons to appear. We will come to Enerhodar. And I want to repeat to everyone in the city who took to the streets against the Russian military, who refuses to cooperate with the occupiers and who is waiting for us today. I want to repeat that we have not forgotten about our Enerhodar for a day. We must understand that the occupiers are keeping the occupied territory not just in an information blockade. I would call it a civilizational blockade. They are trying to make people not just know nothing about Ukraine and how we are trying to liberate our territory. They are trying to make them stop even thinking about returning to normal life, forcing them to reconcile. In some areas, the occupiers are deliberately preventing the restoration of electricity supply. In many communities, they simply blocked communication. Our television is being turned off. They closed the exit from the occupation and simply do not even allow humanitarian corridors so that we can bring people at least basic goods and medicines. And I ask everyone who has such an opportunity to communicate with people in the occupied south, in Donbas, in the Kharkiv region. Tell them about Ukraine. Tell them the truth. Say that there will be liberation. Say it to Kyrylivka, Henichesk, Berdyansk, Manhush. Say it to Horlivka, Donetsk, Luhansk. Say it to everyone in the Kharkiv region who is still forced to see the Russian flag on our Ukrainian land. Tell them that the Ukrainian army will definitely come. Of course, we will liberate our Crimea as well. The flag of Ukraine will fly again over Yalta and Sudak, over Dzhankoi and Yevpatoriya. And let every Russian official who has seized precious land in Crimea remember: this is not the land where they will have peace. There is no one today who will say exactly how long our path to victory will take. But the vast majority of people today are already aware - this is our path. This is how this war will end. We will rebuild everything that was destroyed by the occupiers. From Volnovakha to Chortkiv. Because this is Ukraine. And it is our destiny to return and strengthen it. I am proud of all our defenders! Eternal glory to you! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by the occupiers! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today, our air defense units managed to \"cut the wings\" of Russian missiles. Some of the missiles fired by the occupiers at our cities were shot down. And these are saved lives. This is a saved infrastructure. But we managed to shoot down only part of them. Unfortunately, there are victims, there is destruction. Today, the Lviv and Ternopil regions were hit. And we keep telling our partners that Ukraine needs modern anti-missile weapons. Our country does not have it at a sufficient level yet, but it is our country in Europe that needs such weapons most right now. Delay with its provision cannot be justified. I will constantly emphasize this when talking to our partners. We made the first requests for anti-missile systems long before the full-scale invasion. And this week there will be many different important talks - and not only with European politicians who are able to provide Ukraine with modern anti-missile systems. Even though Russia has fewer and fewer modern missiles with each passing day, Ukraine's need for such systems remains. Because Russia still has enough Soviet types of missiles, which are even more dangerous. They are many times less precise, and therefore threaten civilian objects and ordinary residential buildings much more. I spoke today with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. Of course, the number one topic was defense support. Canada is among the leaders in it. I expressed gratitude for the fact that Canada became the first country to transfer special assistance to the Ukrainian account at the IMF - about $ 800 million. I also had a conversation with the President of Ecuador. I congratulated him on the election of Ecuador as a member of the UN Security Council. I informed him about the current situation on the battlefield and called for increasing pressure on Russia to end this war. Both this conversation with the President of Ecuador and yesterday's conversation with the President of Guatemala are just the beginning of our new policy of restoring relations with Latin America. Today I asked the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to be very attentive to reports in the media and on social networks that some of our fighters do not have enough personal protective equipment. The reports I receive are significantly different from what is discussed by society. And I expect inspections of logistics in the army - inspections of what is supplied and how personal protective equipment is distributed. Today, everyone in the areas of hostilities must have everything they need to protect themselves. The state provides such supplies. Over the past day no drastic changes have taken place in the battle in Donbas. The fiercest fighting is in Severodonetsk and in all cities and communities nearby - as before. The losses, unfortunately, are painful. But we have to hold on. This is our state. It is vital to hold on there, in Donbas. The more losses the enemy suffers there, the less power they will have to continue the aggression. Therefore, the Donbas direction is key to determining who will dominate in the coming weeks. We also have painful losses in the Kharkiv region, where the Russian army is trying to strengthen its position. The battles for this direction continue, and we still have to fight hard for complete security for Kharkiv and the region. We continue to put pressure on the occupiers in the south. The key goal is the liberation of Kherson, and we will move towards this step by step. I signed another decree on awarding those who excelled in battles. 63 servicemen were awarded for bravery and efficiency in defending the state. The total number of awarded is already 18,453. And such a scale, such a number of feats fully demonstrate the level of confrontation and the brutality of hostilities. I thank everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by the occupiers! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President of the Senate! Dear Madam President of the Chamber of Deputies! Dear Prime Minister, members of the government! Dear members of the parliament, attendees, journalists! Dear Czech people! First of all, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to address both houses of the Parliament of the Czech Republic and absolutely all Czechs in this format today. I would like to thank you for those warm words, strong words of support for our people, me personally, our state, which were heard here today, and for the warmth with which you shelter our forcibly displaced persons. We appreciate it, it's truly historical. I am grateful to you for this personally and on behalf of every Ukrainian. I was thinking how to begin my speech. I will begin with words that each of you knows for sure and that all Europeans who respect history and freedom on our continent know for sure: Jsme s vámi, buďte s námi! These are words of extraordinary importance. They had such importance when they sounded on Czech radio in 1968, supporting the resistance. They are extremely important now as well, when - recalling them - we are talking about those who fought for freedom for your people. But, in fact, these words have one more dimension. Now, when the Ukrainian people are fighting for freedom against the brutal Russian invasion, we can say that it is with these words that we, Ukrainians, address all the peoples of Europe, all the peoples of the democratic world. We are with you, be with us! We oppose tyranny, which - as in the past - does not want to stop only in Ukraine. It considers everyone in Europe its target, all those who live a free life. Russia is not interested only in our cities of Mariupol, Severodonetsk, Kharkiv, Odesa and Kyiv. No. Its ambitions are focused on the vast space from Warsaw to Sofia, from Prague to Tallinn. And as in the past, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is only the first step that the Russian leadership needs to open the way to other countries, to the conquest of other nations. This is openly said not only by Russian state propagandists, but also by Russian officials. They have already reached the point, for example, of threatening to officially revoke the recognition of the Baltic states' independence. And then what’s next? Who is next? Ladies and Gentlemen! When Ukraine appeals to European countries for support, we are guided by this principle, by these words that have become one of the foundations of your history: we are with you, be with us. Russian tanks storming the cities of the Ukrainian Donbas, trying to attack the Ukrainian Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, must be stopped and burned or expelled from the territory of independent Ukraine. So that they can never again come to Prague, or to Ostrava, or to Brno, or to Pilsen, or to Karlovy Vary, or to any other city on our continent. It is in Ukraine that the battle for the future of Europe is taking place right now. I am very grateful to your state, to your people for the generous help in this struggle. The Czech Republic helped us both with weapons - very substantively and immediately after it became necessary - and politically. I thank the leadership of the state for that. You can be sure that you have supported yourself and your own freedom, your own life with that. And support must be maintained for as long as it takes to win. This is how this confrontation must end - with victory. And even if some politicians in some countries are afraid of the possibility that freedom will win and tyranny will lose, there are no your leaders among such politicians. The Czech people are well aware of how compromises at the expense of others end and what concessions to tyranny lead to, which proposes to take away only the supposedly part of the desired territory to pretend that the aggression has stopped. He who wants to capture everything will never stop, taking only part. I urge you to continue together with us, without stopping for a moment, to convince all those who have not yet managed to choose a clear side in this confrontation, which has been going on for 112 days already, of this simple truth. Ukraine must get everything to win. Modern and powerful enough weapons - the Prime Minister talked about that today - to get advantage over the Russian army. Financial support - to have resources against Russia, whose savings and revenues are still very significant - in 100 days of this war since February 24 Russia has already earned 93 billion euros on the sale of energy only. Ukraine must also receive fundamental support of values that will finally deprive Russia of its main ideological weapon, namely the assertion that Europe is incapable of real unification and that it does not need Ukraine. In the near future, we must receive an answer from the European Union - from all member states - to the question of Ukraine's status. Providing Ukraine with the candidacy right now is proving that European unification is real and that European values really work and are not just defined in certain documents as a beautiful formality. The Russian troops are well aware that they are fighting against European values, against the fact that any free people of Europe who share common European values can become part of the European Union. This is the ideological firmware of the Russian occupiers. So strengthening Europe's union and saying “yes” to Ukraine is also a defense in this war. This will be another historical manifestation of the meaning contained in the words: we are with you, be with us. That is why I ask you to be as active as possible these days, these weeks, so that all European leaders agree that defending and strengthening Europe is our common cause, and so that no one can make an exception to this principle. The fateful Czech “eights”  - 1938, 1948, 1968 - are comprehensive answers to all those who still want to \"pacify\" the aggressor by betraying European values and weakening Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Czech people! The Czech presidency of the European Union will begin in a few weeks. And at this time there will be no less challenges before us, before the whole of Europe, than now. But they are transforming. I very much appreciate the key attention paid to Ukraine in the priorities of the Czech presidency. We have to agree on the seventh package of sanctions against Russia for this aggression, for this war. And we also have to substantively move on to the reconstruction of Ukraine - of the entire liberated territory. When you, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Petr, visited our capital in March, you became one of the first European leaders to boldly show that Europe is and will be with Ukraine. And I believe that the Czech Republic will be among the leaders in the implementation of the largest economic and infrastructural project of our time - the Ukrainian reconstruction. This is a special opportunity to show all the strength of Europe - technological, institutional, creative. We must ensure full synchronization of the Ukrainian National Reconstruction Plan and the European Reconstruction Platform in order to implement them as efficiently and quickly as possible. I also invite you to join the reconstruction of Ukraine at the national level - taking patronage over one of the regions or cities, or communities, towns of Ukraine, which suffered from Russian aggression. Such a reconstruction will be the best proof that no aggression, no matter how brutal, will ever achieve its goals and be ever able to break any of the European nations, let alone Europe as a whole. I am grateful to you for the sincere and full support of our people, our Ukrainian temporarily displaced persons. You have sheltered hundreds of our people fleeing the war on your land. Thousands of people live in your homes, receive help from your families. We must do everything so that each and every one of them can return home, return to Ukraine. We can come - and we will come - to the fact that the principle of following the rule: \"Jsme s vámi, buďte s námi!\" - will have a result that can be described in other important words - in the words of Václav Havel: \"Truth and love have to overcome lies and hatred.\" Unfortunately, this has often failed in the history of Europe. But now, in 2022, in Ukraine and, most importantly, together - we can ensure this so powerfully that the fruits of our victory will be enjoyed by many generations of our nations. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you! The long and very busy day is over. Foreign policy has been a priority since the morning. In two vital areas at once - defense and Europe. I have just finished my conversation with Boris Johnson. Key topics were defense support and coordination of steps on the eve of important meetings in June. Today there is a lot of news about the third meeting in the \"Rammstein\" format. This is a format for the work of defense ministers of partner countries that determine the support packages for our country. And the news is really good. We expect an increase in this support.  By the way, we have another signal that defense support for Ukraine will be continued. As part of Rammstein, Britain and Denmark announced a special donors' conference in Copenhagen in August. 14 states are preliminary involved. I had an important conversation with US President Biden today. The United States has announced a new strengthening of our defense, a new $ 1 billion support package including coastal defense, artillery, modern rocket systems. We will be looking forward to it. I am grateful for this support, it is especially important for our defense in Donbas. I am also grateful for the leadership in mobilizing the help of all partners. There is also a new package of humanitarian support for Ukraine - a quarter of a billion US dollars. We also discussed with President Biden the tactical situation on the battlefield and ways to accelerate our victory. Sanctions, politics, economic cooperation - we are preparing for new steps. I was invited to speak at the NATO Summit in Madrid, as well as at the G7 meeting. In the afternoon there was a special summit with the leaders of the Western Balkans - the Prime Ministers of Montenegro and Albania came to Kyiv, and the Prime Minister of North Macedonia was present in a video format. Ukraine has received a significant decision by these countries to support the status of a candidate for EU membership for us - three countries have adopted such a joint statement. In fact, today we are as close to this status as we couldn’t have dreamed of even a few years ago. Ukraine has done everything possible to obtain a candidacy. And today, in my address to the Parliament of the Czech Republic, I emphasized that the response to our candidacy will be the response of the European Union not only to Ukraine, but also to themselves - their future, the future of the European Union. Of course, the Russian state would not be itself if it simply watched our foreign policy success. Gas pressure on Europe is growing again. The shelling of Ukrainian positions and peaceful cities is intensifying again. Today they hit Mykolaiv, communities of the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Kharkiv region. Russian propagandists have become more active in producing fakes to provoke despair in Ukraine. But I do not believe that at least some of these fakes can work. We are defending Donbas. And, by the way, in all international contacts I hear admiration for the actions of our defenders. The world really wants to learn from Ukrainians how to fight and how to win. During the 112 days of this war, the Ukrainian army proved that courage and wisdom on the battlefield, together with the ability to tactically defeat the enemy, give significant results, even despite the significant advantage of the Russian army in the number of soldiers and equipment. Of course, we will do our best to outmatch their advantages for now. Every day I fight for Ukraine to get the necessary weapons and equipment. But courage, wisdom and tactical skills cannot be imported. Our heroes have it. I signed regular decrees awarding Ukrainian warriors. 284 servicemen were awarded state awards, 60 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal glory to everyone who defends the state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today is a truly historic day - Ukraine has felt the support of four powerful European states at once. And in particular support for our movement to the European Union. Italy, Romania, France and Germany are with us. All four leaders - Mr. Draghi, Mr. Iohannis, Mr. Macron and Mr. Scholz - support Ukraine's candidacy. Of course, all relevant procedures must be followed, and all EU member states must join. But at our meeting today a big step was made - a step forward. It was important for me to hear from the leaders another fundamental thing - they agree that the end of the war and peace for Ukraine must be exactly as Ukraine sees them. As our people see them. I am grateful to Italy for its principled political support, macro-financial and defense assistance. Historically we now have the best relations - and I am sure we can do a lot more for our nations. I am grateful to Romania for the defense assistance and assistance in the transit of our goods, including grain. We agreed to increase export capacity through the territory of Romania. France will provide additional Caesar artillery systems. This is very important for our defense. Also today, President Macron openly said that the European support for Ukraine should really demonstrate that we defend the same values, defend Europe together. Germany has confirmed the provision of air defense systems for our country and further support. By the way, when four leaders arrived in Kyiv today, it coincided with the beginning of the air raid siren. Russia has created a background for everyone to hear these sirens to create a tense atmosphere. But no one was scared, and it only inspired us to be as specific as possible and to negotiate for our interests - for all Ukrainians and for all in Europe. Today I personally thanked Chancellor Scholz for inviting me to the G7 meeting. In general, my impression of the meeting is positive. All leaders understand why negotiations to end the war are not under way. Exclusively because of Russia's position, which is only trying to intimidate everyone in Europe and continue the destruction of our state. They do not want to look for a way to peace. This is an aggressor who must decide for himself that the war must end. We will continue to fight until we guarantee our state full security and territorial integrity. We talked today about the preparation of a new sanctions package against Russia. We talked about overcoming the food crisis provoked by Russia. The resumption of exports of Ukrainian agricultural products is vital for dozens of countries. And there is only one reason why the food crisis has become possible at all: Russia is to blame, and no one else. All leaders already recognize this. We talked about the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war - we have very specific views of partners on this. I believe that it is not a coincidence that the situation with gas in Europe has worsened today - the price has jumped again. Russia has done this on purpose, restricting supplies to harm Europe, to strike at Europeans. Gazprom is simply pulling on the gas chain in which they have been trying to shackle Europe for a long time. And this is another argument in favor of the fact that Europe must now switch to life without Russian gas. There should be no such dependence. Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow there will also be a lot of news for Ukraine, and I believe that they will be positive. I really believe that. I would like to emphasize once again that all this is possible first of all thanks to our heroes, thanks to each and everyone who protects us from Russian troops. Today, the Ukrainian army is fighting in the conditions of a significant quantitative advantage of the enemy - in technology, in artillery systems. Fighting in such conditions is a daily feat. We do everything to give our heroes modern and powerful weapons. And I am proud of all those who have been repelling the occupier and all the attacks for 113 days of the full-scale war already. It is thanks to the bravery of Ukrainian men and women that Europe can create this new history of freedom and finally remove the \"gray\" zone between the EU and Russia in Eastern Europe. Ukraine has come closest to the European Union since independence. Eternal glory to all who are fighting for Ukraine! Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by these occupiers! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President Pendarovski, Dear Presidents, Prime Ministers, Parliamentarians! Dear attendees! Friends! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you and leave my arguments for discussion at your important Forum. Now is a historic moment for Europe and European security, when everyone has to decide: what Europe is and what Europe will be like in the future. Will it be as free as it is now? Will it be as safe as most Europeans are used to? Will it be as socially and economically developed, inspiring societies outside Europe to change their way of life? Russia has challenged us all - every nation on the continent, every region of Europe. For Ukraine, this is the most dreadful military challenge, and we have been defending ourselves for 113 days already against Russia's ambition to destroy the Ukrainian people and our culture. Ukrainian cities destroyed by the Russian army; millions of migrants; hundreds of thousands of people deported by the Russian military; and tens of thousands of Ukrainians killed are all blatant manifestations of Russia's anti-European policy. By starting this war against Ukraine, Russia tried to create a springboard for an attack on other nations of Europe. That is why our defense in this war and our future victory are fundamentally important for the security of everyone in Europe. But in addition to this blatant manifestation of Russia's anti-European policy, there are many other manifestations of it. Smaller, but still very vile and destructive, openly aggressive. And I would like to draw your attention to the fact that today there is not a single country left in Europe that has not suffered from at least one of the many manifestations of Russia's anti-European policy. Ladies and Gentlemen! All of us in a democratic world have faced an unprecedented energy crisis. For many years, Russia has been creating the impression that it is allegedly a reliable supplier of energy resources. But in reality it managed to make different European countries dependent on it. And now, when Russia decided to wage a war to conquer European nations, it used this energy chain first. It specially provoked historically extremely high gas prices. It specially restricts gas supplies, blackmailing individual countries and Europe as a whole. It violates existing contracts – requires payment for gas in rubles and artificially limits the volume of supply. This pressure on the gas market, as well as the use of other instruments by Russia, has led to a significant acceleration of inflation. This simply would not be the case if Russia acted as a responsible supplier and did not want to create a crisis. An even worse scenario is being implemented in the food market. It provokes not only rising prices for basic foodstuffs, but also a new migrant crisis. Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports and strikes at our agro-industrial infrastructure cause deficits in important regional segments of the world food market. Ukrainian wheat, corn, sunflower oil and other commodities have been indispensable for global food stability. Russia knew where to hit to create this crisis. And it deliberately increases it prolonging the war against our state and refusing to make the Black Sea safe for navigation. Why is it doing this? So that a new migrant wave hits, in particular, your countries, as well as your neighbors in Europe. How many millions of refugees will there be in Europe if Russian policy causes famine in African and Asian countries? And if the shortage of products there and the price crisis provoke political chaos and the fall of governments? Will you then be able to pursue a consolidated policy? That's why Russia wants a food crisis. And I will mention another element of Russia's anti-European policy. Russia is perhaps the world's largest investor in propaganda - and not just for domestic audience. Russia spends billions of dollars a year to deceive foreign audience and to incite hostility. And the connection between propaganda and war is obvious: in the first months of this year, Russia's propaganda budget was tripled. I am sure that each and every one of you knows what propaganda tools have worked or are still working against your states. And this instrument of Russia has only one task: to make it worse. In particular, worse for you. Ladies and Gentlemen! That is why any serious discussion of the security architecture in Europe must be based on the need to free Europe from the chains of dependence that the Russian state has been creating for decades. Security is simply impossible without it, and it is the same for the north of Europe, for the south, for the west and for the east. That is why such sanctions are needed for anti-European policy of Russia, so that they will forever remember the price, including for the food crisis. The one who creates artificial famine must become a global outcast and suffer painful losses. This should be taken into account in the preparation of the seventh EU sanctions package. And we need to realize that sanctions packages have, in fact, become part of the continent's security architecture. They work for stability and peace - limiting Russia's ability to expand aggression. Europe's full energy independence is needed. Any ties with Russia that it uses to make money on Europe and pursue anti-European policy must be severed. There can be no trade with Russia - you should not give money to those who seek your destruction. And most importantly - we need to make the whole of Europe finally united. This is what Ukraine and your countries - the Western Balkans - are equally interested in. Full-fledged European integration of Ukraine, as well as full-fledged European integration of your states, is a historical strengthening of Europe and a complete dismantling of Russia's ability to beat us one by one. The EU-Western Balkans High Level Summit will take place shortly. I sincerely wish it will be successful for your states. And I am grateful to you for the support of Ukraine that you provide at various levels, so that this June will be successful for our country in relations with the EU. By answering us about our European perspective and by answering you about your European perspective, the nations of Europe and European politicians are answering questions about the future of Europe. These are the questions I voiced at the beginning of my address. What will Europe be like in the future? Will it be as free as it is now? Will it be as safe as most Europeans are used to? Will it be as socially and economically developed, inspiring societies outside Europe to change their way of life? We need a positive answer – to our and your European perspective. And I am grateful to you for working together on such an answer. I wish us all success! I wish us all victory! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! We are now one step from the beginning of full-fledged integration with the European Union. We have a positive conclusion from the European Commission on the candidacy for Ukraine. And this is a historical achievement of all those who work for our state. The only thing left is to wait for the decision of the European Council next week. And I believe that Ukraine has done everything possible for this step to be positive as well – the decision of the European Council, i.e. the leaders of the EU states. Ukraine deserves this positive. Ukrainian values are European values. Ukrainian institutions maintain resilience even in conditions of war. Ukrainian democratic habits have not lost their power even now. And our rapprochement with the European Union is not only positive for us. This is the greatest contribution to the future of Europe in many years. Let me remind you now only one thing: after February 24, our country acceded to the European energy system. Our networks - Ukraine and the European Union - work in sync despite a full-scale war. Hence, even this fact alone shows everything at once - the professionalism of our people, the strength of our institutions, our ability to fulfill promises and the magnitude of Ukraine's potential. And I want to emphasize that Ukraine's European integration is not something purely political, not something detached from the lives of ordinary people. On the contrary. The closer we are to other European countries, the more opportunities we will have to guarantee all Ukrainians a modern and prosperous life. I spoke today with Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. I thanked her and all members of the European Commission for their leadership and today’s decision. I also spoke with European Council President Charles Michel. We are coordinating our steps. And I am grateful to Charles for feeling the historical significance of these processes for both Ukraine and the future of Europe. Today I will also speak with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Rutte. I use every opportunity for our interests, for Ukraine. During yesterday's visit to Kyiv by the leaders of France, Germany, Romania and Italy, it was clear what far-reaching prospects are being opened both for our country and for all Europeans if we continue to work together. And today this understanding has become even clearer. European strength, European independence and European development can be imagined truly powerful only with Ukraine. It is interesting, by the way, how the course of history chooses the time for important decisions: the government of Ukraine abolished the agreement on visa-free regime with the Russian Federation today. Now the visa regime will be effective starting from July 1. It is difficult to overestimate the symbolism of what happened today. But no one picked the moment on purpose. This is what the course of history is. Russia itself has done everything to destroy any ties with Ukraine. Well, we are doing everything to make our ties with Europe as strong as possible. Boris Johnson visited Kyiv today. This is already the second visit of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to our capital since February 24. The negotiations are positive. We discussed the situation on the frontline and ways to achieve our victory. I am grateful to Boris for his leadership in supporting Ukraine, including with weapons. I am also grateful that we equally perceive the need for unconditional protection of our state. We talked about security guarantees for Ukraine. When we define the parameters of these guarantees, they will determine the future of Ukrainians and all Europeans for generations to come. In general, the week was maximally useful for Ukraine – in many areas. And I would also like to thank US President Biden today for increasing American support for Ukraine every week. And this week we have significant results on the front exactly due to the support of the United States. I have just signed new decrees on awarding our heroes. 413 combatants were awarded state awards, 29 of them posthumously. And finally. Today I can already announce this: we managed to liberate “Tayra”, Ukrainian paramedic Yulia Payevska, from captivity. I am grateful to everyone who worked for this result. \"Tayra\" is already home. We will keep working to liberate everyone. Eternal glory to all who stood up for our independence and our freedom! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you! Nightly, almost morning report. I am coming back from the south - visited today our frontline positions in the Mykolaiv region, visited Mykolaiv itself, and the Odesa region as well. I talked to our defenders - military, police, National Guard, territorial defense. Their mood is confident, and looking into their eyes it is obvious that they all do not doubt our victory. Thanked them for the service, for the protection of our state. Thanked the parents of such brave children. Really very strong. Presented awards to the best. Presented the Order of the Golden Star to the Hero of Ukraine Colonel Vadym Sukharevsky, commander of the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade. We will not give away the south to anyone, we will return everything that's ours and the sea will be Ukrainian and safe. Both in Mykolaiv, and in Odesa I held meetings with our military, with all officials who are responsible for defense and maintenance of these two regions. Listened to the reports on the destruction of the regions caused by Russian strikes. The losses are significant. Many houses were destroyed, civilian logistics were disrupted, there are many social issues. I have commissioned to make assistance to people who have lost loved ones more systemic. We will definitely restore everything that was destroyed. Russia does not have as many missiles as our people have the desire to live. Substantively discussed the economic situation, the work of the agricultural sector. Discussed the security of our ports and opportunities for the export of our agricultural products. Our position is clear and unchanged - as soon as we can ensure security through international mediation, Ukraine will do everything possible to counter the food crisis that broke out across the world – in Asia, Africa and most countries of the world – due to the Russian war. I visited city hospitals in Mykolaiv and Odesa. I thanked the doctors and nurses - they are our heroes. On the eve of the Medical Workers’ Day, I congratulated them on their professional holiday. I had a conversation with our defenders wounded in battles. Yesterday I signed a decree conferring the rank of Major General upon the Commander of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Tetyana Ostashchenko. Today I had the honor to personally congratulate Tetyana Mykolaivna on this rank. And I always say in my appeals on purpose – male and female defenders. I want all of us in Ukraine to always emphasize the contribution of both men and women to the defense of our state. My main impressions today are absolute pride in our people. I am proud of all those who defend the state! I am grateful to everyone who saves people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! There were many congratulations in our country today. June 19 is Medical Workers’ Day, Father's Day and Farmer's Day. Of course, today I would like to thank all our doctors, all Ukrainian nurses, who have been literally on the frontline since February 24. Thank you for the tens of thousands of second birthdays you gave to our military, our civilians, our Ukrainian children. Thank you for saving lives on the front, in hospitals across our country. Ukrainian doctors are countless examples of extraordinary heroism. Heroism of those who carried out surgeries under shelling. Who worked in the blockade in Mariupol. Who survived the occupation, captivity and even in such conditions, as much as possible, saved lives - the most precious thing. I would also like to thank our farmers today. Those who defended their communities even with bare hands when stopping the Russian military. Who, despite the war, ensured a sowing campaign. Those who were even nicknamed \"tractor troops\" when they were taking Russian trophy equipment from the battlefield. And now that Russia has blocked our exports through the Black Sea ports, the whole world has seen who Ukrainian farmers really are and what the work of our agricultural sector is worth. Of course, I would like to thank all the fathers in Ukraine. All those who raised their children as good, decent, brave people. People who defend the state and do everything to help their neighbors live through the war. The Ukrainian courage that inspires the world so much, the Ukrainian freedom that strengthens the whole of Europe are possible only because Ukrainian parents have raised such children. Children with an understanding of values, able to be true heroes. Tomorrow a truly historic week begins. A week when we will hear the answer from the European Union on the candidate status for Ukraine. We already have a positive decision from the European Commission, and at the end of the new week there will be a response from the European Council. I think it is obvious to everyone that since 1991 there have been few such fateful decisions for Ukraine as we expect now. And I am convinced that only a positive decision meets the interests of the whole of Europe. I will deliver new addresses this week, including to Europeans. I will take every opportunity to defend the European perspective for Ukraine, for each of us, and to gather new supporters for us. Obviously, we should expect greater hostile activity from Russia. Purposefully - demonstratively. This week exactly. And not only against Ukraine, but also against other European countries. We are preparing. We are ready. We warn partners. The occupiers are accumulating forces in the Kharkiv direction, in the Zaporizhzhia region. They struck at our fuel infrastructure again - they want to worsen the fuel situation. Of course, we will respond to this, too. Fierce fighting continues in Donbas. The Russian army uses the greatest number of artillery there, the greatest number of offensive forces. But Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Avdiivka, Krasnohorivka and other hot spots are holding on. Our people are like that. They are holding on. Our army is holding on. And I am grateful to everyone whose strength today means our victory tomorrow. Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Fights hard! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you so much, Mr. President! Thank you for all the kind words in support of Ukraine! For what has just been said, for what you and our friends have done for the strength of our state! Dear colleagues, friends! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am also grateful for the invitation, Mr. President Levits! I am grateful to you and I have the honor to address all present today. I will begin my address immediately with the key thing, given our precious time. I'll start with what we offer. First, Ukraine must be a participant in the Three Seas Initiative. It is wrong that our state remained outside the Initiative. We need to find a format in which we can implement the accession. Just one look at the geographical map of our region is enough to understand that it is only with Ukraine that all our countries can realize their full potential. Economic, infrastructural, potential of social ties between our countries, between our people and the historical basis of life in our region. Based on this, my second suggestion is to strengthen the interpretation of cooperation in the framework of the Three Seas Initiative. Every sphere we can work on together in this Initiative is really about security. And first of all it is logistics. Please look at the Ukrainian situation now: it is the states of the Three Seas that are our connection to the free world. The supply of weapons to Ukraine, the supply of fuel, the preservation of vital transport flows, green corridors for the export of Ukrainian food, the migration of people - all this works through the territory of the member states of this Initiative. In the same way, the Three Seas Initiative is destined to become an effective rear for any country in our region, if it is also - God forbid, of course - threatened by Russia. When the enemy comes, everything matters: roads, railways, ports, the energy system, speed at the borders, even the habit of working together. That is why it is our duty to deepen all connections in this space. It is these connections that are our security, after all. The third proposal is energy. Ukraine has one of the most powerful gas storage facilities in the region and an extensive gas supply network. Therefore, by cooperating with our neighbors, using the capacities of the Poland-Slovakia, Poland-Ukraine interconnectors, as well as the LNG terminals available in the region, we can meet the needs of all the countries of the Three Seas Initiative. Already after the start of a full-scale Russian invasion, we joined the European Union's energy system. And now our electricity exports can be a contribution to the energy balance of your countries, which will help you become completely independent of Russian energy pressure. The fourth suggestion is that we must do everything we can to make the Trans-European Corridor Via Carpathia work one hundred percent, connecting northern and southern Europe. Ukraine can play the role of one of the logistics centers. And we are ready to join Via Carpathia right now. We are ready to integrate into the European railway network, in particular through the Warsaw-Kyiv railway line and access to the Rail Baltica railway corridor. We must continue to work on expanding checkpoints on the borders of our state. Fifth proposal - Ukraine can support many infrastructure projects in the field of digitization and strengthen our regional digital ties. Keep in mind that the Ukrainian experience in combating cyber threats is truly unique and can be very useful for each of your countries. And the sixth proposal - participation in the project of reconstruction of Ukraine. This will be the largest economic project of our generation. Politicians often say that economic prosperity is the foundation of national security. And it really is. But not as often as they say, politicians manage to implement this principle. That is to make the economy so powerful that the state itself becomes powerful enough. Now we have such a historic chance. But only if we work together will we be able to use it. The Three Seas Initiative needs the potential of Ukraine. We are ready. We are willing. For the first time, Ukraine has been invited to participate in the Three Seas Initiative Summit today. I am grateful. However, you know - while this war is going on, I can't leave the state. So I can't be with you right now. But I am sure that you can now involve us in specific infrastructure projects, and will find a status that will allow us to participate in the activities of your Initiative. I believe it is possible! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Chairperson of the African Union, Dear Mr. Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Distinguished heads of state and government, Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for this opportunity to address you. Address you in a state of emergency, when we have a war. In an emergency for the whole world, when Africa is actually taken hostage. Hostage of those who started the war against our state. Yes, this is war. Russia's war against Ukraine. Not a crisis, not a conflict, as it is still defined sometimes. No, this is a war! A brutal war, a war of invasion. Russian troops have come to our land and want to conquer our people. This war may seem very distant to you and your countries. But catastrophically rising food prices have already brought it home to millions of African families. As well as to many families in Asia, Europe, Latin America. The unjust and provoked by the Russian war level of food prices is painfully felt on all continents. Unfortunately, this can become a particular problem for your countries. We need to take into account various factors - population growth on the African continent, the ongoing economic recovery after the pandemic, the lack of domestic financial resources in many countries to buy food at much higher prices. Given the physical shortage in the global market, some countries on the African continent find it particularly difficult to maintain the necessary food supplies. But why and when did this problem arise? I emphasize that such a problem did not exist on February 23 this year. It is true that unusual inflationary processes have already taken place in different parts of the world. Various countries have already sent huge sums of money to support the economy in the crisis through COVID-19. However, there was nothing like a food shortage. The crisis began on February 24, when the Russian fleet blocked Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The sea route is the main one for the agrarian sector of our state. And Ukrainian agricultural exports are one of the foundations of the stability of the global food market. Ukraine is one of the main suppliers of wheat, sunflower oil and corn. According to expert estimates, the lives of about four hundred million people in different countries of the world depend on the export of our food. And if it was not for the Russian war against Ukraine, there simply would be no shortage in the food market. If it was not for the Russian war, our farmers and agricultural companies could have ensured record harvests this year. If it was not for the Russian war, people in Africa, people in Asia and anywhere else in the world would not suffer from the catastrophic rise in food prices. There simply would not be such a catastrophic rise in prices. Ladies and Gentlemen! This situation shows how connected everything is in the world. One war in Europe, namely Russia's attempt to seize our land, to turn Ukraine into a Russian colony, has led to a deterioration in access to food and a growing threat of famine everywhere. Of course, we are defending ourselves, of course, we will defend our independence until we win this war. And, of course, we are already trying to build new supply logistics. Right now we have more than 25 million tons of grain in the elevators awaited by traditional consumers of Ukrainian products. We are establishing exports by rail and through the ports of neighboring countries, so that last year's harvest and this year's harvest could reach consumers. But much smaller volume can be supplied via new routes, and it takes much more time. This results in a much more expensive supply. We are holding complex multilevel negotiations to unblock our Ukrainian ports. But you see that there is no progress yet. Because no real tool has yet been found to ensure that Russia does not attack them again. That is why the food crisis in the world will continue as long as this colonizing war continues, Russia's war against our state, and as long as our ports are blocked. Ukraine was also one of the main European producers of fertilizers. And now production is virtually stopped - again because of the war. Some manufacturers do not have the raw materials and even the ability to work - due to the threat of Russian missile strikes and other consequences of hostilities. Some companies are already in combat zones and were simply destroyed by Russian troops. Have you heard about this from your Russian partners with whom you maintain contact? Did they tell you that? I'm sure they're telling you completely different things. But, in fact, they need this crisis. They are deliberately exacerbating it. Because they are trying to use you and the suffering of the people to put pressure on the democracies that have imposed sanctions on Russia. I emphasize that the sanctions policy is aimed only to stop Russia from trying to turn Ukraine into its slave. Ladies and Gentlemen! We all see that the existing architecture of global security and international organizations are not yet able to influence the aggressor state to end this war and restore international security. Did the UN Security Council work? No. Moreover, your voice in the UN Security Council - the voice of Africa - has not been fully heard. But in today's globalized world, a world without Africa and Africa without ties with the world are impossible. And it is right that the African Union conducts a principled activity, defending the interests of all the inhabitants of your continent. However, your voice should be strong enough in all international structures. And if they need to be reformed for that, including the UN Security Council, then we need to do so. That is why, for example, on April 5, in my address to the UN Security Council, I proposed to convene in Kyiv - of course, after this war and our victory - a global conference on UN reform and transformation. I also launched a new policy of Ukraine towards Africa. It was during my term that the first Strategy for the Development of Ukraine's Relations with African States was approved. Dialogue with all countries of the continent will be intensified. The Special Representative of Ukraine for African Affairs will also start working in the near future. I want us to fully understand one another and interact without intermediaries - for our common interests. And the fact that there are such interests is quite obvious after February 24. Because the stability of your countries depends on the stability in Ukraine and in our region. Pursuant to my instruction, the first regional tour of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to the states of Sub-Saharan Africa is being prepared. Of course, we also need to develop inter-parliamentary dialogue. To this end, I am initiating visits to African countries by representatives of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. I invite you to visit our country now to renew our bilateral ties. And I propose to start preparing, with our common willingness, a large political and economic conference \"Ukraine - Africa\". In many countries of the African Union, Ukraine is well known economically and in the educational sphere. In fact, our relationship is very old. Our specialists have been building enterprises in your countries in Soviet times. Your students have studied at our universities and are studying now. We have always contributed to the maintenance of peace on the African continent. Until February 24, more than 300 Ukrainian blue helmets performed tasks within six UN missions. And our national contingent, including the 18th Separate Helicopter Detachment, was an important part of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And it is on this basis of the relationship that has existed for many, many years that we must build a new political history. We can do it. We must free our people from the threats artificially created for us by any states that simply want to conquer us, use our resources and our land. And our number one task now is to finally get rid of the threat of famine. In the XXI century, such a threat simply cannot exist - thanks to Ukraine, thanks to our agricultural sector. We cover any deficits, we produce everything so that there is enough food for each of your countries, all consumers with whom we work. If it wasn't for the Russian war, you would be in a completely different position now - completely safe. That is why, in order to avoid famine, the efforts of states like Russia to return to the aggressive policy of colonialism must end. The time of empires is over! People have the right to just live, just live and have everything for life. Thank you very much for this opportunity to address you! Thank you very much for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you very much! First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Giampiero Massolo. I would like to thank you, dear Mr. Mario Monti, for inviting me. Just before I start, I would like to thank you for our students, for finding opportunities, for finding programs, for helping Ukrainians, temporarily displaced persons, our displaced students. This is our future, so we do not want to lose it and therefore we really want them to return to our homeland after receiving your warmth, knowledge, experience. Thank you again for saving our future, our students. Now I would like to address all the participants of the forum. Dear friends! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you today. Everything needs to be done today. And so it happened that today is World Refugee Day. Unfortunately, this day has recently become especially painful for all of us, for millions of Ukrainians. To be precise, for more than 12 million of our citizens. Imagine! Those who at the beginning of this year had a home, complete security, plans for the future. And all this was destroyed by the Russian invasion. More than 12 million Ukrainians have become migrants. They left their cities, communities and sought refuge in a safe area. Where at least Russian artillery does not reach. More than 5 million Ukrainians out of these 12 have left our country and found refuge in other countries, including Italy. I would like to thank once again all your people, your cities, your Government and Prime Minister Mr. Draghi for helping our people, especially our women and children. It is very important. But what is our goal now? What do I want to say today? We must do everything we can to ensure that Ukrainian migrants return home. No matter how many of them there are and wherever they seek protection, we must provide them with a real opportunity and internal interest to return to Ukraine. We can set a historical precedent. Earlier, when the aggressor started a war against another state, he hoped that the war would break the victim. And now we have proved that Ukraine cannot be broken. But this is not enough. That is why this is a key element - the ability of people to return home. Due to the Russian war against Ukraine, Europe is experiencing the biggest migrant crisis in decades. When else was it that 12 million people lost their home and security in just a few months? Only World War II comes to mind. Russia has deliberately created such conditions. Mariupol – almost half a million inhabitants. Different cities. Severodonetsk – 100 thousand inhabitants. Volnovakha – 22 thousand inhabitants. So it was. But Russia destroyed everything there. Artillery, aircraft, missiles - they did not spare tools. I can name hundreds of other cities that have already been destroyed. And I can name dozens of other cities that are still threatened by Russian strikes. Now the Russian army is trying to gather forces to attack Kharkiv again. We de-occupied this region. And they want to do it again, and we see it. And there are one and a half million inhabitants. Mykolaiv is constantly being bombed, with almost half a million inhabitants. They want to capture and completely destroy Slovyansk - there were 100 thousand inhabitants before the war. Of course, we will do everything possible to stop the occupiers, to protect the people. But to do it faster, we need support, modern weapons. Such weapons, which have potential greater than that of the Russian army. That is why I spend so much emotion, so much time and so much effort to convince all our partners to give us powerful weapons. It's a matter of lives. The second point is the economy. And as long as the war continues, as long as Russian missiles hit our cities, normal economic life is simply impossible. Up to half of our entire economy, up to half of our economic system is not working now. Imagine what it would be like if half of Italy's economy was completely blocked. Its industrial part and all your ports. No state can survive such a situation without financial assistance. And when we say that Ukraine needs about $ 5 billion a month to cover the budget deficit, it's not just a number, it's not about money. It's about how many millions of Ukrainians will still have something to live for. Live in Ukraine. The third point is reconstruction. We must do absolutely everything so that after our victory - I have no doubt about it - we would be able not just to restore normal living conditions in the areas where the Russian occupiers tried to leave only scorched debris, but to build a life so modern, so safe that it would affect the aggressor as well. That is, not only sanctions, not only the physical losses of the Russian army on the battlefield, but also the very fact of restoring life in Ukraine. Life itself is a priority. The very fact that we can rise from the ashes. And the aggressor state will remain with losses and degradation only. Our goal is for this migrant crisis in Europe caused unconditionally and solely by the Russian war to be truly the last such crisis. So that any other aggressor does not even think that with the help of war it will be possible to destroy the life of any European country. Weapons for Ukraine, financial support, the future reconstruction of our state - these are three elements that must work to the fullest. But that's not all we have to do. The Russian war against us has provoked a global food crisis. If it is not stopped immediately, our 12 million forcibly displaced persons will simply be a drop in the ocean of possible new migration flows. Before this speech, I have just addressed the representatives of the African Union - and I have placed an emphasis on this. On food security. Ukraine can supply food to the world market in the amount to meet the critical needs of dozens of countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Without our exports, there is a deficit, which can lead to chaos. Political chaos, economic chaos, migration chaos. And only this year we can do everything so that on the next World Refugee Day we will not have to discuss how to cope with tens of millions of migrants in Europe and in the regions bordering Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! It is a special moment now. A moment when the fate of millions of people depends on the decisions of European and world politicians. The moment when it is being decided whether peace will come to Ukraine soon. Therefore, it is being decided whether we will soon be able to say that we are already solving the problems I talked about today. And I urge you - be active! I am grateful to Italy for its principled position. But we need to do even more for Ukraine to win. I repeat - weapons for Ukraine, financial support and reconstruction of our state. Three elements that can change everything. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Step by step, we are going through a crucial week and we are doing everything every day so that no one has any doubts that Ukraine deserves the candidacy. We prove every day that we are already part of a united European, I would even say, value space. Now the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada have already left, and I am here. And you know, I'd like to thank them today. We often criticize them, but today they did a very good job. I am grateful to all our people’s deputies who supported our European integration. I would like to note the vote in favor of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. This Convention is often called the Istanbul Convention - according to the place of signature. It has been \"undermined\" in Ukraine for decades. But its main content is simple - it is the obligation to protect against violence and various forms of discrimination. I would also like to thank the deputies who supported the Law on Waste Management. This is an important environmental document. We have been struggling for it for three years. The law has been rejected several times due to oligarchic influence, and now it has been passed. Finally. Thank you. The Anticorruption strategy was approved today. This is also very important. I hope that the Rada will continue to work with the same significant results. I delivered four addresses today. The first was to the participants of the Three Seas Initiative Summit. It is a powerful regional association in Europe. 12 states between the Baltic, the Adriatic and the Black Sea. Before addressing, I spoke with President Duda. We coordinated our positions with Andrzej. And at the summit it was decided that Ukraine acquires a status that will allow it to become a full member of the Three Seas Initiative. For us, these are significant economic opportunities, modernization of transport, communications and networks. This is another line of close cooperation between Ukraine and the EU states. By the way, we have good news from our border with Poland. In the framework of the Open Border project, the capacity of the Krakovets’-Korczowa checkpoint has been increased by 50 percent. This will significantly increase the export-import flow across the border. Modernization awaits other checkpoints on the borders with the European Union. And it is tangible, and not only for us. Allows doing global things. Fighting the food crisis provoked by Russia's blockade of ports. I spoke about it in an address to the leaders of the African Union. I stressed that this crisis is artificial - it would not exist if it was not for the Russian war against us. I also stressed that we can ensure the supply of agricultural products in the amount that will definitely guarantee the security of Africa, the security of Asia. In general, we are expanding the capabilities of our state. Like all powerful European countries, we need our own policies towards Africa, Latin America, South-East Asia and other parts of the world that were previously left out of proper attention of Ukraine's foreign policy. We are working on the agency of Ukraine. I also addressed the participants of the Global Policy Forum in Italy. Very influential meeting. I talked about how to bring all Ukrainian migrants home. Today I met with Ben Stiller, a well-known actor and UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador who is engaged in providing assistance to displaced persons and refugees. I am grateful to Ben for his constant attention to the needs of Ukrainians. I met with President of the General Confederation of Italian Industry Carlo Bonomi. We talked about the ties between Ukrainian and Italian business. I am grateful for the opening of the Confederation's office in Kyiv. And the shortest, but very important address was made to the participants of the International Festival of Creativity in Cannes - the largest such event in the world. The Cannes Lions is a special audience. These are people who know how to control attention and who are very much needed in Ukraine right now. The longer the war lasts, the harder it is to compete for the attention of hundreds of millions of people in different countries. But I will do everything possible so that attention to Ukraine does not fade. I called on the most creative people in the world to be our allies in this. And I know that the response in Cannes was very positive. The next days of the week will also be busy. We are moving towards the main decision of the European Council, which will be adopted on Friday. As I predicted, Russia is very nervous about our activity. Again shelling of Kharkiv, Odesa, again attempts of brutal offensive actions in Donbas. This is an evil that can only be appeased on the battlefield. We are defending Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. This whole region is the most difficult, there are the hardest battles. But our strong boys and girls are there. The occupiers receive responses to their actions against us. I am grateful to the army and intelligence that provide it. In the evening I signed another decree on awarding our defenders. 220 combatants were awarded state awards. 27 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who defend our state! Glory to you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Greetings from Ukraine, Cannes Lions! These days I was on the frontline. Our brave soldiers, our brave defenders are fighting back against the Russian army. 117 days ago, everything changed for Ukraine. We are defending against a nuclear state that has unlimited access to money and has disregarded any limits on violence. I’ll be honest with you – the end of this war and its circumstances depend on the world's attention. And that's why I need allies. We need people like you. You are the most creative people in the world – always on the cutting edge. Whether it’s the Refugee Flag or the Fearless Girl, the Ice Bucket Challenge or the Rivers of Light – every time you find words and images to reach the depths of the human soul, you make people talk about issues everyone would otherwise overlook. I am sure that you will do a lot more to promote Ukrainian bravery. Your campaigns and your work will make our fight for freedom legendary. Because we are fighting not only for our own freedom but for the freedom of the entire democratic world; for all of those who cannot even imagine the extent of tyranny and censorship that exist in Russia. Now you can bring peace to Europe simply by applying your professional qualities. I believe that the power of human creativity is greater than the power of a nuclear state that is stuck in the past.  Speak of Ukraine! Don't let the world switch to something else! The world must remember that Ukraine is fighting for freedom. This fight must end in our victory as soon as possible. Your every success will mean saving thousands of lives. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a day of extremely active foreign policy activity - almost a marathon of phone conversations. We are increasing the number of those who stand for Ukraine’s candidacy and adding confidence that the decision on Friday will be positive. Slovakia. In a conversation with Prime Minister Heger, we coordinated our positions on the eve of the session of the European Council. Lithuania. I thanked President Nausėda for the decision of the Three Seas Initiative Summit to grant Ukraine the status of a partner-participant. We also coordinated our steps. Hungary. There was a very fruitful conversation with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. I invited him to visit Ukraine and thanked him for the important support for our sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. We agreed to develop cooperation in the energy sector. Portugal. We agreed with Prime Minister António Costa to involve his country's experience in our rapprochement with the European Union. Next - Denmark. I expressed gratitude for supporting Ukraine, including with weapons. I also noted the speech of Mrs. Frederiksen in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, which took place today. Spain. In a conversation with Prime Minister Sánchez I noted that our cooperation would strengthen both Ukraine and the entire European Union. The possible outcome of the NATO Summit in Madrid, which will take place in late June, was discussed. Ireland. I noted Ireland's active support for our European integration and invited Irish Prime Minister Martin to visit Ukraine. Croatia. I am confident that we can expand our cooperation both bilaterally and at the level of European structures. I thanked Prime Minister Plenković for his support of Ukraine. I was happy to see in Kyiv a great friend of our state - Prime Minister of Luxembourg Bettel. And I would like to draw your attention once again to the assistance from Luxembourg. 15% of the defense budget of this state – this was a contribution to the defense of Ukraine. Both the greatness and the nobility of the state are immediately felt. Today, Mr. Bettel visited the cities of the Kyiv region that had been liberated from the occupiers. I am grateful to him for his sincere understanding of our people and for Luxembourg's readiness to take part in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. My schedule for tomorrow is as busy as today. I will do my best to ensure that the historic decision of the European Union is adopted. This is important for us. By the way, today, without delay, I signed the law on ratification of the Istanbul Convention adopted yesterday. Protecting all people from violence and discrimination is our principle. In all negotiations, I always emphasize that the seventh package of the European Union sanctions is needed as soon as possible. Russia must feel a constant increase in pressure for the war and for its aggressive anti-European policy. Another Russian threat to Lithuania, another wave of energy pressure, another batch of lies from Russian officials about the food crisis are all arguments to agree on the seventh package of sanctions. The situation on the frontline is without significant changes. With the help of tactical moves, the Ukrainian army is strengthening its defense in the Luhansk region, which is really the toughest area right now. The occupiers are also putting serious pressure on the Donetsk direction. In the Kharkiv region there is brutal and cynical Russian artillery shelling. It will not give anything to the occupiers, but the Russian army is deaf to any rationality. It simply destroys, simply kills - in this way it shows its command that it is not standing still. In the south we defend our Mykolaiv region, our Zaporizhzhia, and gradually liberate the Kherson region. And just as actively as we fight for a positive decision of the European Union on the candidacy for Ukraine, we fight every day for the supply of modern weapons for our country. We do not decrease our activity for a single day. The lives of thousands of people depend directly on the speed of our partners - on the speed of implementation of their decisions to help Ukraine. Today I signed two major decrees on awarding our defenders. At the request of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 210 combatants were awarded, 3 of them posthumously. At the request of the Minister of Internal Affairs, 255 warriors of the National Guard of Ukraine were awarded, 41 of them posthumously, 41 border guards, 12 of them posthumously, and 45 policemen. And I want you to realize that when I talk about signing such decrees, it's not just a routine and not something mechanical. It is only thanks to the mass courage and wisdom of our people on the battlefield that Ukraine lives and can really count on victory. Eternal glory to all who fight for our state! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and gentlemen! Greetings from Kyiv! We are just days away from the European Union's historic decision on Ukraine. And I am sure that none of us – none of you – have any doubt that Ukraine should get a positive decision. We deserve it! And we deserve it not only for our bravery and our fight for freedom. Russia's attack on Ukraine has restored to our memory the worst pages of history. Russian bombs are destroying cities. Russian soldiers are killing thousands of civilians. Russia is even carrying out mass deportations of Ukrainians. What is this? This is Russia's attack against the whole free Europe – against our common values. Against human rights, the rule of law and conventions that protect everyone in Europe and the world. We will not allow to destroy our values! I believe that together we can end the war with our victory as quickly as possible and we will rebuild everything Russia has destroyed. United Europe is definitely stronger than any tyranny! Even during such a brutal war, Ukrainian democratic institutions have been preserved. Even now we are extending the reach of the European values – yesterday the Ukrainian Parliament ratified the Istanbul Convention. And no matter how much pressure Russia puts on us, we remain confident that Europe's future is bright and free, because we all stand together to protect it! I am grateful to all those who support us. Thank you for this sincerity, Amsterdam! Looking forward to a positive European decision for Ukraine! Embrace Ukraine, strengthen Europe!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! We are ready to amaze the world! I said these words in Toronto, at the Conference on Reforms in Ukraine, 3 years ago. Who could have imagined that 3 years later, the subtext and meaning of these words would undergo a \"large-scale reform”. 3 years ago, describing my vision of change in Ukraine, I gave the example of a team that you all know very well. This is the Toronto Raptors. 2019 NBA Champions. To win when no one expects that. To do the impossible by uniting. That's how I described our state goal and the common task of all Ukrainians. Who could have imagined that 3 years later it would sound completely different. Who could have imagined how big the difference would be between these times, between then and now, between the summer of 2019 and the summer of 2022. Those were different times. We strived for slightly different victories. We were building a slightly different state. A country of transparent institutions, equal and fair rules, successful and free people. Today, the walls of our buildings are \"transparent\" in the literal sense of the word - destroyed by Russian missiles and bombs. The rules of the game apply to everyone, but in a different sense. These are the rules of survival. They are equal, but not fair. Tough, cruel and simple. Shoot on the front, help in the rear. You hear an air alarm go down to the shelter. You hear the sound of enemy military equipment, stand up for the defense of your country. In 2019, I talked about peace in the east of Ukraine - a lot was said with Chrystia (Freeland - ed.) and Justin Trudeau - the liberation of Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea. We did everything possible for this, on all existing platforms, with the help of all existing diplomatic tools. Ukraine sincerely wanted and strived for this. But the other side wanted and strived for something else. We saw this \"something else\" in the morning of February 24. As a result, in 2022, Mariupol, Kramatorsk, Severodonetsk, Berdyansk, Melitopol and dozens of other cities and villages of Ukraine joined the words peace, liberation, Donetsk and Luhansk. We conducted the Crimea Platform. Today we are fighting back the aggression of the Russian Federation so that in the future there is no need to hold the Kherson Platform, the Mariupol Platform, the Kharkiv Platform and dozens of other platforms for the deoccupation of Ukraine's sovereign territories. Three years ago, my goal was a major infrastructure reform. Ukraine started the Large Construction. And it was impressive. Three years later, Russia launched a special military operation. We restored and created new roads, bridges, kindergartens, schools, hospitals, stadiums. Russia has been creating missiles and bombs all this time to destroy it all. Three years ago, in Toronto, I also talked about the restoration of Donbas. To do this, we gathered hundreds of investors and companies from around the world in Donbas and held a forum in Mariupol. Three years later, this city does not actually exist. It is erased from the face of the earth. In 2019, we talked about reconstruction in the east of Ukraine. According to preliminary estimates, this required about $ 10 billion. At the time, that figure seemed shocking. Three years later, it has grown exponentially, and now we need hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild. Now, in addition to the east, we are talking about the south, north, center and west of our country. Ukraine and Canada are separated by the ocean and 7 thousand kilometers, but there is a full mutual understanding between us. Ukraine and Russia are separated by a common border, but there is a huge abyss between us. In words, actions and most importantly - values. In 2019, I spoke about my dream country. About a state where the highest value is a person. In 2022, we are fighting against the aggressor whose highest value is weapons. My goal was large-scale digitization of Ukraine. And we became a State in a smartphone. The goal of Russia is large-scale occupation of Ukraine. And we became a country in army boots. A country in tanks, aircraft, ships. A country in trenches and shelters. Our way of life changed, but not our worldview. The path by which we are going to the goal changed, but the goal remained the same. Lecturers of our universities sometimes lecture their students from trenches, online, via Skype. Our teachers record video lessons and tasks for pupils in the subway, during the air alarm siren. Our servicemen can get married via Zoom without leaving the frontline positions. 3 years ago our goal was real decentralization. 3 years later the goal of Russia became “denazification” that no one understands. 3 years ago we spoke about capable local self-government. 3 years later we are talking about powerful territorial defense. Those were different times, but our goals remained the same. The only amendment is that to implement all this we are today fighting against the second army of the world. We are fighting for our future, our freedom, our land. Just as 80 years ago, during World War II. Today is a special day in Ukraine. The day when we recall the feat of our ancestors, express gratitude to them for our life and the opportunity to build a new Ukraine. The day of mourning and honoring the memory of the war victims, which we mark on June 22. Exactly on this day in 1941 the Nazis started bombing Kyiv. At 4 am. Those were different times, a different occupation, a different war, but our morale, striving for freedom, struggle and our goal haven’t changed. And on February 24, 2022, when Russian missiles hit Kyiv and the whole of Ukraine also at 4 am, we stood up for our country. Today, we are fighting for the future of our children and grandchildren, for their life and opportunity to build a new Ukraine. We have already amazed the world. We have united to do the impossible. We will definitely win, although no one expected that. For the sake of our peaceful, free and democratic future. And these will be different times. What exactly and how we will cover the path to them - I think we will discuss that today here. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Thank you for the meeting. Thank you for your support, Canada. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today, June 22, is the Day of Mourning and Remembrance of the Victims of War. That war. A war that was to remain forever in the history of the XX century and was never to be repeated. But it is repeated. Today there is no shortage of words that Russia did the same on February 24 as the Nazis did on June 22. Much has been said about this. And I want to add only one thing. Then 1418 days passed from the morning of the invasion to the defeat of the aggressor. We must liberate our land and achieve victory, but faster. Much faster. This is our national goal, and we must work to achieve it on a daily basis. Not only the state, but also every citizen - at the level at which it is possible. From the very morning I continued the telephone marathon for a positive decision on the candidacy for Ukraine. 11 leaders today. Bulgaria. I thanked Prime Minister of Bulgaria Petkov for supporting Ukraine and the development of the whole of Europe with our participation. Latvia. We discussed with Mr. Prime Minister Kariņš the cooperation between our countries, between Ukraine and the European Union, as well as our joint opportunities to protect Europe from the crises that Russia organizes, including the food crisis. Greece. I was glad to hear the words of sincere support for Ukraine. Mr. Prime Minister and I have the same vision of the historical significance of the decision that is expected from the European Council. Sweden. Prospects for bilateral cooperation and cooperation at the level of European structures were discussed with Prime Minister Andersson. Estonia. Thanked Mrs. Prime Minister Kallas for her continued support of Ukraine. The priorities of our cooperation and the agenda in the context of the NATO Summit in Madrid next week were discussed. Czech Republic. Fruitful conversation with Mr. Prime Minister Fiala. The priorities of the Czech presidency of the Council of the European Union in the next six months were discussed. And now I am sure that the voice of the Czech Republic is in favor of Ukraine. Belgium. I thanked Mr. Prime Minister De Croo for supporting our European perspective and invited him to visit Ukraine. I hope that Belgium will take a significant part in the post-war reconstruction of our country. Austria. I am grateful to Chancellor Nehammer for the political and humanitarian support, for understanding the needs of Ukraine. We can do a lot to develop relations between our states. Slovenia. We agreed with Mr. Prime Minister Golob that we can strengthen cooperation between our countries. I thanked him for the consistent support of the candidacy for Ukraine. Moldova. I spoke with President Sandu. We supported each other on the eve of an important meeting of the European Council. And we will help each other to complete this path to the European Union faster. Today I spoke again with President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda. I expressed full support to him over the situation around the Kaliningrad region of Russia. Tomorrow I will continue this marathon - we must provide maximum support to our state. We expect a key European decision tomorrow night. The occupiers struck at Mykolaiv, seven missiles. Fortunately, no one was killed. Five people were injured. There were strikes at the Kharkiv region as well. There are casualties. There were strikes at the borders of the Chernihiv and Sumy regions. In Donbas there are massive air and artillery strikes. The goal of the occupiers in this direction remains the same - they want to destroy the whole Donbas step by step. Entire. Lysychansk, Slovyansk, Kramatorsk - they aim to turn any city into Mariupol. Completely ruined. That is why we repeatedly emphasize the acceleration of weapons supplies to Ukraine. Parity is needed on the battlefield as soon as possible to stop this devilish armada and move it beyond the borders of Ukraine. I am grateful to the United States for its assistance in investigating war crimes in Ukraine. I am grateful to Mr. Eli Rosenbaum for his willingness to join in the establishment of justice - he is one of those American investigators who managed to expose many Nazis. Our joint investigation team must be as strong as possible so that none of the Russian criminals avoid punishment. And this will be one of the largest contributions to the protection of international law and order of our time. Just as September 1, 1939 and June 22, 1941 ended in Nuremberg trials, February 24, 2022 must end in a fair tribunal. Russia must be held accountable for all the evil it has brought to Ukraine. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 195 combatants were awarded state awards, 17 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by the occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! We are preparing for the historic decision of the European Council, there are only a few hours left. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear students! Dear lecturers! Dear attendees! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for this opportunity. It is an honor for me to address you today. You know, to be honest, I have inquiries - a lot of them - from Israel, in particular from journalists. And I very often disagree. And not just me, frankly speaking. I love your country very much, so I will be honest. I reject these inquiries because, to be honest, sometimes I don't know what to say to people. I have often been to Israel, and it is sometimes difficult for me to respond to such inquiries. Why? I think you will understand me when you hear my address. And I think you will draw your own conclusions. You are smart and independent people. So, if it wasn’t for the war, I could visit your wonderful university and talk to you directly with pleasure. But since the beginning of the full-scale invasion by the Russian Federation on February 24, 2022, I remain in Ukraine, in our capital, in Kyiv. The Office of the President of Ukraine is located in the heart of the city. And if you visit Kyiv, you will definitely come here as well. Also, I'm sure you will visit some other places in our capital, in our country. If you walk literally 5 minutes down the street from the building where I am now, you will reach the street where the house of Golda Meir’s family was located - one of the most famous, great Israeli women in the world. She was born in Kyiv. I think you know that. And if you spend some more time and walk the streets next to the one where Mrs. Golda Meir lived, you will see the area that Sholem Aleichem, a prominent Jewish writer, liked so much. You will see the addresses where he lived, the houses next to which he felt cozy, and the museum dedicated to him. Kyiv, like many other cities and communities in Ukraine, is full of such places. Places of remembrance for both Ukrainian and Jewish nations. Places that connect us - and it's not just historical. It's not just plain facts. It is a space of real life of real people, which has forever united our cultures. This is the life in which there is one of the founders of the State of Israel Yitzhak Ben-Zvi and Waldemar Haffkine - one of the most remarkable scientists in human history, who created the first vaccines against plague and cholera. These are the great musician Vladimir Horowitz and the great physicist Abram Joffe. This is Vladimir Jabotinsky, whose mind was so interesting and whose life was so important that his publications are still read today; and this is Natan Sharansky, a politician of the time closer to us, whom we all know well, I personally know him, we all know in both our countries. Of course, these are places of faith without which it is impossible to imagine your culture. In particular, in our city of Uman, which annually received tens of thousands of Hasidic pilgrims. Or in Medzhybizh, where Baal Shem Tov is buried. Of course, these are places of sorrow that all mankind must remember and not forget. The Babyn Yar – a symbol of the Holocaust from bullets, the Drobytsky Yar and other such places on the land of then occupied Ukraine, where the Nazis killed innocent people. We remember all this, we preserve all this. And all this is now under threat. Because how can the places of remembrance be preserved in a total war for the destruction of everything living? Tomorrow, June 24, it will be four months since Russia has launched a full-scale war against Ukraine. And I am sure that each and every one of you has seen that this is a tragedy, has seen what kind of war it is at all, and how Russia is waging it. It destroys our cities. It totally burns down everything in the way of the Russian army or devastates the occupied territories. The main Russian weapons are artillery, air bombs, and cruise missiles. The occupiers do not try to think how to fight. Their tactics are very primitive. They use the maximum of bomb and artillery capabilities so that there is simply nowhere to resist. The Russian army fires missiles at Ukraine every day and every night. The vast majority of them are aimed at ordinary non-military facilities - residential buildings, enterprises, infrastructure, civilians. As of this morning, 2,709 missiles have already been used against Ukraine. And given the pace of their use, very soon the total number will reach 3,000 missiles. These are not unsophisticated missiles. Yes, there are obsolete, Soviet missiles among them, even those of the 1960s. But there are also modern ones. However, there is no selectivity in strikes for Russian missiles, bombs and artillery. That is why, for example, the Menorah in the Drobytsky Yar, which stands there in memory of the Holocaust victims, was also damaged by Russian shelling. They even fired at the Menorah! And should I tell you how many educational facilities the Russian army destroyed in Ukraine? Now you are in one of the wonderful universities, but it is one university - it is very good, but it is one. And imagine 2,000 destroyed educational institutions. How many people are there? Two thousand institutions! Who do you have to be to strike at a university, school or kindergarten with artillery? Russia has become a terrorist state. That's it. I'm sure you all know what the Russian army did to our city of Mariupol. In fact, this city no longer exists. And just four months ago, half a million people lived there. Now there are tens of thousands left in the scorched ruins. And they are threatened by infections that are simply impossible to imagine in today's world. In particular, an infection of cholera that Waldemar Haffkine fought against a hundred years ago. Mariupol is a city where now, week after week, the Russian occupiers are hiding traces of crimes, burying the remains of murdered people in mass graves. The Russian army did the same to Volnovakha and dozens of other towns and villages in Ukraine. And what is happening in the territories where the occupiers managed to enter quickly? Civilians are executed there, refugees are killed on the roads. People are tortured there. People are raped there, including minors - both girls and boys. The Russian troops have set up \"filtration camps\" in which people are tormented. Thousands were killed or mutilated in such camps. The occupiers carry out deportation of Ukrainians to Russia, scattering them in remote regions. And only a few manage to return to Ukraine through the territory of third countries. The number of forcibly displaced persons in our country in just four months is more than 12 million people. 12 million people! Nowhere in Europe in 77 years since World War II has there been anything similar to what Russia has done. Well, tell me how is it possible not to help the victim of such aggression? I ask you this question because I know that you do care, as well as millions, tens, hundreds of millions of people on our planet. So, I will return to where I started my address, to why I rarely, really rarely communicate with journalists when there are inquiries from Israel. I think you will understand. It's difficult for me. I do not know what to say to these distinguished persons. I do not know how to answer the questions I often hear. The questions: what help did Israel provide? And how else can we help? All journalists from all countries ask such questions. I just don't know what to say. Of course, I am grateful to the people of Israel, I am grateful to you for the sincere and emotional support for Ukrainians. I am grateful for all the Ukrainian flags that appeared on your streets - we see it all, we appreciate it all. For all the words that sounded in our support in your society. I am grateful to your great people. But we would like to get support from your government. It seems fair to me. For example, the geographically small state of Luxembourg, with a population of around 600,000, has provided us with defense support in the amount of 15% of its defense budget. The Baltic states - small, neighboring states - provided significant help when they sent us the necessary weapons. Maybe it was not much, but they gave us almost everything since the beginning of the Russian invasion. What about Israel? We understand that it is not easy for you, but we would very much like to write down in that column in front of your state in the tables about the assistance to our army - what we received. We would like to write something down there. We can also look at Poland. This state - like, by the way, the Baltic states - is under direct Russian military threat. It provides us with vital logistical assistance, it sheltered two and a half million Ukrainian migrants fleeing the war. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Denmark and many, many other countries shelter our people... Democratic countries - everyone did their best to shelter Ukrainian families - we are grateful to them. Most are women with children. They were fleeing the war, seeking refuge. Ireland, with which our culture has no such deep ties as with the culture of Israel, the people of Israel, the history of Israel, has even abolished the visa regime for Ukrainians so that they can simply come and save their lives and their children. Japan, Canada - they made it easier for us to enter. And the Israeli government has suspended the visa-free regime. This is happening right now. I do not want to judge that, I have no right. I have absolutely no right. This is the choice of each and every state. I just want you to think about it yourself. As for sanctions. When countries around the world impose sanctions on Russia, it's not about money, it's not about business. It's about values. It's about general security. It is about the fact that anyone who wants to destroy another nation must be held accountable. Japan - supported, Australia, the United States - many countries and many European states are working together - with us against Russian aggression. And, unfortunately, we have not yet seen Israel join the sanctions regime. However, I would like to thank you for the medications you sent to our country. Unfortunately, I have nothing to say about most of the items of the necessary assistance from Israel to Ukraine. Of course, we have such a situation with several states. It's true. But I can't tell them what I'm telling you. Why? Please remember our ties! How close we are. And how we should understand each other. And how we feel that your society understands these needs. I do not know why there is such a situation and misunderstanding with some government officials. That is why I have decided to tell you this today - I am not indifferent to the future relations between our states and nations. That's why I'm telling you this openly - face to face. I am sure that the war will end. We will win this war. And we have a common future. The great future of great nations, because we have such a great history, a great past. We will have to look each other in the eyes for many, many years to come. Especially your generation, because students are the future and it's wonderful. That's why I composed my address this way. So that you can draw conclusions and so that we can hear each other. With great respect for the history of Israel, for the people of Israel, for all of you. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Greetings to all our friends, all leaders-friends of Ukraine! Greetings to all who support freedom! That is how I began my address to the European Council on March 24, three months ago, when I urged you to support us. And that’s quite a path we have come in these three months! All of us together: Ukraine, your states and the European Union as a whole. This path is not politics. I believe this is what will always be the starting point of Europe's new history. Europe without division. Europe without \"gray\" zones. Europe that is truly united and that knows how to defend itself, its values, its future. Today you have adopted one of the most important decisions for Ukraine in all 30 years of independence of our state. However, I believe this decision is not only for Ukraine. This is the biggest step towards strengthening Europe that could be taken right now, in our time and in such difficult conditions, when the Russian war is testing our ability to preserve freedom and unity. On the fifth day of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, we applied to join the European Union. We provided extremely fast and high-quality answers to the questionnaire we received from the European Commission. And here is the desired result today. Today, I would like to reaffirm that Ukraine is capable of becoming a full-fledged member of the European Union. Then, three months ago, I addressed each country of the European Union and indicated at what stage we were, as I thought, in our relations. And today I would like to tell each and every one of you personally what our people feel, and in the same order as it was then. Lithuania stands for us. Thank you, Mr. President! Gitanas, you know how grateful Ukraine is to your people and to you personally. Latvia stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I believe that together we will be able to strengthen the international legal order. Estonia stands for us. Thank you, Mrs. Prime Minister Kallas! By helping one, we help everyone. Estonia has done a lot. Poland stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! Your state, your people, your President - all of you on this path to Europe are truly brothers with us. France stands for us. Thank you, Emmanuel! You can be sure that with Ukraine, Europe will really be able to be among the global leaders in the XXI century. Slovenia stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I am grateful for the unwavering protection of the common European cause. Slovakia stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! We have to continue to protect each other, it makes us really strong. The Czech Republic stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I believe that we will also be together on the path to Ukraine's full membership in the EU. Romania stands for us. Thank you, Mr. President! Klaus, our cooperation in the region and in European structures can indeed become one of the foundations of global stability. Bulgaria stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! Thank you for choosing the side of good in the confrontation that began on February 24 without hesitation. We know it's not easy for you. Greece stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! And I’m personally thankful to the Greek people, your country, which I really love. Germany stands for us. Thank you, Olaf! Thank you for your support at a crucial moment. Portugal stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! Your country knows our people well. And I am sure that we will only increase positive ties between us. Croatia stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! And thank you for the help with the experience we use to protect our freedom. Sweden stands for us. Thank you, Mrs. Prime Minister! Blue and yellow truly always stand together! Finland stands for us. Thank you, Mrs. Prime Minister! Your willingness to resist aggression is simply amazing! The Netherlands stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! You can be sure that your choice of Ukraine will definitely strengthen our common European freedom, the rule of law and our unity in diversity. Malta stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! The voice of your island makes the European community complete. Denmark stands for us. Thank you, Mrs. Prime Minister! Be sure that the protection of European values will only increase with Ukraine. Luxembourg stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! We truly understand each other, and your energy inspires us to future victories. Cyprus stands for us. Thank you, Mr. President! Thank you for the choice in favor of our people and our values. Italy stands for us. Thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister! Thank you for your strength, for your perseverance. Thank you for proving that the principles of decent people are truly the foundation of Europe. Spain stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I believe that we can significantly strengthen our relations. Belgium stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! We hope that after our victory we will be able to see each other often in Brussels on common European affairs. Austria stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Chancellor! I am convinced that we will be able to make Europe even safer and historically the most stable. Ireland stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! This is a historic rapprochement of our nations. Your personal leadership is truly impressive. Hungary stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you, Viktor, together we are capable of much more than alone! Mrs. President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola! We are grateful to you personally and grateful to the European Parliament! You were the first to support Ukraine's candidate status the day after our application. Mr. President of the European Council, dear Charles, Mrs. President of the European Commission, dear Ursula, I am grateful to you both for the leadership that has led us all to this day. I am grateful for the sincere help, for the faith in Ukraine, in Ukrainians, in all of us. I have always said that we, Ukrainians, believe in the European Union. Although we remained formally outside the European Union, our country probably had the largest number of flags of a united Europe. They were in the hands of our people during the revolutions. They have been in the hands of our people in the trenches since 2014. I believe that the flag of the European Union will be in every Ukrainian city that we have yet to liberate from the occupation of the Russian Federation. Ukrainian and European flags will also be together when we will be rebuilding our state after this war together. And today in the framework of our joint meeting – the summit of all European leaders, I would like to express special gratitude to our heroes - each and everyone who defends the independence of Ukraine with weapons in their hands, defends the freedom of Europe. Thank you! Thank you for making possible a new history of Ukraine, a new history of Europe - even stronger, even freer. Thank you all so much! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Fellow citizens of Ukraine! Dear Ukrainian people! 120 days ago, Russia launched a full-scale war against us. For 120 days, Ukraine and its people have heroically been defending their land and their freedom. They are fighting back one of the largest armies in the world. The aggressor, whose population is three times larger than ours, and the area is almost 30 times bigger. Therefore, each of the 120 days of our struggle is historic. But this day is special. Ukraine has officially received the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. We have heard many statements from many politicians over the years about the course to Europe and the strategic importance of this course. We are not politicians, and we do not have many years, so we have moved from statements to action. From dreams to action. And on February 28, Ukraine applied for EU membership. On Bankova Street, in the Office of the President of Ukraine, in the middle of fortifications and sandbags, in the pauses between the sirens of the air alarm, we signed a document. Many people were skeptical, and considered Ukraine's chances illusory. But we all united. Ukraine united. And the world saw our unique feature: the less they believe in us, the better we perform. Instead of thousands of words, thousands of slogans about moving to the EU, we filled in thousands of pages of the European Commission's questionnaire. What other countries spend a few years doing, we did in a few weeks. At the summit in Brussels, the leaders of the 27 EU member states adopted an official decision: Ukraine receives the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. And today I want to give a series of answers honestly, clearly and comprehensively for everyone. Fill in our questionnaire. Explain in human language what exactly happened and why it is so important. What does this mean for us and what does this mean for Ukraine? What does this mean and what does it give to Europe? What next? What will we do? What do our partners expect from us? What do we expect from partners? What do we expect from you as a society? And why will we definitely succeed? First, candidate status is not just a new step. This is a new summit. Not a new paragraph, not a new page or even a new section. This is a new volume in the history of Ukraine's European integration, which we started writing today. And as of today, this book has no other options but one: Ukraine will become a member of the EU in the future. As of today, this is fixed at the official level. Candidate status is a mandatory step that most countries have gone through. This is a point of no return. It's not just a new name or a new sign. This is a new status and a new image. Today it is recognized: Ukraine is not a bridge, not a pillow between the West and Russia, not a buffer between Europe and Asia, not a sphere of influence, not a \"gray\" zone, not a transit territory. Not the border between orcs and elves. Ukraine is a future equal partner for at least 27 EU countries. Chairman of The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk: EU candidate status is a recognition of our achievements in becoming a mature democratic European society. The strengths of our institutions that continue to work effectively even in times of full-scale war. This is a powerful political message. It will be heard by soldiers in the trenches, every family that was forced to flee the war abroad, everyone who helps bring our victory closer. But it will also be heard in the bunker. We can't change geography. Russia will continue to be our neighbor. But that decision has changed history. And in this case, history has defeated geography. Behind us is a column of Magdeburg law. It was installed in the place where Volodymyr the Great christened Kyivan Rus’-Ukraine. Hundreds of years later, this column was fortified with protective shields against Russian bullets and shells. It is an eloquent symbol of how they want to destroy our culture, our faith, our law. Our history. But history will win. The future will win. Ukraine will win. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal: Candidate status is a high evaluation of the market transformations that have enabled us to integrate into the EU economy in the energy, digital, customs, transport and other key sectors. These are new perspectives and new opportunities for Ukraine. Access to new EU financial support programs. These are new investments, new projects, new jobs, and support for post-war reconstruction. From now on, our state not only will adopt the European experience, but also will be able to influence the formation of sectoral policies of the European Union. From now on, the process of Ukraine's integration into the EU has become irreversible. From now on, Ukraine has a legal place in the European family. And relations between us and the EU are moving from the neighborhood policy to the enlargement policy. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Even simpler. In the plane of not political, but human relations. Obtaining candidate status is an engagement. A serious step in the relations between Ukraine and the EU. This is not just friendship, not sympathy, but a firm and official intention to become one in the future. In the near future. And as of today, Ukraine will be able to join the work of certain bodies and new EU programs, access to which is limited to third countries. Today we have got rid of this humiliating definition. Ukraine has never been like that in essence, but the official terminology called us that. We got rid of it. We are not a third country. Not a tenth, not a hundredth, we are a future member of the European Union. Today is an important day. We hear the Ode to Joy. Joy, but not euphoria. There is a lot of work ahead. The work of everyone in their place. The cohesion of all branches of government and society is our key to success. Despite the war, we continue to implement EU legislation, norms and rules in all spheres of life. The government will develop an appropriate roadmap. The next steps are known - we have the recommendations of the European Commission. We expect the Verkhovna Rada to approve European integration laws as a matter of priority. We expect all of you to have high civic consciousness, devotion to our values and awareness that no one will build us a European Ukraine, except us. I would like to emphasize a very important point. We are changing Ukraine for ourselves, not for someone else. We are implementing reforms not because of someone's demands, but because of our own beliefs. Ukraine seeks not to join, but to return to the European family. In 2014, the Ukrainian people withstood and defended its European future. But it has chosen it much earlier. Because democracy existed here more than a thousand years ago. In the days of Kyivan Rus’, when people joined in solving important issues in veche. Human rights, human life have already been valued a thousand years ago. Kyivan Rus’ is probably the only medieval state where there was no death penalty. 700 years ago there was a widespread legal system of local self-government. 700 years ago Ukrainian cities already had the Magdeburg law. Historians say that the borders of Europe are the outskirts of the last eastern city, which has the Magdeburg law. It did not take root further than the east of Ukraine. 500 years ago, our ancestors chose their own leaders. Hetmans of Zaporizhzhia and Kish otamans were not appointed by the king, tsar, boyars, nobility or aristocracy, but were elected freely and equally by all Cossacks. For centuries, our people have been committed to the principles of tolerance and respect. Hundreds of national communities and representatives of all religious denominations have lived and still live in peace and harmony on our land. Today Ukraine is fighting for its freedom. And this war began just when Ukraine declared its right to freedom. To its choice of its future. We saw it in the European Union. No matter how someone convinced us that no one wanted us there and a happy tomorrow for Ukraine was possible in a completely different union called Customs. And no matter how surprised they were that Ukrainians prefered freedom over cheap gas. We have chosen the path. The path determined by our people, not someone's power. Chosen by Maidan Nezalezhnosti, not Red Square. The path the Revolution on Granite fought for in 1990, the Orange Revolution stood on barricades for in 2004 and the Heavenly Hundred gave lives for during the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. It was then that the voice of Ukraine sounded loudest. It was there that we firmly chose our path. That is why the Russian Federation appeared on it, annexing Crimea, occupying part of Donbas and later starting a full-scale war against the whole of Ukraine. And that is why this decision of the EU is so important, motivates us and shows: all this is needed not only by us. Having declared our desire to go to the EU, today we finally heard clearly: we are waiting for you! You are welcome! We want to see you as a full member of our family. Hence, all this was not in vain. And our struggle continues not in vain. Ukraine has truly united. Ukraine is truly fighting. Ukraine will definitely win. Truly! Ukraine. Europe. World. Humanity. Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the Heroes!"

  "speech": "Greetings, Glastonbury! The festival resumes this year after a two-year break. The pandemic has put on hold lives of millions of people around the world, but has not broken. We, in Ukraine, would also like to live the life as we used to and enjoy freedom and this wonderful summer. But we cannot do that because the most terrible has happened - Russia has stolen our peace. But! We will not let Russia’s war break us. And we want to stop the war before it ruins people's lives in other countries of Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America – they are all under threat now. That is why I turn to you for support! Glastonbury is the greatest concentration of freedom these days. And I ask you to share this feeling with everyone whose freedom is under attack. Spread the truth about Russia’s war! Help Ukrainians who are forced to flee their homes because of this war. Find our United24 charity platform. And put pressure on all the politicians you know to help restore peace in Ukraine. Time is priceless, and every day is measured in human lives. The more people join us in defending freedom and truth, the sooner Russia’s war against Ukraine will end. Prove that freedom always wins! Thank you."

  "speech": "Good evening, great people of our state! Today was marked by a discussion of the historic decision of the EU Summit - granting Ukraine candidate status. Since this morning and until this moment, there is a dialogue on television, radio, on the Internet about what it means, what conditions Ukraine has to fulfill, how difficult it will be to fulfill and how many years it will take… And I want to say the following on this day. Let's rejoice at least a little. In a quiet, modest way, silently, but rejoice. For ourselves, for our beloved state. Let's feel the moment and the taste of this moment. Imagine conquering Everest. You reached the penultimate point. You didn't look around, didn't even take a breath and talk about the further way to the top. How difficult it will be to overcome the last 1848 meters. Instantly we forgot and devalued our own success. Maybe we should first recall that we have already covered 7,000 meters?! Let’s not be ashamed to talk about our achievements. Let’s not be a nation with a short memory and inferiority complex. We say: Ukraine has been granted EU candidate status. Let's say: Ukraine has gained EU candidate status. Did it fall from the sky? Haven’t we endured and done a lot? Today we focus on seven EU requirements. Yes. It's true. But does it scare us? No. Because before that we successfully fulfilled hundreds. Let's not forget about it. Not for bragging, but for the belief that we will definitely overcome this path. We have covered 7,000 meters, so we will not stop - we will reach our Everest. Let's talk at least for a moment not about what awaits us, but about what we managed to do. Because, forgetting about it, we underestimate the significance of this step. There were times when we couldn't take tickets in the evening and fly to Europe in the morning. We stood in line. Documents, visas, etc. Remember? A pile of papers that we carried in the file, which were required by all government agencies with officials who did not report to us and did not submit electronic declarations. High-ranking officials, for the control of which there was neither a special body nor a special court. Deputies with immunity. President who could not be impeached. Land that could not just be bought. Sounds wild? It seems it wasn't with us, doesn’t it? It was. And not so long ago. But we changed everything. Privatization. Land reform. Open-list voting. Decentralization. NACP, Anticorruption Court, administrative services centers, public services online. Diia. Split. Unbundling. Concession. Common aviation space. Industrial visa-free regime. Deoligarchization. Much has been done. Exactly done! Let's not forget that. Let's be proud of ourselves. Respect ourselves. And we repelled the Russians. And we will win. Because when we respect ourselves we will be respected by others. Do not rejoice at a slap in the face of Moscow, but be proud of applause for Ukraine. And that's why I want to see us in one family. Let it inspire you. We deserved it. Realized it. Smile, please. And may God give us all a quiet night. Well, tomorrow is the battle again. With new strength. With new wings. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I would like everyone to hear me today. We are free people and free countries! And this is forever. I am grateful to the sons of Georgia who are fighting against Russia together with our warriors. Their exploits are our common exploits. Their wounds are our wounds. And our victory will be the victory of each of them, each of you! We will never give up, because Donbas and Crimea are our land just as Abkhazia and South Ossetia are your land. And even if someone wants to forget about it, if someone wants to erase it, we will definitely remind them of it. We will stand by you! Yesterday, Ukraine became a candidate for EU membership. You are on this path. Act! We will help you! Ukraina da saqartvelo ertad, mudam! dideba saqartvelos! dideba ukrainas! And even if my Georgian was not perfect now, my thoughts are pure. I wish you success! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! 45 Russian missiles over the night and morning of today. Zhytomyr region, Lviv region, Chernihiv region, Mykolaiv. In the evening - more missiles. Different types, different launch areas... All of them were launched with one goal - to show that Russia allegedly can achieve something, that the Russian army will allegedly succeed. Today marks the fifth month of a full-scale war. The occupiers were going to capture most of our country on the fifth day, but have to stage such a missile show on the fifth month, which does not change anything strategically for Russia. This is such a phase of the war - morally difficult, emotionally difficult. When we know that the enemy will not succeed, when we understand that we will still be able to defend our state, but we do not feel the time limits of this, we do not feel how many more strikes, losses, efforts will be before we see that victory is already on our horizon. For this, Russia needs these missile strikes at cities across the country, artillery and mortar shelling of the border areas of our state, the border areas of the Chernihiv, Sumy regions, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk region. It is not just the destruction of our infrastructure, it is also a very cynical, calculated pressure on the emotions of our people. But it's not us who will be overpowered, we will overpower them. No Russian missiles, no strikes can break the morale of Ukrainians. And each of their missiles is an argument in our negotiations with partners. I will take part in the G7 Summit on Monday. The NATO Summit will take place next week. 45 missiles in half a day and just on the eve of such meetings. All clear. Another confirmation of our position. This confirms that sanctions packages against Russia are not enough, that Ukraine needs more armed assistance, and that air defense systems - the modern systems that our partners have - should be not in training areas or storage facilities, but in Ukraine, where they are now needed. Needed more than anywhere else in the world. And one more thing that should be said today after such a missile attack. In the four months of the war, more than 20,000 Ukrainian warriors were awarded state awards. More precisely, 20,463. These are the Armed Forces, the National Guard, border guards, our rescuers, police, intelligence, Security Service, our doctors, State Security Administration, State Special Communications Service, NABU special forces, State Bureau of Investigation and employees of the Judicial Security Service... 156 warriors were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. This is the scale of courage, this is the level of resistance. And if there are more than 20 thousand of those whose feat has already been awarded, what kind of missiles can anyone in Russia hope for? What artillery, what mines can help the occupiers, if they are really opposed by mass people’s resistance? Therefore, all our cities: Severodonetsk, Donetsk, Luhansk - we will return everything. Every week we go to Kherson. Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar and Mariupol were never forgotten. And all other cities of Ukraine that are temporarily occupied will be Ukrainian only. Thanks to our heroes, thanks to each and everyone who does not get tired, who does not succumb to emotional breakdowns, who struggles and who knows that victory is ahead. Our victory, only ours. Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Unbreakable people of an unbreakable country! Russia today again hit Kyiv with missiles. Early in the morning. The second army of the world triumphantly \"defeated\" a kindergarten and an apartment building. The man died, he was only 37 years old. There are wounded, among them - a girl named Zhenya, she is seven years old, the daughter of the deceased, now she is in \"Okhmatdyt\". Her mother was also wounded. By the way, a citizen of Russia. That’s that. She was not threatened by anything in our country, she was completely safe, until Russia itself decided that everything was equally hostile to them now - women, children, kindergartens, apartment buildings, hospitals, railways. Missiles also hit the Mykolaiv region, the Chernihiv region, Odesa, Cherkasy. Artillery and mortar shelling did not stop in the Kharkiv region, in the Sumy region, in Donbas, in the south of our state. My condolences to the families and friends of the victims. Everyone who was injured is given all the necessary help. Part of the missiles were shot down. But only part. We need a powerful air defense - modern, fully effective. Which can ensure complete protection against these missiles. We talk about this every day with our partners. There are already some agreements. And partners need to move faster if they are really partners, not observers. Delays in the transfer of weapons to our state, any restrictions are actually an invitation for Russia to strike again and again. The occupiers - these terrorists - must be beaten with all our might so that they do not think they can put pressure and outplay someone. What are these missiles about today? And what are yesterday's 62 missiles - for only one Saturday, for 24 hours - are about? They are about the Russian method: to escalate every time international events take place. And at the same time they are about determination. About, for example, the fact that the leaders of the G7, who gathered in Germany today for a summit, have enough common potential to stop Russian aggression against Ukraine and against Europe as a whole. It is possible. But this is possible only if we get everything we ask for, and just in time we need it - weapons, financial support, and sanctions against Russia. It cannot be otherwise in this war. Because it is here - in the sky over Kyiv, in the sea near Odesa, on the land of the Kharkiv region, Donbas, in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions - that it is being decided what life will be like in Europe in the future. Here, in Ukraine, and nowhere else. Of course, there are not as many missiles in Russia as we have confidence in ourselves. But Russian weapons can be stopped only by more powerful weapons. I spoke about this today with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau - how else we can strengthen defense support for Ukraine and how else we can increase the pressure of sanctions on Russia. I thanked Justin for the help already provided - one of the most tangible. And today I want to say a few more things, very targeted. Firstly, all pilots, dispatchers, mechanics and other people who ensure the launch of missiles at Ukraine must understand: we will find you all. Each of you will be responsible for these strikes. And if someone thinks that he will evade responsibility by saying that such was the order, you are mistaken. When your missiles hit residential buildings, these are war crimes. Trial is what awaits you all. And there will be nowhere to hide for you - neither on the shores of the Caspian Sea, over which your missiles are launched, nor in Belarus... Nowhere. And I would like to separately address the citizens of Belarus today. Both civilians and those in uniform. You are being drawn into the war. And even more actively than in February and in the spring months. The Kremlin has already decided everything for you - your lives are worth nothing to them. But you are not slaves or cannon fodder. You do not have to die. And you can prevent anyone from deciding for you what awaits you next. I know that the people of Belarus support Ukraine, they support us, definitely us, not the war. And that is why the Russian leadership wants to draw you - all Belarusians - into the war, wants to sow hatred between us. A lot now depends on the ordinary people of Belarus. And I know that you can refuse to participate in this war. Your lives belong only to you, not to someone in the Kremlin. Ukraine will defend itself from strikes from any direction and from any weapon. I'm sure we will endure and get everything back. But anyone, any normal person in any country, in particular in Belarus, can contribute to the protection of life. This week will be very important for all of us. Therefore, we continue to work at all levels and do not slow down. Glory to all who defend the state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "This address is without greetings. Today's Russian strike at a shopping mall in Kremenchuk is one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history. A peaceful city, an ordinary shopping mall with women, children, ordinary civilians inside... Before the air alarm there were about a thousand people. Fortunately, as far as we know at this time, many people managed to get out in time. They were taken out in time. But there were still people inside: staff, some visitors... Only totally insane terrorists, who should have no place on earth, can strike missiles at such an object. And this is not an off-target missile strike, this is a calculated Russian strike - exactly at this shopping mall. It is not yet possible to establish the number of victims for now. A fire broke out in an area of more than 10 thousand square meters. The rescue operation continues, but we must be aware that the losses may be significant. As of now, we know about 12 dead and 24 wounded. We are establishing the number of people under the rubble. All the wounded will be provided with all the necessary assistance - Kyiv doctors have already left for Kremenchuk. The Minister of Internal Affairs is already there, he will coordinate all the necessary actions. My condolences to the families and friends of those killed in this terrible terrorist attack. And I ask each and every one - whenever you hear the air alarm siren, go to the shelter. Necessarily. Don't ignore it. Russia will stop at nothing. This morning, I appealed to the United States to recognize Russia as a state that sponsors terrorism. The relevant resolution is approved by the US Senate Committee, and the legal decision can be adopted by the Department of State. And such a decision is clearly needed, and it must be supported by the entire democratic world. I told this to the participants of the G7 Summit, which took place in Germany. As of today, Russia has used almost 2,800 different cruise missiles against Ukraine. The number of air bombs and MLRS rockets hitting our cities simply cannot be counted. There were hundreds of thousands of them in the four months of the war. This is nothing but terror. Another brutal shelling of Kharkiv, northern Saltivka took place today. At present, we know about 5 people killed and more than 30 wounded, 5 of them children. All are civilians, no military. The Russian state has become the largest terrorist organization in the world. And this is a fact. And this must be a legal fact. And everyone in the world must know that buying or transporting Russian oil, maintaining contacts with Russian banks, paying taxes and customs duties to the Russian state means giving money to terrorists. I also said today, addressing the leaders of the G7, that our common potential is absolutely enough to defeat the Russian army - it does not know how to fight. All the operations we carry out to deoccupy our territories show one thing: the occupiers are crumbling when we have something to put pressure on them. They do not know how to resist. They are capable only of such vile strikes as those in Kremenchuk or Saltivka today, only of the total thoughtless destruction of all living things as in Mariupol. Therefore, the war may not drag on, if we can really push together and drive the occupiers out of our Ukrainian land. The sooner this happens, the more lives will be saved. Even before the start of a full-scale war, we told our partners that we needed modern missile defense. We repeated this after February 24 as well. People in the Kremenchuk shopping mall deserved security just as much as people in any mall in the world - somewhere in Philadelphia or Tel Aviv, or in a shopping gallery somewhere in Dresden. The world can, and therefore must, stop Russian terror. And now I can already say this - I heard it from our partners: Ukraine must get reliable missile defense, we are expecting the supply of appropriate systems. And there is another important result of the \"seven\", which is worth mentioning right now. This has already been officially agreed: the most powerful democracies in the world will support our state as long as necessary for our victory. Ukraine will not be broken! Never. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Unbreakable citizens of an unbreakable country! Great people with a great history! Conscientious society of the state guided by the rule of law! The fact that all of the above is true is proved by many things. Ancient documents and chronicles, historical and legal landmarks, religious traditions and folk customs, science, literature, music, painting, legends and myths, proverbs and sayings, and even news releases. All this in its own way depicts our state and all of us. But there is one thing that, in my opinion, gives the most detailed and objective assessment. This is the Constitution of Ukraine! This is a point of development that we have reached as a state and society over the centuries of history. The government system is our intellect. The form of government shows whether we have moved to the next level of civilization or are stuck in an era of tyranny and dictatorship. The Constitution, like an X-ray, shows our strengths and weaknesses. Our principles, our values, our ideals. The level of freedom and rights that we are willing to defend. The level of maturity and responsibilities we are willing to fulfill. The norms of the Constitution make it possible to decipher the genetic code of our nation. Find the answer to two main questions: what is Ukraine and who are the Ukrainians? This is our detailed portrait. And especially now, during a full-scale war, its main features are clearly visible. We passed the Basic Law of the state 26 years ago. 26 years later, defending our state is the basic law for us. Why? The answer is in the preamble of the Constitution. The principles of its adoption 26 years ago are the principles of our struggle now. They explain why and what we are fighting for. This is the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination, the universally approved independence of Ukraine, the irreversibility of the path to Europe. This is the responsibility to God, to one's own conscience, to previous, present, and future generations. We didn't start the war, we were not the first to shoot and we were not the first to attack. We defend Ukraine, which is a sovereign, independent, democratic, social and legal state. Taking up arms, we did not hesitate, as at a crossroads. We did not choose whether to defend the first article of the Constitution or to adhere to the first commandment of God. God is on our side, he says that defending your home from evil is not a sin. It is a sin not to defend it. Our sovereignty extends to the entire territory. We are a unitary state. Our territory within the existing borders is integral and inviolable. That is why in the east and west, in the south, in the north and in the center, our people are heroically fighting for these principles and for the second article of our Constitution. Repelling the second army of the world. Which is indifferent to all the threats and risks of World War III. But we are not indifferent to the norms of the third article of the Constitution. A person, a person's life and health, honor and dignity, inviolability and security are the highest social values. And our people are defending this principle at the cost of their lives, health and security. With honor and dignity! The norm for us is to protect it. The norm for us is to protect other norms. Land is the main national wealth. Its subsoil, air, water and other natural resources of its territory, continental shelf and sea zone are the property of the Ukrainian people. We will fight for every meter of our land to the last breath. Because only the people can change the constitutional order in Ukraine. No one can usurp state power. We know the term \"democracy\" well, so we don't know what the fifth term is. Our right to protest, assembly and manifestation is a constitutional article, and for others it is a criminal one. State symbols are not symbolic or formal for us. Our state flag is a flag made of blue and yellow stripes. Two sacred colors. The third is not given. As it is not allowed for a foreign tricolor to hoist over our land, in our sky in any way different than with the prefix \"temporarily\". Our coat of arms is a sign of the Princely State of Volodymyr the Great. This is a trident. Not two-headed birds. Because this is not going to fly here. Our National Anthem \"The glory and freedom of Ukraine has not yet perished…\" They live and will live on. Our people in the occupied cities are not afraid to go to peaceful rallies and sing their anthem. Sing out loud. Looking into the eyes of the occupier, sing that they will vanish like the dew in the sun. This nation cannot be defeated! Only exterminated. But even this is impossible. Because we are of Cossack descent! And our state language is Ukrainian. And we respect all other languages. We do not oppress any of them. That is why today people are fighting for Ukraine in Ukrainian, Crimean Tatar, Polish, Russian, Belarusian, Moldovan, Hungarian, Romanian, Georgian and many other languages! Because it is clear without words what evil is. And you can beat it without words. The occupier expected a warm welcome, but faced fierce resistance. Meeting not with bread and salt, but with \"Stugna\" and \"Javelin\", \"Bayraktar\" and \"Neptune\", \"Vilkha\" and \"HIMARS\". Our resistance has lasted for 125 days already. For the world it is the eighth miracle, for the enemy it is the ninth wave, and for us it is the seventeenth article of the Constitution of Ukraine. The defense of Ukraine is the most important function of the state and the matter of the entire Ukrainian people. We have no choice but to defend our choice. It is our obligation to protect our rights. Rights guaranteed by the Constitution. An inalienable right to life that Russia has violated tens of thousands of times and claimed tens of thousands of lives. It is the inviolability of home, which is violated every day and night by its missiles, bombs and bullets. These are rights that are familiar and inalienable to us. This is freedom of speech. That is why Ukrainians are not afraid to tell the enemy \"go home.\" Because they have freedom of thought. They know how to think, see, hear, understand, distinguish truth from lies. This is the right to vote and to be elected. Impossibility to be arrested for nothing. Freedom of movement. Immunity. These are all children's rights. We are fighting for all this today. To defend, liberate and restore. For our future generations to have rights, our generation has no right to give up. We do not have such a desire either. The enemy will not be able to realize the force with which we are ready to fight for our rights and freedoms. He who does not have it himself will never deprive others of it. That is why victory is inevitable for us. Punishment is inevitable for the enemy. And it will come. And peace will come, too. And our children will finally go to school. They know from an early age what freedom and struggle for it are, what rights are, what the Constitution of Ukraine is. And they know what glorious legal ancestors they have. In particular, the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk, which is over 300 years old. It is called the first written Constitution of Europe. And last year it visited home, Ukraine, for the first time. It was exhibited in Kyiv, but it is fair to read it in every corner of Ukraine. To this end, it will be translated from Latin into Ukrainian, and tens of thousands of copies will be sent to Ukrainian schools! We are sure that sooner or later the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk, the Constitution of independent Ukraine, and other subjects of the Ukrainian school will be studied by our happy and smiling children - in Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol, Kherson, Crimea! Victory is not far off! Victory will be ours! Happy Constitution Day of Ukraine, dear citizens! Glory to you! Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! First of all, I would like to thank the Albanian Presidency of the UN Security Council for convening this meeting promptly - at the request of Ukraine - and for the opportunity to address you. Unfortunately, as of now, the United Nations does not have a legal definition of \"terrorist state\" agreed by all UN member states. But the war that Russia is waging against Ukraine demonstrates not only the meaning of this concept, but also the urgent need to enshrine it legally - at the United Nations level - and to punish any terrorist state. Take a look at the events of just a few days in Ukraine - a few of 125 days of Russia's full-scale war against our state. Saturday, June 25, 62 Russian missiles hit our cities. Sunday, June 26, 10 more missiles. In particular, one of them hit a residential complex in the capital of our state, Kyiv. Three floors of an ordinary house were destroyed. Another missile exploded in the yard of an ordinary kindergarten. Monday, June 27, a missile strike at Kremenchuk. The person who carried out this strike knew for sure that he was aiming a missile at an ordinary shopping center, at one of the many shopping malls that exist in any country in the world. As of now, we know about 18 people killed, but this number may unfortunately increase; more than 50 people were wounded, dozens more are on the missing list. 7 fragments of bodies were found: torn off limbs, arms and legs of people torn off by explosion. And if the Russian state claims that these victims are allegedly not from its missile strike, then I now propose to the United Nations to send either a special representative of the UN Secretary General or a plenipotentiary commission to the site of this terrorist attack in Kremenchuk, so that the UN has an independent opportunity to get all the information and see that this is really a Russian missile strike. Yesterday, the Russian army also struck with MLRS at a queue of people standing to get water. It was in the city of Lysychansk, Luhansk region. Ordinary people, civilians. None of them were military. Just a queue to get water. Eight people were killed, including a 15-year-old boy, his name was Danylo. And the oldest among the dead was 68 years old. And I want you to hear now the names of four women killed by this strike: Viktoriya, Iryna, Olena, Liudmyla. Kharkiv suffers brutal Russian strikes almost every day. Just yesterday 9 people were killed, 29 were wounded, 5 children among them. I want you to know their names: Hlib - 12 years old, Oleh - 8 years old, Mykhailo - 11 years old, Hryhoriy - 9 years old, Artem - 10 years old. It was a Russian artillery strike at ordinary residential buildings. Today at 5 am the Russian army also carried out a strike at Mykolaiv and the city of Ochakiv, Mykolaiv region. Three people were killed in Ochakiv. A 6-year-old girl - her name was Yeva. A man named Mohammed, he was 76 years old. And a woman named Halyna, she was 50 years old. Among the wounded there is a baby, a boy, he is only 3 months old, he was born after the beginning of this full-scale Russian invasion, his name is Volodymyr, and his condition is very grave - now he is in intensive care. I emphasize: a baby. A 3-month-old baby. Two more missiles for today - at the city of Slovyansk - it is in Donbas of our state. In the long-suffering Donbas, which Russia has been tormenting since 2014. Just a few hours before my address to you, to the UN Security Council, two missiles hit the Odesa region. The city of Dnipro was also hit, and one of these missiles destroyed a car service station. Not some military station - the usual car service... And I have a question for you, ladies and gentlemen, who among you does not agree that this is terrorism? If in any part of the world any organization killed any civilians just as Russia kills Ukrainians, it would definitely be recognized as terrorism. Such an organization would become an enemy to all mankind. Therefore, what is punished at the level of specific criminals and criminal organizations must not go unpunished at the level of a state that has become a terrorist. Daily terrorist acts. No days off. They work as terrorists every day. The UN Charter confers on the UN Security Council \"the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.\" Article 6 of Chapter II of the UN Charter clearly states that \"A Member of the United Nations who has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.\" Although Russia is violating the fundamental principles of the United Nations and the international legal order, it has not yet been held to account at the global level. It still remains in the UN agencies and even enjoys the privileges of the seat it occupies, the seat of the permanent member of the UN Security Council, which Russia occupies solely due to the short-sightedness of the politicians at the end of the Cold War. Russia has no right to take part in discussing and voting in regard to the war against Ukraine, which is unprovoked and simply colonialist on the part of Russia. I urge you to deprive the delegation of a terrorist state of its powers in the UN General Assembly, and that is possible. That is necessary. That's right! That's fair! Russia has no right to remain in the UN Security Council. And this path is not as thorny, as someone may believe, if you show consistency and proper political will. This is the only logical way for the UN Charter to work and be respected by all members of the Organization. Furthermore, our Organization already has enough power to bring a terrorist state to justice. Chapter VII of the UN Charter allows for the establishment of a special international tribunal to investigate the actions of the Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil. The word \"genocide\" has repeatedly been used. And you all saw what the Russian occupiers did in our city of Bucha. Each of you can obtain information on how many mass graves appeared around the city of Mariupol alone after the Russian army razed it to the ground. It was a city of half a million residents! Now there are ruins. In the case of the genocide in Rwanda, the UN Security Council established an International Tribunal within six months since the beginning of the genocide. More than four months have passed since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. It has been 8 years since the beginning of Russia's war against Ukraine in Donbas and the occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which has been repeatedly condemned at the level of the UN General Assembly. We need to act immediately - and do everything to make Russia stop the killings of children, people - everyone. It must be brought to justice for terrorism, otherwise it could bring terrorist activity to other European countries, Asia - the Baltic states, Poland, Moldova, Kazakhstan - many nations have already heard threats from Russian officials and state propagandists. I am grateful to all the diligent and civilized states who share our position and help defend the international legal order. This meeting of the UN Security Council was convened after the Russian missile strike at Kremenchuk. But in fact, the meeting of the UN Security Council may not be interrupted at all and go on round the clock day after day to have time to discuss every terrorist act of the Russian state. The UN Charter gives all the levers to influence any violator of the rules of the Organization, any aggressor, any terrorist state. And I urge you to use these levers. It is imperative to deprive the Russian delegation of the opportunity to manipulate the UN. It is imperative to make it impossible for Russia to stay in the UN Security Council until its terrorism continues. It is imperative to establish a tribunal to investigate everything that the Russian troops have done against Ukrainians. And it is imperative to give a legal definition of the notion \"state terrorism\" at the UN level. All Russia's actions must receive a legal assessment - global sanctions for destroying the international legal order. Thank you for your attention and I wish to say just one more thing. Various countries of the world may have different attitudes to war, to any war. But in every country of the world, the memory of the deceased is equally honored. Not just the military, but every person, every child who dies in a tragedy of war. That is the usual thing. People treat with respect and compassion those perished and whose lives were unjustly taken away. Only the killers do not honor the memory of those they killed. And I ask you now - I will be grateful to you - to honor the memory of all Ukrainians who have been killed in this war. All the adults, all our children. Tens of thousands of people. I ask you to commemorate them with a moment of silence. Thank you."

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! I have just taken part in a special meeting of the UN Security Council convened at the request of Ukraine. Convened by Albania - this state presides in the Security Council. We have taken advantage of all international levers to bring Russia to justice for state terrorism. For everything done by the Russian army against Ukrainians in Kremenchuk, in Ochakiv, in Lysychansk, in Kharkiv, in Dnipro, in many, many other cities of Ukraine. As of this evening, the total number of Russian missiles that have hit our cities is already 2,811. And there are many more air bombs, many artillery shells... The UN Security Council today stood in silence to commemorate all Ukrainians killed by the Russian army on our land. The members of the Russian delegation looked at everyone present in the Security Council and also decided to stand up - just so as not to look like outright murderers. But everyone knows that it is Russian terror, it is the Russian state that is killing innocent people in this war waged against the Ukrainian people. I called on the UN to use the existing mechanisms of the Charter to stop Russian manipulation of the Organization's structures and to set up a special tribunal to investigate the actions of the Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil. Ukraine's law enforcement and intelligence agencies are doing their best to identify all Russian servicemen responsible for the terror against our cities. The names, faces and all information about each of these terrorists will be known to the world. None of them will be able to avoid responsibility, and personal sanctions will not be enough for these people. A sentence and imprisonment are the minimum they deserve. And I wish to say separately about the responsibility of those Russian propagandists who lie about this terror, who are trying to justify the actions of the Russian army. Each of you will also be punished. We have all the evidence of what the Russian troops are doing against our people. Today, I want to end this address with one such piece of evidence - so that no one dares to deceive about the missile strike at the shopping mall in Kremenchuk. The Russian missile hit this very object, purposefully. Obviously, that was the order. It is obvious that Russian assassins received such coordinates for this missile. They wanted to kill as many people as possible in a peaceful city, in a regular shopping mall. Here is what happened in Kremenchuk: And for this act of state terrorism, as for all others, Russia will be responsible. On the battlefield in Ukraine, by the strengthening of sanctions and, of course, in the tribunal. I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 314 more combatants were awarded state awards. Eternal glory to our defenders! Glory to Ukraine!"

Today is really the beginning of a new history. Not just for NATO's eastern flank, but for the entire Alliance. For the whole Euro-Atlantic community. In a time of extremely aggressive Kremlin, the world needs an extremely bold Alliance. And I am sure that the next summit in a year will show the results of this summit and what the future of NATO will be. I am grateful once again for this opportunity, and my address to you at the next NATO summit, next year - with my direct participation, not this online format - will be a testament to our common victory. But next year could be a worse situation - if not only Ukraine, but also several other states, possibly members of the Alliance, come under fire from Russia. And then it will be our common failure - Ukraine and NATO. You are all well aware of what Russia's goals really are. For many years it has been threatening to start a war. Threatened - if Ukraine joins NATO. But Ukraine is not in NATO, and Russia's full-scale war against our state has been ongoing for 126 days - after 8 years of war in Donbas. So why has everyone believed for decades that it was NATO that could provoke Russia into something by its actions? Russia's goals are known. They are obvious. The Russian leadership sees the world differently. Not like you. They see Lithuania, for example, not as a member of your Alliance, but as a republic of the Soviet Union. For us, it is an independent state and has long been a former republic of the USSR, for us it is the past, and they see it as a possible future, they want to enslave it again. They consider it that way. They see it that way. And the same goes for every country that is Russia's neighbor. For every state that was once under Moscow's influence. Only now - at this summit - will you identify Russia as your main threat, but you have been an enemy for them for a really long time already. And the ideology of Russia is based on this, it is reflected one hundred percent in its propaganda, its task is to break you, to put pressure on you. And it is surprising that the work of propagandists, Russian television in some of your countries continues! This is not about freedom of speech. This is a concrete preparation of war against you, within your states. And please look at our state - what it can lead to in yours! Russia's tactics are very simple. It destroys everything - houses, shopping malls, schools, hospitals. More than 2,800 missiles since February 24, and the vast majority were aimed at civilian targets! What is it for? What are the bombs for? What are total artillery strikes for? The Russian army is doing everything possible to force as many people as possible to leave their cities. So that there is nothing but ruins. And then the so-called \"second army of the world\" enters these cities - already empty and already dead. And it does not want to stop in Donbas or somewhere in the south of Ukraine, it wants to absorb city after city, all of us, and then all in Europe, whom the Russian leadership considers its property, not independent states. This is Russia's real goal. The question is - who is next for it? Moldova? Or the Baltic countries? Or Poland? The answer is - all of them. The some goes, by the way, with the food crisis - with the blockade of Ukrainian ports, with the famine that Russia is provoking. What is the real target? You! The same! Hunger is a tool, a means. And its real goal is to put pressure on you, and it's chaos, it's new waves of migration to Europe. Isn't that the case with energy? Why is Russia pulling the gas noose? Why is it putting pressure on Europe? For you to ask. For you to be humiliated. For you to be completely dependent. So that you can be forced to give up your freedom, your democracy and your values - for the sake of certain interests of the Russian leadership. We need to see the real goals of Russia. And if they were different, now there would be no desire of Finland and Sweden to join the Alliance - to get common security. Ladies and Gentlemen! While democracies were calling on the Russian leadership to have reason and morality, Russia was accumulating power and missiles. You, the democratic leaders, have urged it to respect international law, but tyrants understand force. And force only! And this is clearly seen in those areas of Ukraine where the Russian army has been severely rebuffed. Ukraine commends the decision on the accession of Finland and Sweden to the Alliance. And it is very good that this has happened now - before Russia could start acting against these states as well. But is Russia doing anything against them now given this decision? No, and you see it. The Russian leadership has publicly stated that the Leningrad streets taught them the rules of life. There, any attempts at dialogue and appeasement are perceived only as weakness and fear. There, you don't make a phone call to anyone to talk when you have to hit back. There, you either hit or lose. This is exactly how the Russian state sees the world right now. And this vision cannot be ignored, its true goals cannot be ignored. You need to answer them. And I'm sure you all know how to respond. In fact, our goals - the goals of Ukraine - are exactly the same as yours. We are interested in security and stability on the European continent and in the world. It is in our interest that the lives of nations are determined not by the infamous Munich speech of one leader, but by international law. We are interested in the absence of any \"gray zones\" and territories of total war, where there is nothing left but ruins. You are also interested in this. Helping Ukraine end this war by winning on the battlefield now - that is, giving a really strong answer to what Russia is doing - is what we and each of your states and the whole Alliance, the whole Euro-Atlantic community need. If you really identify Russia as your threat, your main threat, you must fully support its main - the first - target. This is not a war of Russia only against Ukraine, this is a war for the right to dictate conditions in Europe. For what the future world order will be like. That is why it is absolutely necessary to support Ukraine right now with weapons, finances and political sanctions against Russia that will stop its ability to pay for the war. Ukraine needs modern missile and air defense - and you have these systems. By providing them to us, you can completely break Russia's tactics to destroy cities and terrorize the civilian population of Ukraine. This is a fundamental thing. The distance from Kyiv to Madrid is less than the range of the missiles used against us today. Can one state respond to such a threat without the help of partners? You can provide this help. And we are grateful for the help you have already given. Russia relies primarily on artillery on the battlefield. On artillery superiority. Dozens of times more strikes than we currently can respond with. Ukraine has already received modern artillery systems - and I am very grateful to you. But the war continues and it is a war in which artillery is of great importance. The war should not drag on. To prevent this, we need to break the Russian artillery advantage - a significant advantage, we need much more such modern systems, modern artillery. Financial support for Ukraine is no less important than aid with weapons. Russia still receives billions every day - and spends them on the war. We have a multibillion-dollar deficit - we do not have oil and gas, which could cover it. We need about $ 5 billion a month - you know that, and that's a fundamental thing as well. This is exactly what is needed for defense and protection. And we need a new understanding of NATO's eastern flank. It is possible to get rid of the \"gray zone\" and guarantee security only together with Ukraine. Just think about one fact now: today, a non-NATO country, albeit with your support, has been holding back a state that you all officially identify as your main threat for more than four months. We are deterring Russia from destroying us and from destroying you. Ladies and Gentlemen! Russia must be isolated. It should not be in those international structures it wants to destroy. There should be no dialogues that don't make sense until it starts looking for that dialogue itself. It must seek dialogue itself, itself, and therefore seek peace. And, for the sake of peace, the understanding of NATO's eastern flank must be revised. Is it a coincidence that all Allies in the east, all our neighbors, stand for Ukraine's membership in NATO? No, this is not a coincidence. This is logic. This is the understanding of life in our region. NATO's open door policy should not resemble the old Kyiv metro turnstiles: they are open, and when you approach, the turnstiles close until you pay. Hasn’t Ukraine paid enough yet? Is our contribution to the defense of Europe and the whole civilization still insufficient? What else is needed then? I can say what we need: we need security guarantees, and you have to find a place for Ukraine in the common security space. There will be either urgent help for Ukraine, which is enough to win, or Russia's postponed war with you. You are now adopting the strategy of the Alliance - and this is first and foremost a strategy for the security of your societies, your states. Strategy for ten years. 126 days of full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Cruise missiles, torture, children murdered, women raped... We do not have 10 years. Do you have them? Are you really sure about that? Thanks again for the invitation. Thank you very much for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Our defenders! A week ago, our country received the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union, and today another step has been taken on the path to membership. A very practical step. \"Transport visa-free regime\" was signed. This is an agreement that removes barriers for Ukrainian carriers. You no longer have to wait for permits for freight transportation. And this will significantly increase the export of Ukrainian goods by road transport. This is exactly the task of our state now - not to lose a single week in relations with the European Union. Despite this war, despite all the difficulties, we will constantly do what brings us closer to full membership in the European Union. By the way, yesterday I held a special meeting - a big meeting including 28 participants representing the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. The state will have a relevant document - a clear map of actions that can be checked by any citizen of Ukraine: what needs to be done by state institutions so that we fulfill our part of the job on the path to the European Union. This document will be presented on July 1. I took part in the NATO summit this morning. This is a special summit. A summit of transformation. The Alliance is changing its strategy in response to Russia's aggressive anti-European policies and Russia's war against our country. It is obvious that it is impossible to guarantee security in Europe in such conditions without our state. And we will do everything to transform this obvious nature into concrete decisions - for Ukraine, for the Alliance. We need clear security guarantees - we will have them, and today I called on NATO members to find a format of decisions that would allow for Ukraine's full participation in our common European security architecture. I called on NATO countries to speed up the supply of missile defense systems to Ukraine and significantly increase the pressure on the terrorist state. Today's Russian strike alone at the city of Mykolaiv - 10 missiles at once, and all of them were aimed at civilian targets - proves for absolutely everyone in the world that the pressure on Russia is not enough. One of these missiles, a hypersonic anti-ship missile \"Onyx\", destroyed an ordinary five-story building. Dismantling of the debris continued over the day. As of now, five people are known to have been killed. There were also strikes at Ochakiv, Dnipro, the Russian shelling of the Kharkiv region, Sumy region, Donbas. Lysychansk, Avdiivka, communities in the Bakhmut direction - the situation there remains extremely brutal, very difficult. We are doing everything we can to provide our military with modern artillery systems to respond properly to the occupiers. Russia squeezed out the message of Syria about the alleged recognition of the occupation structures in Donbas as alleged states. This is an empty story. And in that case, there will be no more relations between Ukraine and Syria, and the pressure of sanctions against Syria will be even greater. For the first time in all the years of independence, the President of Indonesia, a very influential state that may suffer significantly from the food crisis provoked by Russia, paid a visit to Kyiv today. Therefore, these were important negotiations that opened for Ukraine another strategic direction of relations with Asia. One of the most famous businessmen in the world, Richard Branson, also visited Ukraine. He is more than just an entrepreneur. He is a visionary, a man who works for progress and the best technology for all mankind. His arrival in Ukraine right now - and he visited Hostomel, where he discussed, in particular, the possibility of rebuilding the airport and building our \"Mriya\", the world's largest aircraft - is a very strong signal to everyone in the world that Ukraine will definitely withstand this war. And I am grateful to Mr. Branson for his willingness to join the post-war reconstruction of our country. And another optimistic and very important news: 144 Ukrainian warriors were returned home from Russian captivity. 59 soldiers of the National Guard, 30 - Navy; 28 - army, 17 border guards, 9 territorial defense soldiers, 1 policeman. The oldest of the liberated is 65 years old, the youngest is 19. In particular, 95 Azovstal defenders return home. I am grateful to the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine and to everyone who worked for this result. But let’s talk about this later. We will do everything to bring every Ukrainian man and woman home. Thank you again. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians!  All our defenders! Undoubtedly, the main word today is Zmiinyi. Apparently, there was just as much talk about Zmiinyi only on the day when the Russian ship arrived there. Then the ship left - forever, and now the island is free again. I am grateful to the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, the fighters of \"Alpha\", I am grateful to our gunners, pilots of the army aviation and Air Force, the command of \"Oleksandriya\". Zmiinyi Island is a strategic point, and it significantly changes the situation in the Black Sea. It does not guarantee safety yet, it does not yet guarantee that the enemy will not return. But it already limits the actions of the occupiers significantly. Step by step, we will drive them out of our sea, our land, and our sky. The situation in Donbas remains the toughest, extremely difficult. The fire superiority of the occupiers is still extremely tangible - they have already taken everything from their reserves to hit us: the Luhansk region, the Donetsk region. I am grateful to everyone who defends our positions in such conditions. This is true heroism. The United States announced today a new package of support for Ukraine, primarily concerning defense. I am grateful to President Biden for this assistance. Soon it will get to the frontline to work for Ukraine, for the defense of freedom. Talked about defense support with the Federal President of Germany. Thanked him for the help that had already been provided. Once again I outlined our priorities - the types of weapons we need. President Steinmeier expressed his condolences over the inhumane attack on Kremenchuk and our other cities. Today, another significant step in our rapprochement with the European Union took place - Ukraine launched a significant export of electricity to the territory of the EU, to Romania. And this is only the first stage. We are preparing to increase supply. At the expense of Ukrainian electricity, a significant part of the Russian gas consumed by Europeans can be replaced. That is, it is not just a question of export revenue for us, it is a question of security for the whole of Europe. I would like to remind you that our country joined the common energy system of the EU already after the start of the war. Ukraine is doing things that seemed impossible. France's Presidency of the Council of the EU ends today. The historical period when we received the candidacy. Europe has become stronger over this time. The Presidency of the Czech Republic begins, and I am grateful to our Czech partners for the fact that they have identified the reconstruction of Ukraine as one of the priorities of their Presidency. It is really important to start reconstruction as soon as possible on the territory that has already been liberated. And our priority - and this will be a task for all representatives of the state - everything should be done as soon as possible to prepare the start of membership negotiations. Government officials, deputies, diplomats - everyone must work on this 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. By the way, tomorrow there will be news on this topic. Ukraine’s European integration cannot be stopped. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for our freedom, the freedom of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Federal President, Dear Mr. Federal Chancellor, Dear moderators! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear attendees and all people who watch us in different countries of our wonderful world! Thank you for the invitation to participate in your forum. Gamechanging is really something that can be said about Ukraine, and it is quite logical that such a forum takes place with our participation. And I immediately want to draw your attention to one fact, very important, in my opinion. Over the years, there have been many different discussions about what our lives could become. People argued for a long time about what should be changed and what can be changed. But now, for the first time in many, many years or even decades, the changes speak for themselves. This is the fact. You don't have to look for them anymore. No more discussions, no more arguments. Everyone can just see what needs to be done. Done immediately! Just look at what is happening. Look at how easily one state created a threat, a large-scale threat, a dangerous wave for many, many others. For example, the threat of large-scale famine. Russia blocked the Black Sea - it's no secret, and it is now keeping millions of people hostage, ordinary people in Africa, Asia, Europe. We are all hostages. You are its hostages. Because if this threat of hunger is not removed, if the Black Sea is not unblocked immediately, the food crisis will result in such a migration tsunami that will reach even you, although Austria is pretty far from the sea. Look at how much one state has been able to do to spread dangerous conspiracy theories and aggressive propaganda. What kind of trust in mass media will we be able to talk about over time, if Russia continues to spend billions of dollars annually to spread lies, and these lies remain in the information space even of the European Union? Please take a look at the cyber attacks that Ukraine, Lithuania, and other countries have suffered. Russia supports cybercriminals whose only mission is to destroy security. I'm sure you're all aware of how big corporations disregard people's right to privacy and appropriate a lot of data about each individual. But... What can you oppose it with when the largest state in the world does this and even much worse? And just look at the prices of fuel, gas, etc. What is happening to them? Markets are too dependent on Russian companies, Gazprom and Russian oil suppliers. And therefore, the wallets of Europeans are too dependent on how much one state wants to extract from them. One state cannot break the lives of everyone in Europe or even in the whole world! This game needs to change! How many years have we been talking about the fact that Europe should not depend on Russian energy resources? And this year, it is necessary to do it in time so that the next winter does not become catastrophic. How many years have we been talking about the fact that Russia spends dollars and euros from oil and gas against the West itself, against the entire community of democratic countries? It is a sponsor of divisions and disinformation, anti-European political movements and problems for the entire continent. This flow of money used against the democratic world must stop this year. Otherwise, everyone in the world who hates democracy will understand that the democratic world cannot defend itself. And about the war. You know, war is said to be the continuation of politics by other means. If we talk about the Russian war against Ukraine, then it is really so. This is a continuation of Russia's long-standing anti-European politics, and every Russian occupier on Ukrainian soil is aware of this. But did everyone truly realize this, everyone in Europe, in the European Union? Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukrainian gamechanging is in the fact that we give a chance to do what should have been done a long time ago. Strengthen European unity as much as possible. Eliminate Europe’s dependence on Russian energy resources. Maximize support for free mass media that work according to journalistic standards, so that there is something to protect the truth from propaganda, and therefore from lies, conspiracy theories and anti-scientific theories. Create effective common European tools for protection against cyber threats. And of course it is vitally necessary to reinforce international law with a real punishment for its violation. The eyes of all aggressive political movements and regimes in the world are now focused on what Russia is doing against us, against Ukraine. They are waiting to see whether Russian officials and military commanders will pay for what they are doing on the territory of Ukraine. Whether the world will be able to bring war criminals to real justice. If the answer is positive, it will be a strong foundation for peace on earth in the future. If not, if hundreds of treaties and conventions violated by Russia remain mere pieces of paper, humanity will have to deal with hundreds of other aggressions. Ukraine gives this chance to take the necessary steps. Ukraine gives time in order to take these steps in time. We are obliged to win the war unleashed by Russia for the hopes of all normal people for a peaceful progressive future to be realized. Is it possible without the help of Austria? I don’t think so. I am grateful to your state for the support. Is our joint victory possible without powerful sanctions, which should be strengthened regularly so that the terrorist state does not have time to adapt to them? No. And I ask you to redouble your activity in the preparation of these sanctions, in the preparation of the seventh package of European Union sanctions. Only at this time, only in these months, only this year the necessary steps can be taken. Either the game will change in favor of Europe, or the enemies of democracy and freedom will believe that the game can change in their favor. We have to do it in time! Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, Dear Prime Minister, Dear people's deputies, Ladies and Gentlemen! A new history of Ukraine and the European Union has begun. We are now not next to each other, but together. Not two neighbors between which there are borders and barriers, but one European family that has common values and a common destiny. And it's not just words, it's not declarative, it's not some kind of hope or political calculation, it's a legally fixed status. Ukraine has gained the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. 115 days between the submission of the Ukrainian application for accession and the response of the European Union is a record short period. We were united just as for our defense. We acted in unity just as for the protection of our state, our land. We did not stop for a moment until the European Council adopted a positive decision, just as we will not stop for a moment until we win. We are aware that the European integration of Ukraine is a guarantee to all generations of our people of a free and prosperous life based on the best human values. And that is why it is an honor and a great responsibility for each and every one of us to participate in the realization of the European aspirations of our state. What is 115 days? These are hundreds of negotiations: meetings, phone conversations, hundreds of events, rallies, concerts in support of Ukraine and our candidacy, hundreds of decisions adopted. These are hundreds of updated procedures and thousands of pages of a perfectly filled questionnaire that we received from the European Commission. All this was not easy, but we did it. Congratulations to you! We have created an extremely strong foundation that no one can destroy and on which we can make our European future our present. Ukraine is fighting for its choice of values: to be an independent state in a large family, in a free family, a new state in a European family. Ukrainians have to defend their independence with weapons in hands. The safety of each of our people. To prevent such tragic Ukrainian mornings as today's - with a Russian missile attack on Odesa and the region, with numerous victims. And to make Ukrainian mornings as peaceful as the mornings of every European capital - now, in the XXI century. And I really want all civil servants today to perceive their duty to work for the sake of the European choice as a struggle for our state, a struggle for Ukraine, for ourselves. We have to prepare the state for the start of negotiations on membership as intensively and as responsibly as we prepared the decision on candidacy. Today, the flag of the European Union will appear in this hall. And it should not just be a beautiful gesture. Not just a symbol. This should be a symbol of our task - the task of all of us, of all branches of government. So that there are no pauses in our work. So that every decision necessary for Ukraine's European path is adopted. And so that these are the decisions the positive effect of which will be felt by Ukrainian society, Ukrainian families and Ukrainian citizens. Gaining membership in the European Union is not only geopolitics or the realization of political aspirations. These are specific things, specific advantages that benefit the life of every person, every company, every state institution. Only recently, the transport visa-free regime and aviation visa-free regime have been implemented. We have got the most free access to the European market - without duties and quotas. We have joined the common European energy network and are now able to export electricity to the countries of the European Union. These are revolutionary decisions for our economy and our state. The next steps are the customs visa-free regime, digital visa-free regime - i.e. Ukraine’s accession to the Digital Europe Programme. We have to significantly speed up the work on the industrial visa-free regime. And of course, we have to achieve a decision on the abolition of roaming charges between Ukraine and the countries of the European Union on a permanent basis. The European path is just such decisions. Each of them strengthens our state, each of you. Together, they create new opportunities for the whole of Europe - thanks to the realization of Ukrainian potential. Europe is becoming stronger together with Ukraine! Many decisions will depend precisely on the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, on each of the deputies. On the extent to which you, dear people's deputies, are ready to work for this path. And on the extent to which government officials will work in coordination with you and our diplomacy. The Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union is already 63% implemented, and 37% remain tasks for all of us, for our state. But you still have to elaborate, defend in front of your colleagues and pass dozens of important bills. It won't be easy either. However, there is no alternative. Even if you know that you will not get applause with this or that decision, if the decision is necessary for this difficult, important European path of our country, you must adopt such decisions. Today, we are signing a joint statement, which is a signal of the unity of all branches of government and evidence of our determination to achieve the strategic goal of Ukraine, namely: full membership in the European Union. And signing this statement should mean the same as signing the application for entry - on the fifth day of the war. We have been going towards candidacy for 115 days. And our path to membership must not take years, decades. We have to cover this path quickly. To what extent it is possible is up to us. We have to do our part of the job ideally to enable our friends in the European Union to make another historic decision for us just as quickly,  in the same consolidated manner. Dear Mr. Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada and Dear Mr. Prime Minister, Dear attendees, Today I want to thank every European nation and every leader who stood \"for\" the candidacy for our state. There have probably never been so many negotiations in such a short period of time. But all these negotiations were substantive, all of them were thought out, sometimes they were not easy. And I want to thank everyone present, our Cabinet of Ministers. Thank you. I am thankful to each and every one. It's really hard work, which turned out to be successful in the end. And a great personal contribution to this success was made by great friends of Ukraine, who are and, I am sure, will be our great friends - President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. And today I have the honor to invite the President of the European Commission to deliver a speech in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Ursula, I wish to thank you once again for your leadership in building these powerful and strong historical relations between Ukraine and Europe, which have become our new history, the new common European history of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! In the Odesa region, the dismantling of rubble after the Russian missile attack on Serhiivka is underway. Three missiles hit an ordinary residential building, a nine-story building in which no one hid any weapons, military equipment or ammunition, as Russian propagandists and officials always tell about such strikes. It was a simple house, about 160 people. It was inhabited by ordinary people, civilians. The recreation center was also destroyed by this strike - an absolutely typical object for the seaside area. I emphasize: this is a deliberate, purposeful Russian terror, not some mistakes or an accidental missile strike. Four people from one family were killed... The murdered boy, 12 years old, whose name was Dmytro... As of now, there are 21 people on the list of the dead, and about 40 are wounded. The numbers have been changing all day, unfortunately, the death toll is increasing. Simultaneously with the missiles at Serhiivka, missiles were fired at Zatoka. 12 missiles hit Mykolaiv at once - various objects in the city. It's only one night and morning... My condolences to all relatives, loved ones of all whose lives were taken by such strikes. I am especially grateful to the United States of America and personally to Biden for the new support package for Ukraine announced today, which includes very powerful NASAMS systems. An anti-aircraft missile complex that will significantly strengthen our air defense. We have worked hard for this supply. In total, this package is worth 820 million dollars and, in addition to NASAMS, also includes artillery munition and radars. We are no less actively negotiating about other new weapons from our partners - it is necessary for Donbas, the Kharkiv region, the south of Ukraine. We are doing everything to break the advantage of the occupiers. The Prime Minister of Norway visited Kyiv today. We discussed the further defense support for Ukraine, the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Norway has already given us significant support, but there will be an additional package of 1 billion euros. Thank you so much. We will not forget. A special Group on International Security Guarantees for Ukraine was formed. The Group is headed by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, ex-Secretary General of NATO (he arrived in Kyiv today). Head of my Office Andriy Yermak will also work with him. The Group included influential figures from various democratic countries of the world - Australia, USA, Sweden, Great Britain, Germany, Poland, France, Italy and, of course, Ukraine. The main task of the Group is to develop a format of security guarantees for our country, which will really work and work long-term, so that there are no future aggressions. We are increasing Ukraine's foreign policy ties with Latin America. I held talks with the leaders of Argentina and Chile. Ukraine's interests will be represented everywhere in the world. Despite the war, despite all threats, we do not stop our movement towards the European Union. Today in the Verkhovna Rada, I signed a statement on European integration together with the Chairman and our Prime Minister. We have specified with this document that we are starting to move from candidate status to full membership. I am grateful to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen who expressed clear support for Ukraine in her address to the Verkhovna Rada today. We will not waste time. I believe that Ukraine will be able to gain membership as energetically as we gained candidacy. I am grateful to everyone who helps our country today, I am grateful to everyone who defends our country. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We are actively preparing for the start of a special conference in Lugano, Switzerland. Its first day is on Monday. A large-scale international event dedicated to the reconstruction of our country. Reconstruction in the broad sense of the word. It is necessary not only to restore everything that the occupiers destroyed, but also to create a new basis for our life, for Ukraine - safe, modern, convenient, barrier-free. This requires colossal investments - billions, new technologies, best practices, new institutions and, of course, reforms. And already on Monday, Ukraine will present in Lugano a national view on how to implement all this. In fact, this is the largest economic project of our time in Europe and extraordinary opportunities for every state, for every company that we will invite to work in Ukraine to prove themselves. The territory of 10 regions was affected by hostilities after February 24. During this time, we managed to liberate 1,027 cities and towns, and another 2,610 are still under Russian occupation. And most of them need to be reconstructed, hundreds of them were completely destroyed by the Russian army, they actually have to be rebuilt from scratch. But besides that, dozens of cities in other regions of Ukraine were hit by missiles. Hundreds of enterprises were destroyed. Among them there are also complex, very dangerous industries - chemistry, metallurgy... Of course, we have already begun to restore normal life in liberated communities and territories on our own. But implementing such a large-scale project across the country, providing new safety standards and a new quality of life is possible only by attracting international capabilities. Therefore, the Conference in Lugano can become an important step for the reconstruction of Ukraine. And when we implement this project - and I am sure that it will happen - this event might be considered its beginning. Although a lot still needs to be done for our victory - and it is a difficult path, because the war continues - but already now we must do everything possible so that the aggressor loses not only on the battlefield, but also historically, conceptually... So that everyone in Russia remembers that Ukraine cannot be broken by anything, by anyone, even by a brutal war. Today, the Russian army continued to fire missiles at our cities. As of the evening alone, there have already been six missile strikes, a total of 12 missiles. Mykolaiv, the Donetsk region... The airstrikes continued. Fierce hostilities continue along the entire frontline, in Donbas - the epicenter is, of course, in the cities of the Luhansk region. The enemy’s activity in the Kharkiv region is intensifying. We managed to oust the occupiers from Ivanivka, Kherson region, we continue to put pressure in the south of our country... In many cities in the rear there is a feeling of relaxation now, but the war is not over - it goes on. Unfortunately, its cruelty is increasing in some places, and it cannot be forgotten. Therefore, help the army, help volunteers, help everyone who was left alone at this time. And constantly use all your contacts abroad, all your information opportunities - even just social networks to spread the truth about the war and about the crimes of the occupiers on our land. Tomorrow and during the week there will be important negotiations and meetings for Ukraine - we do not reduce diplomatic activity for a single day. We also expect new decisions from partners regarding defense assistance to our state... The main thing, no matter how difficult it is for us today, we must remember that there will be tomorrow. And tomorrow should bring maximum benefit to Ukraine - everyone should do absolutely everything possible for this. I am thankful to all our defenders! You are doing great! You are strong! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today, two important professional holidays are celebrated in our country: the Day of the Naval Forces of Ukraine and the Day of Anti-Aircraft Missile Troops. I sincerely congratulate all defenders of Ukraine who serve in these troops, I congratulate all veterans of the fleet, all veterans of anti-aircraft missile troops. Thanks to your service and your bravery, thousands of lives of our people have been saved. The Russian occupiers suffered very significant losses both at sea and in the sky. They have not had such losses for many decades. Thanks again for your service! The main task of the state is to do everything for our heroes, our warriors from all branches of the army to have everything necessary for the defense of the state, to have the most modern weapons. It is not easy, it takes a lot of effort, it requires many negotiations, but we will ensure such a supply. Ukraine will reach the level when the fire superiority of the occupiers will be nullified. We are not losing a single day - we convince our partners, establish new connections, use all opportunities - political, diplomatic, information... Today, the Russian army once again brutally shelled Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, Kharkiv with MLRS and \"Smerch\" systems. In Slovyansk alone, six people are on the list of dead, and about twenty are wounded. A girl died, her name was Yeva. She would have turned 10 in August this year... Russia has enough Smerch, Uragan and Grad systems to destroy city after city in Ukraine. They have now accumulated their largest firepower in Donbas. And they can use tens of thousands of artillery shells every day on one section of the front. This is reality. That is why we destroy the potential of the occupiers - day after day, calculatedly, powerfully. And, of course, the HIMARS systems we received and other weapons from partners play an important role in this. The fact that we protect the lives of our soldiers, our people, plays an equally important role. We will rebuild the walls, we will regain the land, but people must be saved above all else. And if the command of our army withdraws people from certain points of the front where the enemy has the greatest fire superiority, in particular this applies to Lysychansk, it means only one thing: we will return thanks to our tactics, thanks to the increase in the supply of modern weapons. Ukraine does not give anything up. And when someone over there in Moscow reports something about the Luhansk region - let them remember their reports and promises before February 24, in the first days of this invasion, in the spring and now. Let them really evaluate what they got over this time and how much they paid for it. Because their current reports will turn into dust just as the previous ones. We are gradually moving forward - in the Kharkiv region, in the Kherson region and at sea: Zmiinyi is a good example of this. There will be a day when we will say the same about Donbas. The Prime Minister of Australia visited Kyiv today. A historical moment. And this is a very important visit. Australia is one of the top countries in terms of its level of support. We have already received significant defense assistance from it. Today, Mr. Prime Minister announced a new support package. I am grateful to him for that. Australia will also increase sanctions against Russia. This is the result of our constant activity, which increases the cost of this war for Russia. The Russian economy found itself in the biggest crisis in the last 50 years. The world severs ties with Russia. The words \"collapse\", \"deficit\" and \"poverty\" will be the description of Russian life as long as this state wants to be a terrorist state.  They lost more than 35 thousand soldiers, and this is a conservative estimate. What is all this for? For the sake of insane propagandists to be able to show a Russian or Soviet flag on the ruins somewhere in their broadcasts... There is simply no other answer. It is clear to everyone in the world – and, I am sure, to all the sane people in Russia itself – that Ukraine will win. It's only a matter of time. It is a matter, unfortunately, of the losses we suffer, primarily of people. It is a matter of modern weapons, which we must get and will definitely get. Tomorrow there will be a conference in Switzerland dedicated to the reconstruction of Ukraine. Today in Kyiv, I met with the President of the International Olympic Committee, and one of his initiatives is the convening of a special conference to raise funds for the restoration of Ukrainian sports infrastructure... These and many other international initiatives simply would not exist if the world doubted our victory. Therefore, we must continue focused work, fight and beat the occupiers until we regain our entire country. Ukraine will be free. I am grateful to everyone who defends the state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear attendees! For more than four months, you’ve seen, heard and read the news with the headlines \"war in Ukraine\". Over time, such an \"abbreviation\" may distort the global picture of events and the essence of things, everyone's perception of what is happening in Ukraine, it can replace the truth. This is a war in Ukraine, which the Russian Federation started, which the Russian Federation continues, and which the Russian Federation does not want to stop. Ukraine is defending its own land, its sovereignty, its territory. Ukraine is fighting for peace. This is a cruel paradox of the XXI century, and for us these are realities. We cannot lay down our weapons, because otherwise we will disappear. As a state, as a nation, simply as people. Russia has chosen the path of war, Ukraine is fighting on the path to peace. Russia is shooting for destruction, Ukraine is shooting for survival. War is a national idea of the Russian Federation. The national idea of Ukraine is peace. And today I want to talk to you exactly about that, exactly about peace, not about war. For you - Japanese youth - war is something from books, movies, computer games. It is normal for you that Japanese soldiers do not die defending their own land, do not kill and do not encroach on foreign lands. Look around. What seems so ordinary and familiar to you is actually a huge blessing. The sky without missiles and bombs, houses and buildings - not destroyed and not damaged, loved ones and simply all your fellow citizens - not injured and alive. All this is a great blessing. And even more. All this is a \"miracle\" for us today. With weapons in our hands, we defend ourselves so that this miracle becomes a reality for us again. So simple and natural for human civilization. A normal state of affairs for a normal society and a normal country. It is not something incredible, fantastic or supernatural. It's just peace. And this is exactly what Ukraine is defending today. This is precisely the reason for the struggle and the goal of victory for us. Peace. For the sake of the future. To this end, we should all find answers to a number of questions. What will our world be like? Will the rule of force or the rule of law dominate it? A world in which freedom, justice, human rights are the highest values? Or a world in which these values don't matter? What will be the future of the UN and other international organizations - will they remain bureaucratized institutions with a closed \"club of the chosen ones\" like the Security Council unable to bring the aggressor to justice? Or will they be reformatted into functional institutions capable of preventing wars, famine, and effectively combating climate change? And finally, what should be the world's response to the threats of dictators with a \"nuclear stick\"? How should we rebuild cities from scratch so that they become new-conceptual in terms of simplicity, environmental friendliness and energy efficiency? Can we use the Japanese experience of railway networks? How to get rid of energy dependence? What can we do for global food security? How to build a safe cyberspace? What new technologies should be put into service for our citizens? How to make people's lives more comfortable? Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear professors, dear students! The main goal of Ukraine is peace. Peace that is ordinary to you. Which was ordinary for us too, but everything changed in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and started hostilities in the east of Ukraine. And on February 24, 2022, when, in addition to the east, the aggression of the Russian Federation spread to the south, north, center and west, when a full-scale war covered all of Ukraine like a tsunami. Peace. What was the norm has become a memory. What is normal and remains the present for you. And what, I believe, will be the future for us all. Appreciate peace! Cherish the main benefit that gives you all other benefits: the opportunity to study, develop, create and live! Cherish peace, defend peace, do not betray peace. You are capable of many things for the establishment and rule of peace. There is only one time when we can all serve peace in the whole world. And this time is now! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President Cassis! Dear Mrs. President von der Leyen! Dear Mr. Prime Minister Fiala! Dear participants of the Conference! Ladies and Gentlemen! First of all, I wish to thank Mr. President of Switzerland, his team and everyone involved in the organization of our Conference. It is this Conference and its decisions that can become the first stride towards the historic victory of the democratic world. Russia's war against Ukraine is not just an attempt to seize our land and destroy our state institutions, break our independence. This is a much broader confrontation - the one in terms of the worldview. The anti-democratic and anti-European system built in Russia is trying to prove that it is supposedly stronger than all of us – Ukraine, Europe and the democratic world. It is trying to prove that Europe is allegedly weak and allegedly unable to defend its values. Such a worldview motive can be traced in all the actions of the Russian state - both in relation to Ukraine and in relation to all of you. And all the crises created by Russia - inflationary, food, energy, migrant, the contours of which are already present - are the worldview, ideological challenge. However, its most brutal manifestation is Russia's aggression against our state, against us, the first ones it wants to return to its control zone in Europe. Look at what Russia is doing, destroying Ukraine. Russia is destroying the space of everything that matters to us and to any free human life. In four months of the full-scale invasion, 2,102 educational facilities in Ukraine were destroyed. These are schools, these are universities, these are kindergartens... When the Russian army uses artillery against a kindergarten or drops bombs on a school, it destroys not just walls and not just buildings. This is the deliberate destruction of the educational space - the space in which children are socialized, in which people learn to be people. All our societies have just recovered from the COVID pandemic, when for a long time only distance education was possible. Just when everything has started to recover, just when children have found themselves in the usual space of communication, the space of friends, education... Russia came and with its strikes is trying to say that we will not have this space - our education - at all. Why is Russia shelling hospitals? How can they give an order for an airstrike on a hospital or a maternity hospital? This is Russia's manifestation that it is allegedly able to destroy the very possibility of civilization for Ukraine - the basic humanity that exists in every normal country. Russia shows that Ukrainians will not be able to even treat, even give birth to children. 799 medical infrastructure facilities have been destroyed from February 24 to the end of June. In what other country, in what other war were so many medical facilities destroyed in such a short period of time? All this is a deliberate tactic of Russia, not just shelling, but a bet precisely on ideological confrontation. The terrorist state hopes that such destruction will prove the alleged inability of the democratic system and the European choice of our nation to give people not even normal life, but life in general. Look at the systematic destruction by the Russian army of the residential neighborhoods of our cities and the constant missile terror. Why do they do it? This is not a purely military tactic... Each person has a space of home - and it is not only a separate apartment or house, it is a part of the city or the countryside where a person communicates, works, meets with friends, loves, raises children, visits parents. That is why the Russian occupiers fire at residential buildings with tanks or carry out artillery shelling of city blocks, that is why they target missiles on houses to destroy this entire space of life - to kill people's feeling of home. More than 12 million Ukrainians were forced to become refugees because of this war. And how many of them will still return home, even if they have a place exactly where they lived before to return to? After such a brutal war and such barbaric Russian attacks, it will be very difficult for many people to find that feeling again - the feeling of a real home. Russia's aggression still continues, and about eighty thousand objects have already been destroyed. These are tens of millions of square meters of space... And when we see such losses, we must see not just broken walls and not just broken bricks, not just burned corridors or rooms, but millions - millions of human destinies that will never be the same they were before. We must see dreams that no longer exist. Love that became impossible. We must see children who could have lived the same lives as each and every one of you, but now their lives are ruined. Russia not only deprived many Ukrainian children of their home or friends, but also made them orphans, killed their brothers and sisters... Russia's intention is to make such ruins and such losses an alleged \"vision\" of democracy and Europe. With this aggression, Russia wants to prove that it supposedly has not just territory under its control, but life as such, and that it can supposedly decide for everyone whether they will have life at all. Therefore, this war is not just ours, not just a local one somewhere in the east of Europe. No. This is Russia's attack on everything that is of value to you and me. Therefore, the reconstruction of Ukraine is not a local project, not a project of one nation, but a joint task of the entire democratic world - of all countries, certainly all countries that can say about themselves - we are civilized. Rebuilding Ukraine means restoring the principles of life, restoring the space of life, restoring what makes people people. Of course, this means construction, large-scale construction. Of course, this means large funding and colossal investments. Of course, this means a completely new level of security throughout our country, which has to continue to live next to Russia. But it also means a new technological level. It also means an opportunity for our countries, our companies, our specialists to show why freedom is more powerful than any tyranny. Back in the spring, we started offering our partners to join the project of rebuilding Ukraine. Even then, it was obvious that this would be the biggest project of our time – economic, technological, social, and most importantly, worldview. And I am grateful to the countries that have positively accepted our proposals to take patronage over regions, cities or industries affected by the war. In particular, I am grateful to Denmark for its willingness to become a chief in the reconstruction of our city of Mykolaiv. I am grateful to Britain for its interest in the reconstruction of the Kyiv region. And in the same way, I invite all countries of the civilized world, ambitious companies and specialists to join our efforts. In addition to everything else, it will allow us to create millions of new connections in the democratic world, in Europe, between our countries. Every city, every community, every industry that will be rebuilt will have a historical record of who helped it. Just imagine - these are not just flags of the partner country at the entrance to the city, but being woven into the new fabric of life in Ukraine, traditions and heritage of all those who worked on reconstruction. And, of course, I am grateful to the European Commission for the initiative to create a special European platform for the reconstruction of Ukraine. However, all initiatives, plans, ambitions should be in a single system, in which not only the needs, but also the feelings of Ukrainians will be in the first place. Therefore, Ukraine offers its national Reconstruction Plan, on the basis of which it will be possible to implement every initiative, every idea, as well as to use the funds that will be directed to reconstruction in a completely rational way and precisely in the interests of Ukraine. And among the key principles, I would note the following - maximum security; maximum technologies; maximum compliance with environmental standards; maximum use of \"green\" technologies; maximum implementation of barrier-free principles; maximum focus on community interests; maximum transparency - in planning, use of funds, selection of projects; as well as maximum rooting of the reconstruction project in the real economic life of Ukraine in order to realize all this and for the results of the reconstruction to work long-term, which means the creation of jobs and new industries in Ukraine, the localization of your business, your business processes in Ukraine. Of course, it is not only about restoring the substance of life, but also about institutional development. Our country has become a candidate for joining the European Union. The movement towards full membership involves reforms. But the reconstruction of Ukraine also requires reforms. We still have to strengthen our institutions, we still have to update living standards. Our goal is for Ukraine to become not only the freest country in Europe and the most convenient for life and business, but also for us to complete the political part of the work the fastest of all those who moved towards the European Union. We can do it - just as we have already done the biggest reform for the countries of the European community. And this, I believe, is the most important reform and we have already implemented it. The reform of the strength of the European Union is actually the reform of the EU. The European Union is truly united - firmly united now thanks to us, thanks to Ukraine. Thanks to this reform of ours, we have actualized each of the basic values ​​of Europe. In the same way, the support of NATO states for our country means that we have united the Alliance as much as possible. The Alliance has not been so united for decades. And the reconstruction of Ukraine will be an equally great reform for all of us, because we will unite the democratic world to the extent that everyone will see: the worldview of free people always wins. The world will see that no one can ever achieve their goals through war. But now I want to make one important local emphasis. We need to act now. We have already liberated a significant territory of Ukraine - more than a thousand settlements. Challenges remain for a significant territory - economic, energy, social. Restoring school education, providing medicine for people, providing housing for displaced people, guaranteeing jobs for Ukrainians, protecting the energy industry - these are all important tasks right now, and especially on the eve of winter. Therefore, Ukraine presents two levels of action: strategic - and this means the recovery of the entire country, as well as tactical. We need this tactical help. This means the need to quickly restore everything that can be restored. Ladies and Gentlemen! As long as the ruins remain, so does the war. As long as the aggressor can hope to destroy the very foundation of life, there will be no lasting peace. That is why the reconstruction of Ukraine will be the greatest possible contribution to maintaining global peace. We can prove that the democratic world is stronger, Europe is more powerful, that our values cannot be destroyed. And we will definitely do it. Thank you very much for your attention! I invite you all to our beautiful country, the best in the world, to Ukraine, to work with us. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a long and very important day of our foreign policy activity. A conference devoted to the recovery of Ukraine started in Lugano, Switzerland. I want to point out right away that when they talk about recovery, they often put the emphasis incorrectly. It is not only about what we should do after our victory or in the following years, but also about what we need to do right now. Ukrainian forces liberated more than a thousand settlements from the occupiers, and new ones are added every week. Now, for example, in the south of our country. All of them suffered large-scale destruction. And this also means the need for colossal funds for the restoration of infrastructure, for the return of medicine and social services, for the restoration of normal economic life. There are tens of thousands of destroyed houses alone in the liberated areas. And we also need to prepare schools and universities for the new academic year in the entire free territory of the country and in new conditions of constant threat, in particular missile strikes... We must already prepare for the winter and do everything so that we pass this winter calmly from the point of view of energy despite the threats Russia creates every day. A significant part of the economy has been destroyed by hostilities and Russian strikes, thousands of enterprises are out of business. And this means a high need for jobs, for ensuring social benefits despite the decrease in tax revenues. That is why the recovery of Ukraine is not only about what needs to be done later, after our victory, but also about what needs to be done at this time. And we have to do it together with our partners, with the entire democratic world. Do now. Today, Prime Minister of Sweden Mrs. Andersson visited Kyiv. The main topics are defense support - we will get a new enhanced package - we are grateful. As well as new sanctions against Russia and new opportunities for Ukraine, in particular in matters of waste processing. In our country, this topic was neglected for a very long time, and it is not just about what to do with garbage. It's about safety, about quality of life. We need a minimum of 25 new and modern technologically advanced waste processing plants. They are able to provide both energy and secondary raw materials, and finally resolve the age-old problem of dumps and waste landfills, the inability of many communities to find solutions for waste. And if some people think this is untimely, I want to say that the reconstruction of our state is not just the restoration of the walls that we had and that were destroyed by shelling. Ukraine must become the freest, most modern and safest country in Europe - in every sense of the word, in particular, in terms of our environment. I'm sure we will do that. Today is July 4 - the main holiday for the United States of America, Independence Day. And I want to congratulate President Biden, the American people, and all our friends in the United States. I want to quote something. \"We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness—That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed,” the United States Declaration of Independence reads. And agree that Ukrainians have repeatedly demonstrated in their history that we have similar principles. It is enough to look at the Ukrainian Maidans or our tenacity in the defense of freedom. Congratulations again on Independence Day. Thanks for the help! Today, I congratulated Ukrainian policemen on National Police Day and presented the awards. Law and order is based on the quality of their work. Of course, a lot still needs to be done for the Ukrainian police to fully meet the requirements of modern times. But don’t forget about the police heroes who fight on the frontline. About those who ensure demining. Who help the victims of shelling. Who conduct the evacuation. Who deliver humanitarian aid. And who provide us all with protection from crime. The situation on the frontline did not undergo significant changes during the day. The enemy continues to terrorize the border areas of the Sumy region, the city of Kharkiv and the region, Donbas. The Armed Forces of Ukraine respond, put pressure and destroy the offensive potential of the occupiers day after day. We need to break them. This is a difficult task, it requires time and superhuman efforts. But we have no alternative - this is about our independence, about our future, about the fate of the entire Ukrainian people. I am grateful to everyone who defends our country! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mrs. Presidents! Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the invitation to participate in this roundtable. Now, if we look at the news about the life of our societies on any day, we will see that they are dominated by two concepts - war and crisis. A full-scale war against our state and a hybrid war against the United Europe. And if we talk about crises, it is primarily a crisis of the cost of living, which is reflected by an extraordinary rise in prices. Energy crisis. Food crisis. Migration. This is what life looks like today. And we have not yet seen the possible wars or crises that Russia is able to prepare for many countries in the coming years. Is it likely that the leadership of Russia is planning a new invasion of the territory of another neighbor? No one can rule it out. Can Russia create another crisis for all of us in Europe? It can. It is enough to look at the Russian missiles that fly over the power units of nuclear plants in Ukraine. Look and understand: we don't even have guaranteed radiation safety now. And how did all this happen? In response, I can also cite two concepts: gray zone and assurances. Europe has experienced a security deficit for decades. Part of Europe - in the east of the continent, as well as in the Balkans - was outside any effective security architecture. You can explain it as you like, but the presence of such gray zones from the point of view of Moscow looked like a temptation. And any gray zone - be it geographical, be it political, be it economic - is considered by the leadership of Russia as a space of its opportunities - anti-democratic, anti-legal, anti-European. In fact, it was the case that the security of a part of Europe was based only on \"assurances\". You can recall various \"assurances\". Those contained in the Budapest memorandum. The ones that sounded from the European leaders who said that business and dialogue with Russia would supposedly keep it from aggression. Or those that sounded from the Russian leadership, which claimed that it has allegedly abandoned its aggressive policy. It all collapsed. And not on February 24 this year, but back in 2014, when Russia occupied the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. And what do we have now? Again - two concepts. More unity and security guarantees. It is only through greater unity in Europe and effective security guarantees that we can respond to those threats that are currently destabilizing the continent. The future of Europe - calm and peaceful - is simply impossible without it. We need such a unity in Europe that will become the largest in history. Of course, a lot has already been done for this. But not everything yet. For example, what is happening on the energy market in Europe and is happening right now should be viewed as a war. With its gas game, Russia is doing everything to keep inflation growing and to make Europe experience the biggest crisis in history this winter. However, at the same time, we see Greek companies providing almost the largest tanker fleet for the transportation of Russian oil. Once again: this is happening precisely when another Russian energy resource is being used as a weapon against Europe and against the family budget of every European. I am sure that this does not meet the interests of Europe, Greece, or Ukraine. This is just one example of the need for even greater unity. So that Russia is forced to seek peaceful solutions - in particular, in the hybrid wars it is waging. And if we mention the Russian banking system, is it already cut off from the global financial market? No. Connections are still maintained. And therefore, there is still hope in Moscow that in the future it will somehow be possible to deceive the democratic world, somehow it will be possible to break the resistance, in particular, of European countries. Because if they made concessions in something, why won't they make concessions in something else? This is the question. I will also give an example of how greater unity gives a very practical and very concrete result for everyone. Thanks to the recent accession of Ukraine to the common European energy system, the countries of the European Union can now receive our electricity. And this makes it possible to replace a part of Russian fossil fuels - a substantial part in the energy balance of European countries. And not at a \"cosmic\" price, but much cheaper than the cost of electricity on the European market. Let's look at the second tool - security guarantees. Would Moscow attack someone who would be definitely protected? We see now that Russia has accepted this situation and this decision - that Sweden and Finland are joining NATO. Moscow says - \"let them join\". Although earlier Russia said that the Alliance must return to the borders of 1997. This proves the fact that collective security guarantees work. Yes, Ukraine is not in NATO. And when we reached out to start a movement towards membership, we got a negative response even to the request for a Membership Action Plan. But this is not a reason for us to stop. We need such a system of security guarantees, such a safe space, which can be effective even in conditions when we are not in the Alliance. The main goal is to have no gray safety zone. We are not in NATO, but we are on this path. And there must be certainty. And certainty now. What to do to prevent aggression? What should be done to immediately stop the aggression that has started? We want to give answers to this - and we are currently working on them with our partners. With those states that, in fact, will be able to become guarantors. If there was such a system now, there would be no war. If Ukraine had received guaranteed support with weapons, sanctions against the aggressor, immediate isolation of the aggressor, confiscation of the assets of the aggressor and all entities related to it, Ukraine would not be a victim of the most terrible war in Europe. The most terrible since World War II. All this horror would not have happened. And we must do everything so that it never happens again. This is the main task. Ladies and Gentlemen! We are doing everything so that there will be no more gray zones in which Ukraine could find itself. We have become a candidate for joining the European Union and will do everything for integration in all possible directions. We are grateful to all European countries that have supported us on this path. We are grateful to Greece. We will create a system of security guarantees that will protect Ukraine while we are not in NATO. What is our principle? Russia considers the territory of our state as a bridgehead for seizing other European countries, and therefore providing security to Ukraine means providing long-term security to the whole of Europe. But this applies not only to our state. Now Europe is united as never before in many decades. Even 5 years ago, it was impossible to imagine that Europe would achieve such unity, and many discussions on platforms like yours were about how far the division of Europe would go. Division, not unity. Ukraine, I believe, corrected it. And we have to work on even greater unity. Europe is a subject. It is a global subject. It should be so. And this can only happen with Ukraine. Europe must become completely independent, particularly from Russia. From its ability to put pressure on you all or on each of you separately. Is it possible? I'm sure - yes, it's possible. And when it becomes real, you will be able to say that what Europe is going through now will never happen again. The crisis of the cost of living or the threat of the migrant crisis, which will be a consequence of the food crisis, are all the consequences of those dependencies on Russia that still remained in Europe and the democratic world in general. You can look at it in different ways. You can mention various factors that influenced this. But if there wasn’t the one who makes all this worse, there would be no such acuteness of these crises, which makes them catastrophic. We can overcome all this. With unity. By strengthening collective security. With unconditional principles, without which nothing is possible - neither unity, nor security. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! On the night of July 5, an air alert was announced over almost the entire territory of our country. Before that, there has been no air alert in the capital and in some regions for some time, and some people even felt particularly anxious because of such unusual silence. They were overthinking, dreading, looking for some kind of explanation - as if the occupiers were preparing for something... Actually, you shouldn't overthink. You should not look for logic in the actions of terrorists. The Russian army does not take any breaks. It has one task - to take people's lives, to intimidate people - so that even a few days without an air alarm already feel like part of the terror. And this evening, Kyiv and again almost the whole of Ukraine heard the air alarm. As of now, there are reports of strikes at the Khmelnytskyi region - victims, wounded are now being specified. Our task is to hold on, to take care of ourselves, including our emotions, to help the country's defense as much as possible, to protect the state, as much as it will be necessary for our victory. The occupiers again hit the Sumy region, Mykolaiv and the region, the Dnipropetrovsk region. Some of the missiles were shot down by our air defense forces. And we have not reduced and will not reduce our diplomatic activity for a single day to obtain modern anti-missile systems for Ukraine in sufficient quantity. This is a maximum task for our state – to provide basic security for Ukrainians, basic protection against missile attacks already this year. But the fulfillment of this task depends not only on us, but also on the understanding of our fundamental needs by our partners. I spoke today with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. I thanked him for increasing security assistance to our nation by £100 million more, on top of the £1 billion defense support package announced recently. This is a very tangible aid for us. We also discussed with Boris the system of security guarantees for Ukraine, which we are developing, which should work in the long term for our people. Together with the Presidents of Moldova and Greece I took part in the format of a special conference of The Economist. This is already the 26th such annual event, and this year Ukraine and security were, of course, the main words at it. Why do we need it? Our state needs certainty with a safe space right now. We are working very actively to ensure that all our partners both in Europe and on other continents understand our vision of security guarantees. Today, the results of two months of work of the United24 state charitable platform were summed up. Over this time, thanks to the participation of people from dozens of countries, we managed to collect more than two billion hryvnias for the needs of Ukraine. This is not only help to our defenders, but also contributions to demining and humanitarian needs. I personally thanked Liev Schreiber, a very famous actor, for joining United24 as an ambassador. He is a co-founder of the BlueCheck charitable organization, which financed programs for psychological support and evacuation of more than twenty thousand orphans from boarding schools and orphanages in the Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Chernihiv, Odesa regions. Liev's organization also helps families of IDPs in Lviv. Now he, together with Andriy Shevchenko and Elina Svitolina, will work in the humanitarian direction. And one more thing is very important. Today there were a lot of disputes in society regarding the decision of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to approve the Procedure for obtaining certain permits for those liable for military service, conscripts and reservists. I see that there are different assessments of such a decision, there is misunderstanding and even indignation in society. I instructed the Minister of Defense, the Chief of the General Staff, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to report all the details to me during tomorrow's regular meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief as one of the items on the agenda. I promise the people to figure it out. And I ask the General Staff not to make such decisions without me in the future. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today in Kharkiv, the Pedagogical University was destroyed by a Russian missile strike - the main building, lecture halls, university museum, scientific library. This characterizes the Russian invasion with 100% accuracy. When it comes to the definition of barbarism, this strike fits the bill the most. Only an enemy of civilization and humanity can do such things - strike missiles at a university, a pedagogical university. Already the second object dedicated to Hryhoriy Skovoroda was damaged by this strike - a monument that was on the square in front of the university. It was covered with debris, but still the monument is not broken. And the Skovoroda museum located in the Kharkiv region burned down after Russian shelling back in May. However, paraphrasing the most famous words of Skovoroda, no matter how hard the occupiers try to catch us, they will fail. We will definitely endure. And we will restore everything. Finally it is felt that the Western artillery - the weapons we received from our partners - started working very powerfully. Its accuracy is exactly as needed. Our defenders inflict very noticeable strikes on depots and other spots that are important for the logistics of the occupiers. And this significantly reduces the offensive potential of the Russian army. The losses of the occupiers will only increase every week, as will the difficulty of supplying them. Today, the general public became aware that in the south of our country, in the occupied areas, access to social networks, messengers and YouTube was closed. Russian forces have blocked any possibility for people to know the truth about what is happening and about our potential, which we are gradually increasing. Ukrainian forces are currently advancing in several tactical directions, in particular in the south - in the Kherson region, in the Zaporizhzhia region. We will not give up our land - the entire sovereign territory of Ukraine will be Ukrainian. People should know it. Therefore, if you have an opportunity to speak with people in the south of our country - with Kherson, Henichesk, Berdyansk, Melitopol and other cities and villages - please spread the truth there. Use every opportunity to tell the people in the occupied areas that we remember them and we are fighting for them. We are fighting for our entire south, for the entire Ukrainian Donbas - the most brutal confrontation is currently there, near Slovyansk and Bakhmut. We are fighting for the Kharkiv region. The occupiers should not think that their time on this land is long-lasting and that the superiority of their artillery is eternal. I held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Staff. As always, I listened to the reports both from the military and from intelligence. We jointly determined the directions of action for the near future. We are expanding our country's foreign policy vectors. For the first time in the history of Ukrainian-Paraguayan relations, I had a conversation with the President of Paraguay - we appreciate the support from this country, and we will continue to strengthen ties in Latin America. I also spoke with the President of Mozambique today - I congratulated his country on the election to the UN Security Council, and I believe that Africa should get more representation on international platforms and in solving global issues. It is the African countries that are now most threatened by the food crisis provoked by Russia, and we must do everything to force the terrorist state to unblock Ukrainian agricultural exports. A visit to Kyiv by the Prime Minister of Ireland took place, a country that helps us significantly. Ireland even helped us convince representatives of skeptical states in the European Union that Ukraine deserves candidacy and future membership in the EU. We also remember that the Senate of Ireland recognized the crimes of the Russian occupiers as genocide of the Ukrainian people. This step, as well as Ireland's support for legal efforts to punish Russian war criminals, is very important. The help of partners together with the work of Ukrainian law enforcement officers are the very bricks from which the restoration of justice for Ukraine will be built. Every Russian murderer, torturer and rapist who came to our land will be held accountable. And it doesn't matter how long it takes to complete this task. There will be no peace for any of the occupiers. I am grateful to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, the main topic in our country has become the British topic - Boris Johnson's decision to resign as party leader and Prime Minister. In the afternoon I spoke with him and thanked for the support we have received since the first day of Russian terror. First of all, these are weapons: Stinger air defense systems, cool NLAW anti-tank systems, artillery, ammunition, armored vehicles and many, many other things. Substantial political support, strong sanctions against Russia, financial assistance to our state - more than two billion pounds have been allocated for security and defense needs alone since February 24. Britain's role in protecting freedom is truly global. And although this is a reflection of the position of British society, the leadership and charisma of the state leader are always of special importance. Especially at such a time - the time of Russia's full-scale anti-European war, which started its attack on Europe precisely from our state. So it is not surprising that Ukrainians feel personal gratitude to Boris. But let's not forget that we are building relations between states. Great Britain's support for Ukraine should not change, no matter what happens in London's power circles, both Boris and all our friends in the United Kingdom assured me of this. I met today in Kyiv with representatives of the US Congress - Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal. They represent both parties, Republican and Democratic, and both support Ukraine very fundamentally. They were the authors of the resolution calling on the Department of State to recognize Russia as a state - sponsor of terrorism. I thanked them for this activity and hope that it will be brought to fruition. I informed the senators about the situation on the frontline, about what the occupiers are preparing for. In particular, we talked about Donbas, the south of our country, the Kharkiv region. Today, the Russian army hit Kramatorsk again - again with missiles. The occupiers also hit Kharkiv, the cities of Donbas... In each direction, our partners have accurate information about our defense needs. This concerns air defense, modern MLRS. The greater the defense aid to Ukraine is now, the sooner the war will end with our victory and the smaller will be the losses of all countries of the world, the losses of the United States from Russian pressure on democratic societies. Tomorrow I will continue the series of appeals to the European parliaments - it is Slovenia's turn. Tomorrow there will also be a lot of internal Ukrainian news - a very meaningful day is ahead. After the conference in Lugano, which was dedicated to the recovery of Ukraine, government officials have already agreed on emergency aid to our country in the amount of more than $2 billion - these funds will be directed to strengthening the budget and preparing for winter. By the way, export of Ukrainian electricity to EU countries, which has already started, is a significant support both now and during the heating season. The price of electricity on the European market is higher than in Ukraine, and this will enable energy companies to use the earned funds to provide services for Ukrainian consumers. Moreover, with unchanged tariffs. Also, government officials are actively working on the logistics of agricultural exports. I heard the reports from the Minister of Infrastructure and the Minister of Agrarian Policy on this topic today. We will do everything to maintain access to the world market despite the Russian blockade of our ports. And, of course, today I want to express gratitude for the final stage of the struggle for Zmiinyi - our national flag was hoisted there. This operation lasted two months. Intelligence, Special Operations Forces, \"Alpha\" unit of the Security Service, border guards, gunners, Navy, Air Force. And now let every Russian captain - whether of a ship or an aircraft - see the Ukrainian flag on Zmiinyi and know that our state cannot be broken. I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mrs. President, Dear Mr. President, Dear Mr. Prime Minister, Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, People of Slovenia! It is an honor for me to address you in such a special format. And, by the way, now I am near the frontline, so my words in this address are strengthened by the emotions and hopes that our defenders shared with me. I am grateful to all the countries of the European Union in which such appeals of mine took place. We know that Russia tried to disrupt them, tried to use its various connections - political, diplomatic, even business. In Moscow they understand that they have nothing to oppose such trust between the people of Ukraine and Europe and such communication activity with. Therefore, they threatened Europeans, manipulated those who depend on them. But this is already the twenty-fourth parliament of the twenty-seven countries of the European Union, and I want to congratulate you on this obvious evidence that Russia has lost its influence in the European Union. The fact remains the following: most of the countries of the European Union cannot be ruled by Russia. And this is a new political reality in Europe, which we achieved together - every country that stood up for the defense of our common freedom. Everything we said about ourselves became our actions to protect ourselves and our democratic way of life. We don't just enjoy freedom, we have made its defense a key goal of our anti-war coalition. We have not just achieved a new unity on the European continent, but are taking new and strong security, political and economic steps on its basis. And legal steps are next, namely: bringing Russian war criminals to justice. Most importantly, by going through this terrible challenge of the Russian war together, we prove that European values do not remain just a reference to old treaties and conventions, do not serve as formal criteria only at the level of rhetoric, but are the real basis of life on the continent here and now. And every country of the united Europe made its contribution to this. Not only those who occupy a large area on the map and who are used to attending the summits of the \"great\". A free Europe is the result of the principles of all, and in particular those who do not have significant military or economic resources to resist Russian pressure, but who can fight thanks to their honesty and brave heart. Today I want to thank you, friends. I want to thank the entire Slovenian people, for your honesty and for your brave heart. A little more than two weeks ago, the European Council endorsed the decision to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. And this is one of those powerful political steps based on our new unity that strengthens us all on the continent. I am very grateful to you, Slovenia, for supporting us, supporting our candidacy. No one can say now how long our path from application to full membership will take, but we all know that the dream of a peaceful, free and stable Europe will not be realized without Ukraine as part of the European Union. And these are not just words, but another fact that will forever remain a fact. That is why Russia started a large-scale offensive on Europe from Ukraine, because Moscow is fully aware of the importance of Ukraine for the European project. And that is why Russia will inevitably lose, because Europe will not be split up, divided into pieces - as it was before. The eastern border of Europe is now equal to the eastern border of Ukraine, and one day, I believe soon, our eastern border will be marked: the territory of the European Union. In Moscow, they say that they are not enemies of Europe. The Russian leadership uses various propaganda theses to justify itself. But let's look at their actions. Who are they hitting? Russia hit the Europeans with the gas crisis - and for the second year in a row, it is deliberately making efforts to ensure that European gas storage facilities remain unfilled before winter. Russia has driven gas prices in Europe to an all-time high – deliberately limiting supply in defiance of market rules. What did it lead to? Catastrophic inflation. If there were no such prices for energy resources, there would be no such painful consequences for the majority of people in Europe. Russia is also preparing another strike - migration. When the Russian fleet blocked our ports, it was a deliberate decision not just against Ukraine, but against everyone in the world who depends on food imports. And you can already see the consequences. But this is only the beginning, because without our food it will not be possible to stabilize the world market, save the countries of Africa and Asia from hunger. If there is a famine there, it means you will see new migrants on the territory of the EU. Millions of new migrants. I gave only a few examples from the wide palette of Russia's anti-European actions. If the Russian leadership really sought to weaken someone other than Europe, as they claim, then Moscow would not hit the wallets of the residents of even those European countries that tried to be friendly to Russia to the last, and would not try to break the internal social stability of European countries. But thanks to cooperation with Ukraine, the European Union can protect itself, in particular, from such challenges. I will give you a few more examples. Our country joined the unified European energy system. We have a significant surplus in the production of electricity even now, when Russian marauders are dismantling and taking away solar power plants from the occupied regions of Ukraine, and have significantly limited our coal generation by their actions. We started exporting electricity to Romania and Slovakia - at a price that is significantly lower than the prices in the EU. We can quickly increase exports by ten or more times - and this will allow Ukrainian electricity to replace a significant part of European imports of Russian gas. Thanks to our electricity, all European neighbors of Ukraine can get a new energy stability, and therefore a decrease in energy prices in Europe. Let's not forget about the Ukrainian gas storage facilities - the most convenient for our region, large in volume, and therefore able to strengthen the European gas market and make the European Union more prepared for winter seasons. It is the same with agricultural production. Even this year, during a full-scale war, the Ukrainian harvest of grain and oil crops will reach tens of millions of tons. For example, without Ukrainian corn, meat production in Europe and the world suffers - and therefore prices rise. Without our wheat and sunflower oil, there will be shortages in many countries - and therefore prices will rise. I emphasize once again: Russia deliberately blocked our exports in order to worsen the price crisis, to make it catastrophic, including for Europeans. But together with our partners in the European Union - at the level of Brussels and neighboring countries - we are creating new export routes. And the more such green corridors for Ukrainian food through the territory of the EU are created, the sooner we will guarantee protection for the south of Europe from new waves of migration, and therefore guarantee the preservation of internal social stability in the EU countries. Colossal opportunities also open up from the integration of our country into the digital market of the European Union - the business world is well aware of the potential of Ukrainian IT specialists. Industrial cooperation with us, as well as the joint implementation of the project of the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, can give the whole of Europe such an economic boost that will have historical weight and will be remembered in the same way as the implementation of the Marshall Plan after World War II. And I invite your country, as well as Slovenian companies and specialists, to join the reconstruction of Ukraine. The volume of work is already about a trillion dollars. And, of course, security. Can anyone now imagine Europe reliably protected from aggression without Ukrainian heroes? Russian tyranny wants to regain control over all the countries it could once reach. And in order for all the capitals from Ljubljana to Helsinki to feel safe, Ukraine must withstand, preserve one hundred percent of its sovereignty, recover from this war and become a long-term guarantor of Europe's security against Russian revanchism. In order to get to you, they have to get through us, and therefore everyone in Europe is interested in Ukraine winning and being a part of common security formats with the Europeans. We are not going to delay. Ukraine realized its strength. You realized our strength. And this is our historical responsibility - of all leaders working in Europe today - to ensure maximum integration of Ukraine into the European Union. We must become a full member of the EU thanks to the fact that we share common values and for the full realization of the potential of our cooperation in many fields. Your writer, Rudi Kerševan, has some very apt words that perfectly describe the current situation: \"We enrich our lives not with things that have a price, but with things that have value.\" Starting from February 24, Europe focused precisely on what has value, and in a few months this gave progress that had not been seen in decades. Europe is united as never before. Europe has greater agency than ever. Europe has a future that will provide stability like never before. But all this is possible only together with Ukraine. And I believe that when the time comes for the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union, we will ensure that our relations reach another fundamental level - the level of a positive result in the negotiations regarding Ukraine's membership in the EU. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I wish good health to you, dear Ukrainians! Today, I worked all day in the field – in the city of Dnipro and in the region, in Kryvy Rih. I was on the front lines of our defense in Dnipropetrovsk region. I listened to the reports of the commanders, thanked our boys and girls, who are defending the region, on behalf of all Ukrainians. I awarded the Golden Star to the Hero of Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Oleh Hrudzevych – commander of the tank battalion. Thanks to his personal bravery, his unit got out of the encirclement without casualties and destroyed the Russian sabotage group in a battle. A very strong person, you can feel it. I visited the famous Mechnikov Hospital in Dnipro to personally thank our special heroes – all the doctors and nurses who have been rescuing our wounded soldiers and civilians every day since February 24 and since 2014. They are extremely successful on their front lines and gave second birthdays, saved the lives of thousands of our people. I presented state awards to our defenders who are recovering from injuries. I am really very grateful for all the kind words I heard today in Dnipro, that I heard on the front line. Thank you, first of all. Today, I addressed the Parliament of Slovenia. Every day and under any circumstances, we work as much as possible on the foreign policy front. And, by the way, this was already the twenty-fourth address to the parliaments of the EU countries and the first that was made near the front line. I hope that the three other EU countries will also feel that these appeals are not about politics, but about the protection of our common freedom, by the way, and therefore, we will come to the point that one day I will be able to say: all 27 parliaments of the European Union hear the struggle for freedom better than any Russian manipulations.I also held all the necessary meetings with the leaders of Dnipropetrovsk region in general and Kryvy Rih district in particular – both military and civilian. It was about security, economy, social issues. Officials must do not just everything possible, but much more than even possible, to guarantee people a normal standard of living even in such wartime conditions. I am returning to the capital of Ukraine. Of course, I want to say two more things. I congratulated Chief Commissar Zaluzhny on his birthday today. I wished him good health, I wished him and all of us the most important thing – victory. Thank you for your service! And tomorrow, on July 9, and in fact already after sunset today, the Muslim community begins to celebrate Kurban Bayram. This is a special holiday that teaches sacrifice and guides people to do good deeds. I want to congratulate now all Muslims of Ukraine and the world and wish that the rule of peace is restored, and all kinds of evil always lose the sooner the better. The Crimean Tatar people especially expect this, and I believe that the year will come when we will welcome each other in a free Crimea. Kurban Bayramınız Hayırlı ve mübarek olsun! Congratulations on the blessed holiday - Kurban Bayram! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you all health! A brief report on the events of the day – it's already the 136th day of our defense. Today, I held a meeting with President of the French Senate Gerard Larcher and a delegation of senators after Mr. Larcher delivered his speech in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. And I am grateful to him for his inspired and neat address. The address, in which he reminded, in particular, that the front line holds as long as the rear holds, and our rear is now not only the free part of Ukraine, but also all 27 countries of the European Union, the entire democratic world. Therefore, our entire team, the Ukrainian team, works 24\/7 to keep the interests of our state and our defense in the focus of every country that is already or may become part of our anti-war coalition. Mr. Larcher also said another important thing: with every attack on Ukraine, with every crime of the Russian occupiers, with every new martyr city, the resoluteness of Europeans to help Ukraine becomes more stable. It really is. However, the terrorist state does not understand this at all and will never accept it as a fact. Only in one day, the Russian army attacked the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv, Kryvy Rih, the communities of Zaporizhzhia region... It fired precisely at the residential sector – absolutely deliberately, purposefully, at ordinary houses and civilian objects. There are casualties – dead, wounded. The brutal strikes of the Russian artillery in Donbas do not stop for a single day – the Sloviansk direction, Bakhmut, Avdiyivka... You can really stop such terrorist actions only with modern, high-precision and potent weapons. And I want to thank the United States of America for the decision to provide Ukraine with a new defense aid package in the amount of $400 million. Additional HIMARS launchers units and other high-precision weapons allow us to take precisely anti-terrorist steps and reduce Russian attack capabilities. I held a meeting today with representatives of construction companies – with those on whom the quality of Ukrainian infrastructure – our supply routes – depends. The question of building a high-quality transport network is always also a question of safety. And in the conditions of the full-scale war, strong infrastructure is one of the key elements of defense. I thanked the representatives of the construction companies for their work, discussed with them the key tasks for the near future – it concerns both the reconstruction of our country and the additional strengthening of our logistics. Today, I signed decrees on the dismissal of some ambassadors of Ukraine. This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice. New representatives of Ukraine will be appointed to the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Norway and India. Candidates are being prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I am already preparing for the new week – there will be important news, including from government officials. Thank you to everyone who defends the state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! I have been receiving reports all day long today from the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. A rescue operation is underway there after a Russian strike at residential buildings. Two high-rise buildings were destroyed. Dozens of people are under the rubble. Six were saved. There are 15 names in the list of the dead and, unfortunately, this is not the final number. It was a missile strike. And everyone who gives orders for such strikes, everyone who carries them out targeting our ordinary cities, residential areas, kills absolutely deliberately. After such strikes, the killers will not be able to say they did not know something or did not understand something... All those who carried out this shelling, other missile strikes, all those who hit our cities with rocket artillery, as is the case with the Kharkiv region, Zaporizhzhia, Kryvyi Rih, Siversk and Vuhledar in the Donetsk region - they will all be found. You know, Nazi murderers are found and brought to justice even when they are 90 or 100 years old. They are caught all over the world. Of course, we don't want to wait that long. But I give this example to show that punishment is inevitable for every Russian murderer. Absolutely everyone. Just as for the Nazis. And they should not expect that their state will protect them. Russia will be the first to abandon them when political circumstances change. Since the beginning of this invasion, Ukrainian law enforcement officers have been doing everything necessary to record the crimes of the occupiers and to collect evidence. Our partners from many countries are involved in this work. Russian terror has long crossed the line beyond which it became obvious to many in the civilized world that it is a matter of global security to punish Russia, a terrorist state, for everything it has done against Ukraine and the international legal order. My schedule for the coming weeks includes precisely such negotiations and appeals that will contribute to the restoration of justice, to the punishment of Russian war criminals. Moreover, this activity is aimed not only at Europe and other traditional regions for the work of Ukrainian diplomacy. We will do everything so that Latin America, Asia and Africa hear the truth about Russian terror on our land as well. In the past week, many talked about the alleged \"operational pause\" in the actions of the occupiers in Donbas and other parts of Ukraine. 34 airstrikes by Russian aircraft over the past day is an answer to all those who came up with this \"pause\". The Ukrainian army is holding on firmly, repelling attacks in various directions. But, of course, a lot still needs to be done so that Russian losses really cause such pause. Moreover, the pause not before new offensives of the occupiers, but before their retreat from our Ukrainian land. And I am grateful to all our fighters who are bringing this time closer. It is inevitable, as is the punishment for the occupiers. But we have to hold on, we have to fight together on all fronts now - on the political, information and economic fronts, without showing weakness anywhere. We can withstand this war only together - absolutely everyone, every Ukrainian man, every Ukrainian woman. Glory to all who protect our native state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today was a difficult day. First, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to summon Canada's representative to our country due to an absolutely unacceptable exception to the sanctions regime against Russia. It's not just about some Nord Stream turbine that Canada shouldn't have, but still decided to hand over. Hand over actually to Russia. This is about common rules. If a terrorist state can squeeze out such an exception to sanctions, what exceptions will it want tomorrow or the day after tomorrow? This question is very dangerous. Moreover, it is dangerous not only for Ukraine, but also for all countries of the democratic world. The decision on the exception to sanctions will be perceived in Moscow exclusively as a manifestation of weakness. This is their logic. And now, there can be no doubt that Russia will try not just to limit as much as possible, but to completely shut down the supply of gas to Europe at the most acute moment. This is what we need to prepare for now, this is what is being provoked now. Because every concession in such conditions is perceived by the Russian leadership as an incentive for further, stronger pressure. Of course, this decision on one turbine, which leads to many other problems, can still be revised. Russia has never played by the rules in the energy sector and it will not play now unless it sees strength. Debris clearance continues all day in the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. The day before yesterday, Russian terrorists hit two high-rise buildings, and as of now 31 people are known to be killed. Nine were saved. Kharkiv faced new brutal attacks by the Russian army. Another rocket hit a residential building - one block was completely destroyed. In the morning, the occupiers shelled the Saltivka and Kyiv districts with rocket artillery – five people were killed. The Odesa region was hit by missiles, extremely violent hostilities continued in the Donetsk region and on the territory of the Luhansk region. My condolences to all relatives and friends of the deceased… And against such a background, it's just a shame to see people lacking the courage to honestly deal with one turbine. Today I submitted to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a very important draft law - on legal and social guarantees for Polish citizens residing in Ukraine. In fact, this is a response to the law that was adopted by the Polish state in the spring in the interests of our citizens. In particular, I propose to give our Polish brothers the opportunity to legally stay in Ukraine for 18 months, the right to employment, economic activity, study at our universities, medical care. I ask the people's deputies of Ukraine to consider this draft law as conscientiously as possible. In relations with Poland, we have reached the highest level of trust and cooperation not just in decades, but in the lifetime of many generations of our nations. And we must increase it, we must further strengthen our ties in all spheres and on the basis of a clear understanding that Ukraine and Poland can be free only together - in brotherhood. Today, I also signed a decree conferring the honorary title of the Rescuer City upon the city of Przemyśl. For the extremely significant contribution of the city authorities, volunteers and residents to help our people and our defense. Let me remind you that this is the second such decision – the Polish city of Rzeszów was the first to receive this title. I held important negotiations with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte in Kyiv. We discussed our defense cooperation, financial assistance for Ukraine and the further progress of our country on the European path. I am thankful for the strong support, which is currently the largest in the entire history of Ukrainian-Dutch relations. I had a conversation with President of Turkey Erdoğan. The key issue is the restoration of our export routes through the Black Sea. We are working on making it possible. The sooner this happens, the fewer people in the world will feel the impact of the food crisis that was so carefully prepared by Russia. In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our heroes. 287 combatants received state awards. I am grateful to everyone who defends the people and the state! I am grateful to everyone who works for the victory! I believe that thanks to you, the sun will rise in Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I would like to highlight one decision that looks like a technical one, but there is a lot of symbolism and meaningful political work behind it. Ukraine became an associate member of NATO's special multilateral program on technological interoperability. To put it more simply, it is about Alliance’s standards. Now Ukraine not only implements NATO standards, but also can participate in the development of new standards. The experience of our military, the capabilities of Ukrainian institutions, the IT potential of our country - all this will now be the Ukrainian contribution to the development of collective security in Europe. And when does it happen? On the 139th day of a full-scale war, with which Russia planned to destroy us in a week. And the Ukrainian state not only survived, not only defends itself, but also develops and will help the development of its partners. Such success is worth noting. Every day we receive and experience a lot of painful news. The war continues, Russian shelling does not stop for a single day. Today there were regular strikes at Mykolaiv - missiles, artillery. The occupiers once again hit Kharkiv and the communities of the region - Staryi Saltiv, Zolochiv, Bayrak and others. There are victims - wounded and killed. In Donbas, offensive attempts do not stop, the situation there does not get easier, and the losses do not get smaller. We must remember this. We must see this, draw attention to this. And it should also be remembered that even in such conditions, the state takes steps forward - in cooperation with partners - in institutional development. And, of course, on the frontline. The occupiers have already felt very well what modern artillery is, and they will not have a safe rear anywhere on our land, which they occupied. They have felt that the operations of our reconnaissance officers to protect their Homeland are much more powerful than any of their \"special operations\". Russian soldiers - and we know this from interceptions of their conversations - are truly afraid of our Armed Forces. 139 days of such a war, almost 20 weeks... The so-called second army of the world is afraid of Ukrainians and is able to do something only on the basis of bottomless stocks of old Soviet weapons. They no longer have strategic strength, character, or understanding of what they are doing here on our land. They also don’t have even an iota of courage to admit defeat and withdraw troops from Ukrainian territory. Today in Kyiv, I held talks with Mariusz Błaszczak, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of Poland. And he brought us \"Krabs\" - those that will powerfully feed our enemy with fire. Of course, the key topic of our negotiations was further defense cooperation. But it is important not only what we talked about, but also how we talked. With absolute confidence in the Ukrainian future. In the Ukrainian European future. The same goes for all my other negotiations. It is always felt. A really difficult road is ahead. Unfortunately, it is impossible to do otherwise when you are protecting your home from a terrorist assault. But it is also clear that what lies ahead is the success of our state. Ukraine will be able to defend itself. Ukraine will be able to rebuild itself. Ukraine will be able to fulfill all its foreign policy goals. When millions of people work sincerely for this - each and every one at their own level - the result will be inevitable. And you know, for some reason I rarely thanked ordinary people who work in Ukraine. Who stay here no matter what. Who do their job every day. With faith in Ukraine, with faith in victory. Now I want to thank you all. Thank you for having you. Thank you for being with Ukraine. In the evening, as always, I signed the decree awarding our heroes. 156 warriors were awarded state awards. 56 of them - posthumously. Eternal glory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all those who fight for the future of our people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President! Ladies and Gentlemen! Almost three months ago, on April 11, I addressed the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people. I spoke then about our independence - this is the main thing that Russia wants to take away from us. It was to deprive us of our independence that Russia started this brutal war of destruction. Ukraine became the first target. And I talked about the fact that Russia plans to go further to other countries in Europe and Asia. This is its strategy. But what is its tactic? The hundred days that have passed since my address to your parliament have fully revealed Russia's tactics. Every detail of it. This is terror. And if it remains unpunished, you will see it repeated in other parts of the world, in other countries. Because tactic is something that is very easy to learn when you see it working. And various tyrannies are now looking to see if Russian tactic will work. The first tactical point - artillery takes our cities hostage. The Russian army organizes its offensive so that its howitzers and MLRS can hit ordinary residential areas of ordinary cities. For example, this was exactly the goal of the invaders in the spring, when Russian soldiers moved from the northern border of our state to our capital, in order to have the opportunity to either destroy Kyiv with artillery, or blackmail us with such destruction. The Ukrainian army has ousted the Russians from the northern territories, but the occupiers remain in the east and south of our country and build their offensive in the same way - so that ordinary houses are within the range of their howitzers and MLRS. The second point is missile terror. 2,960 missiles as of this morning - that's how much Russia managed to launch at our cities. And the main targets of missiles are civilian objects. Imagine an ordinary shopping mall or school somewhere in Incheon or Gwangju. How would you react to a large anti-ship missile hitting such targets? Which was developed to destroy aircraft carriers. And hundreds of similar strikes? Of course, this is a tactic. Russia's tactic, which is aimed at expelling people from our cities and making every Ukrainian fear the terrorist state. The third point is deportation. Just imagine this number - two million people. So many of our people have already been taken to Russia. Several hundred thousand children. No one will tell the exact numbers at the moment - all these deported people are deprived of means of communication, their documents are taken away from them, they are intimidated and taken to remote areas of Russia to make it as difficult as possible for them to return to their homeland. How will we then take our people back from all those places where people were forcibly deported? Moreover, Russia forcibly created so-called filtration camps, through which it forces people to pass in the occupied territory. Tens of thousands of people remain there. Young women disappear there. I think you all understand what is happening with them there. The fourth point of Russian tactic is an economic shock. And this concerns not only us. Look at just one example - the events in Sri Lanka. The shocking rise in food and fuel prices caused a social explosion. No one knows now how it will end. However, you all know that the same outbursts are possible in other countries affected by food and energy crises. And what led to the aggravation of these crises? Russia's cynical blockade of our seaports, which does not allow the critically important supply of Ukrainian food to the world market. And also a completely thought-out Russian game to raise energy prices. And the fifth point of Russian tactic is propaganda. Probably, no other state in the world has spent so much money on the deliberate dissemination of disinformation, anti-scientific conspiracy theories, in particular regarding vaccines, as Russia does. Is Asia free from such Russian lies? Unfortunately no. Ladies and Gentlemen! It is now 2022. No city in the world should be held hostage by artillery. Every nation terrorized by missiles should receive adequate assistance and protection from other free nations. Any attempts at deportation in today's world must receive the toughest response from the international community. Any state that blocks ports and makes the sea deadly dangerous must pay such a price for its behavior through sanctions, which will demonstrate to all potential aggressors of the world that repeating such Russian tactics is extremely unprofitable. And, finally, all the countries of the world must protect themselves from those who try to spread their influence through the \"means of mass lies.\" Russia's war against Ukraine is actually a global issue. The issue of not only the future of our nation, but also the future of dozens of other nations. Will democracy withstand the attacks of tyranny? Will humanity find effective means of responding to the deliberate terror of a larger state against a smaller state? Will such global mechanisms finally be created to protect every nation from hunger? Will we all have enough leadership to resist evil, whatever it may be, be it armed aggression or pandemic? Russian tactics must not become the global norm, and the world order must be restored. When Ukraine turns to partners for weapons for its defense and for strengthening sanctions against a terrorist state, it is not only about our defense. It's like vaccines: if you don't help other nations, you have to be prepared for new strains of the virus that will make your own defense ineffective. And I am sincerely grateful to the Republic of Korea, which realizes that this is the situation, that we should act together. And I believe that the effectiveness of joint efforts can be such that in another hundred days I can address the people of Korea again and thank them for the fact that the aggressor has really been punished, and all other potential aggressors in the world have no alternative to a normal peaceful life. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I signed a decree awarding the Order of Merit of the 1st degree to Maryna Viazovska, a Ukrainian mathematician who became a laureate of the Fields Medal this year. This is a very important and prestigious award - it is called the Nobel Prize in Mathematics. Ukrainian Mrs. Viazovska became the second woman in the entire history of the award since 1936 to win this medal. She managed to solve the problem of packing spheres in eight-dimensional space. As scientists note, Maryna Viazovska offered very powerful ideas and helped solve related problems. Today I want to thank Mrs. Maryna. Not only for her work, for a very powerful mathematical result, but also for the fact that she helps all of us, all Ukrainians, protect our freedom and independence. In particular, during the ceremony of awarding the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians, in her speech Mrs. Maryna spoke about Ukraine, about Russia's war against our country, about the crimes of the Russian occupiers. Mrs. Maryna studied in Ukraine, in Kyiv, she works in Switzerland, in Lausanne, heads the department of number theory. And I believe that the day will come when Maryna Viazovska will be able to return to Ukraine and teach here. I took part in the work of the \"Asian Leadership\" conference, which takes place every year in Seoul, the capital of the Republic of Korea. This is one of those platforms that attracts the attention of the entire region. And it is important for Ukraine that our interests and values are heard and perceived in all parts of the world, especially in the leading countries of Asia. I thanked them for their support and called for more active opposition to Russian terror tactics. And what an evil irony: today the representatives of the occupation structures in Donetsk announced that they were, as they say, recognized by the DPRK. Of course, we will react in a very tough manner at all levels. But this is the news that does not even need additional comments. Everything is obvious. The path we are taking and the path the occupiers can lead to. Debris clearance continues after the Russian attack on the city of Chasiv Yar. As of this time, the list of the dead includes 48 people, including one child. Unfortunately, the number of those rescued has not changed - 9 people. Rescuers will work on site until all debris is cleared. It was one of the most brutal Russian strikes during the entire war - so many victims... My condolences to the relatives and friends of the victims. I am preparing to address the participants of the forum in The Hague in the Netherlands, which will be held tomorrow and dedicated to the prosecution of Russian war criminals. World democracies are willing to do everything necessary to make every Russian terrorist responsible for evil against Ukrainians. And we must coordinate our efforts in such a way that all the guilty receive fair sentences. There will be a tribunal. Today in the news there are many references to the meeting in Turkey regarding the unblocking of agricultural exports from our country through the Black Sea. We are indeed making significant efforts to restore the supply of food to the world market. And I am grateful to the United Nations and Turkey for their respective efforts. The success of this story is needed not only by our state, but also, without exaggeration, by the whole world. If we manage to remove the Russian threat to navigation in the Black Sea, it will remove the severity of the world food crisis. The Ukrainian delegation informed me that there is some progress. We will agree on the details with the UN Secretary General in the coming days. In the evening, as usual, I signed the decree awarding our warriors. 136 combatants were awarded state awards, 25 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to everyone who protects our country! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear conference participants, Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and take part in a conference whose purpose, frankly speaking, is to save international law. Because right now it depends precisely on our joint efforts whether humanity will have such a tool as international law at all. Whether humanity will live in chaos and constant violence from those who believe that force allegedly decides everything and that aggression allegedly allows any wishes of tyrants to be served under the guise of law. In a few days, on July 17, it will already be 8 years since one of the most terrible air disasters in history - shooting down of MH17 flight. Then, Russian criminals killed 298 people in the sky over the Ukrainian Donbas. The world, seeing that crime, realized what is happening in Ukraine. Realized what aggression Russia came with to our country. The shooting down of MH17 attracted global attention. All the world's media, politicians and societies felt the pain of the families who lost their loved ones in that disaster. 80 children died, among them three babies... It is impossible to forget the photos of children's toys found on the ground among the wreckage of the Boeing. Time passes by, that tragedy is talked about less and less. But justice does its job. Ukraine, the Netherlands, all our partners, experts and investigators managed to establish a complete picture of what happened to MH17. And I have no doubt that everyone who committed that terrible crime will receive a fair punishment. However, we must remember why that crime became possible. We must remember that it is neither the only one nor random. That catastrophe became just one of many catastrophes and tragedies caused by the primary Russian crime – armed aggression against Ukraine. It all started in 2014. And it continues to this day. Taking the lives of our people every day. This morning, Russian missiles hit our city of Vinnytsia. An ordinary peaceful city. Cruise missiles hit two public buildings. Residential buildings were destroyed, the medical center was on fire. Cars and trams were on fire. This is an audacious act of Russian terror. People couldn't do that. They are beasts! Eight missiles, two of which hit downtown. As of this moment, 20 people died, among them three children, a large number of wounded... I ask you now to honor with a moment of silence the memory of all those killed by Russian crimes - from 2014 to this day, all those who were killed by Russia on our Ukrainian land and in the Ukrainian sky. Thank you. I am grateful to you for honoring the memory of the victims of Russian aggression with me. Just feel it: we do it every day. Because every day, every day, our people die, children die. Due to Russian aggression, tens of thousands of Ukrainians were killed, tortured and maimed. Millions were deported to Russia or made homeless by hostilities. It is still being established how many children Russian forces abducted and took out of Ukraine... The preliminary figure is dreadful - about two hundred thousand children. The world saw what happened in Mariupol and Bucha. The world sees Russian missile terror. Literally live, everyone can see Russian artillery burning down cities in Donbas and destroying civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv and in the south of our country. Only since the start of the full-scale invasion on February 24, the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine have registered 34 thousand 39 crimes related to Russian aggression. This is slightly less than in 5 months. And imagine how many crimes the Russian occupiers have committed since 2014... And for this primary, initial crime of armed aggression, there must be mandatory and principled punishment for all Russian criminals. Ukrainian justice will do the part of the work that the national jurisdiction allows. I believe that the International Criminal Court will inevitably ensure the liability of those guilty of crimes under its jurisdiction: war crimes, crimes against humanity, the crime of genocide. And I am grateful to all our partners who support us along the way. By the way, to help the investigation - both Ukrainian and international - we launched the \"Book of Torturers of the Ukrainian People\" project. This project allows you to collect evidence of war crimes and data about those who committed them on an online platform. In today's world, this and similar digital and communication tools significantly accelerate the work of the investigation. But the existing judicial institutions for jurisdictional reasons cannot bring to justice all those guilty of the primary crime of aggression. That is why we need a Special Tribunal regarding this crime - Russian aggression against Ukraine. A Tribunal that will ensure the fair and lawful punishment of those who started this history of disasters and tragedies, which has become the biggest war in Europe since World War II. Our efforts will be enough to record the crimes of the Russian occupiers; to gather all the evidence so that it is absolutely admissible in the courts; to establish each of the guilty. However, those people whose decisions led to this array of crimes must not hide behind the so-called immunity of officials. The principle of inevitability of punishment must also apply to these people. And this can only be ensured by the Special Tribunal on Aggression against Ukraine. And in addition to such a Tribunal, an instrument for compensation for all damages caused by aggression is also needed. Time is merciless and plays into the hands of Russia. People can't wait long for justice. If justice is delayed, people feel as if there is no justice. Today, the world no longer recalls the terrible Russian crimes that were committed at the beginning of the aggression against our state - back in 2014 and 2015. Now the feelings in the world about Mariupol, about \"Azovstal\", about Bucha are completely different - much less intense. Of course, people have not changed their assessment of these and other crimes. However, to ensure a feeling that justice is being restored, it is necessary not only to punish the guilty. It is necessary to give the victims of crimes full assistance and to rebuild everything destroyed by this aggression. The aggressor must lose both on the battlefield and at the level of meanings, so that the war becomes a heavy loss, first of all, for the aggressor, not for the victims. Please pay attention - the same group of people is behind all the thousands of crimes committed during Russia's war against Ukraine. Those who give criminal orders. Those who always tell the same lies. Those who have been thinking for nine years already how to make it worse and more painful for everyone around them, how to cause more losses to other states and nations. The life and wealth of this group of people is ensured by other individuals and legal entities. By the assets registered on them. By the property they own openly or secretly. By the money they hid in different jurisdictions and in different forms - private, state or quasi-state. Therefore, Ukraine proposed to create a special compensation mechanism. We believe that compensation for the damage caused by Russian aggression can be ensured at the expense of Russian assets and funds located outside the borders of Russia - in other jurisdictions. And we must understand that the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine is an extremely complex project that can become successful with the help of partners. And the sooner the compensation mechanism starts working, the more effectively the assets of the terrorist state will be converted into compensation, and the less financial burden our partners will bear. And now I would like to thank Canada and other countries that are working to make their legislation allow for this kind of reimbursement process. We have to make it global - so that no one in the world will think again that aggression against a sovereign state contrary to international law can be tolerable for the aggressor. We need just such a global legal path, which will reflect one of our common values - the rule of law. Ladies and Gentlemen! Justice must always do its job. And our task, the task of all politicians, is to give justice the necessary tools. The power of the law, its supremacy is ensured only when there are effective and stable institutions capable of implementing the law in any conditions. We know what institutions we need. We can create them. And they will definitely work. And this will be a contribution to the protection of the world order, the world legal order, that can be compared only to the Nuremberg trials. This is our joint task. I thank you for your help! I thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Today I am addressing not Ukrainian men and women, as usual, but our partners. Democratic world. This day once again proved that Russia must be officially recognized as a terrorist state. No other state in the world poses such a terrorist threat as Russia. No other state in the world allows itself to destroy peaceful cities and ordinary human life with cruise missiles and rocket artillery every day. As a result of just one missile attack on our city of Vinnytsia, 23 people were killed. Three children under the age of ten. And this, unfortunately, is not yet the final number. Debris clearance is ongoing. Dozens of people are listed as missing. Heavily wounded are among those hospitalized. One of the missiles destroyed the Neuromed medical center. There were people inside. Nataliya, she is 40 years old. Tetiana, she is 32 years old. Volodymyr, he is 61 years old. Vira, she is 55 years old. I saw them among the missing. You see, it was not even known what happened to the people who simply went to the medical center... And if someone launched a missile attack on a medical center in Dallas or Dresden, God forbid, what would it be called? Wouldn’t it be called terrorism? A girl is among the dead today in Vinnytsia, she was four years old, her name was Liza. The child was four years old! Her mother is in critical condition... Russia ended the girl's life just at the time when a conference on Russian war crimes was taking place in the Netherlands, in The Hague. A conference where it was decided what should be done to ensure that every Russian military is punished. Can you think of any other terrorist organization that would allow itself such audacity? To kill just at the moment when its previous crimes are the subject of international discussion. Russia has thus shown its attitude to international law, to Europe, and to the entire civilized world. After that, no one can have any doubt that a Special Tribunal on Russian aggression against Ukraine is needed as soon as possible. Also, a special compensation mechanism must be implemented as soon as possible, with the help of which all Russian assets and funds in all countries of the world must be confiscated and aimed at compensations for the victims of Russian terror. It is absolutely necessary to implement as soon as possible such restrictions against Russian energy exports, which will not allow terrorists to cover their costs at the expense of the international community. And I want to emphasize: all this is needed not only by Ukraine, not only by our citizens, whose lives are under threat of Russian terror. This is needed by all of you, everyone in the world who values human life at least a little. Terror is a virus. And if one of the terrorists goes unpunished, it only encourages others. The ceremony of awarding our defenders upon whom the title of Hero of Ukraine was conferred took place this morning in Kyiv. I presented the Gold Star Orders to our warriors, as well as to the relatives of those warriors who were awarded the title of Hero posthumously. In total, during the full-scale war since February 24, the title of Hero has been awarded to 157 Ukrainians, 75 - posthumously. More than 23,000 of our defenders have been awarded state awards, more than 3,500 - posthumously. Hundreds of thousands of our warriors hold back the Russian onslaught every day and every night. Ukrainians make one of the most significant contributions in history to the the fight against terrorism. And we are grateful to everyone who helps us. To every state, international structures, public associations around the world, conscientious business, every person who cares. But the time has come for the democratic world to enshrine all this in proper legal instruments. The status of a terrorist state for Russia. The special tribunal on Russian aggression. The special compensation mechanism that will direct the funds of the terrorist state to those whom it wanted to destroy. And, of course, new sanctions for terror. New sanctions are needed as soon as possible. And finally. I want the crew of the vessel, which fired the Kalibrs on Vinnytsia today, to know for sure that prison is the best thing they may face. Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror! Eternal glory to each and every one who defends a normal peaceful life! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Ukrainian men and women! Today, the European Union announced the first details of the new, seventh sanctions package being prepared against the Russian Federation, and the task of Ukrainian diplomats is to do everything to strengthen this package. After an attack on Vinnytsia and other terrorist attacks by the Russian army, the occupiers must feel what a fair response to terror means. In particular, it will be felt thanks to sanctions. Of course, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will certainly provide their part of the answer. The occupiers will have no restful nights. The identification of all those guilty in the attack on the city of Vinnytsia has already begun. Both at the national level and at the international level, we will do everything to make absolutely all Russian murderers responsible for what they have done. The Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine reported to me today full information about the rescue operation that was run in the city. In total, almost two hundred people applied for medical help. Four people are currently in critical condition, unfortunately. Four citizens are still missing in the list. Everything is being done on the ground to clarify their fate. The death toll has not changed at this time – 23 people. The minister also briefed me on the attack of the Russian army on the city of Mykolaiv this morning. The buildings of two institutes – pedagogical and shipbuilding – have been destroyed. There are no such words in normal human language that can describe the state to which the Russian state has degraded. It is a double crime – to destroy particularly pedagogical institutes, so that there is no educational institution, and new educators cannot be trained... But let the terrorists not hope that this will give them something. We will definitely restore everything they destroyed. Each of the more than two thousand educational institutions – all kindergartens, all schools, institutes, universities. And most importantly, we will preserve our humanity and our civility. But Russian society with so many murderers and executioners will remain crippled for generations, and through its own fault. The United States of America is preparing a defense budget for the new fiscal year - with supplemental assistance to Ukraine. In particular, it is about expanding the capabilities of our military aviation. This and other US assistance to our country will significantly strengthen our defense potential. It is important. I want to once again express my gratitude to the American people, President Biden, the US Congress for all the support we receive. By the way, only in the last two weeks, $3 billion were transferred to the Ukrainian budget from the United States of America, and this enables us to ensure the current social needs of Ukrainians today. America is truly a leader in the global defense of freedom. Right now, as I am writing this address, the air alert is over almost the entire territory of our state. There is preliminary information about strikes - Dnipro, Kremenchuk, Kyiv region. The occupiers realize that we are gradually becoming stronger, and the goal of their terror is very simple – to put pressure on you and me, on our society, to intimidate people, to cause as much as possible damage to Ukrainian cities, while Russian terrorists are still able to do it. So I'm begging you, once again: please don't ignore the air alert signals now. Appropriate rules of conduct must be followed at all times, especially at public objects. Of course, we will come to the day when Russian terror will become impossible. But it still needs time. We still have to fight. And we will fight. Today, I signed a new decree on awarding our soldiers. A total of 242 combatants were honored by state awards. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for you and me, for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to all who defend our state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Ukrainian men and women! On this day, 32 years ago, the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine was endorsed. It was the first document of this kind after many years, which confirmed the right of our people to live independently. Independently and in a democratic way. The specific points of the Declaration reflected the realities of that time and the hopes that prevailed in our society. 32 years later, after eight years of war in Donbas and on the 143rd day of the full-scale war against Russia, it may seem that the text of the Declaration could be different, particularly from a security point of view. But at that time this text was also of a revolutionary character. The Declaration restored the tradition of Ukrainian state-establishing, and it was on its basis that the Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine was later adopted. And today, when our people are fighting for independence, we have our right in every sense of the word – historically, politically, culturally and, what is very important – legally. In particular, our people's confidence in victory is based on this. Ukraine has withstood Russia's brutal blows. We have already managed to liberate part of the territory that was occupied after February 24. We will gradually liberate other regions of our state that are currently under the occupation. During such a war, we were able to obtain the status of the EU candidate. We have maintained the stability of public institutions. The power system was rebuilt to work in the power grid of the European continent. All logistical processes in the state – military and economic – were rechanneled. And most importantly, we maintain internal unity, having overcome conflicts and contradictions that had hindered us in the past. We must all remember the cost of mistakes and discord that made it difficult for previous generations to achieve the results we have today. We must remember how much our people had to go through until it became possible to restore Ukraine's sovereignty and independence. But our time has added one more thing to everything that path strewn teaches. It's very important. This did not happen before. Never in the past, as much as now, it did not depend on the ability of Ukrainians to be very careful and circumspect in the information field. Even today showed how important it is that we take care of Ukraine and each other in what we say and how we experience this time. How many people were scared today by a fake about a massive Russian missile attack on Ukraine? After everything that happened in the previous weeks. After the Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Chasiv Yar... How many headaches are given every day by the production of horror stories from Russian propagandists and officials... How many problems Ukrainians create for themselves by trusting any anonymous source... This sometimes takes on simply unhealthy forms when social networks and websites deliberately stuff fake information from Russia, the purpose of which is only one – to add media terror to the missile and artillery terror against our country. Therefore, we also need a kind of emotional sovereignty so that we do not depend on what the enemy constantly launches against you and me. In order not to play along with the media game against Ukraine. To have the power to consciously perceive any information, any messages, no matter who they come from. And to see who needs them and for what, and whether Ukraine needs them in particular, whether they make the path to victory easier for you and me. Sometimes media weapons can do more than conventional weapons. It is obvious that any missiles and artillery of Russia will not succeed in breaking our unity and knocking us off our path. And it should be equally obvious that Ukrainian unity cannot be broken by lies or intimidation, fake information or conspiracy theories. We will stand. We will win. We will win back our, rebuild our lives. We will do it together – that's the only way it can be done. This can be done only without mutual competition. This is our obligation to all generations of our people who fought for our freedom and sovereignty of Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who is fighting for the state of Ukraine, who is working for victory and who is defending our people. Let's hold on. Only together! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I was informed of the results of another operation against criminals who worked for the enemy. Employees of the State Bureau of Investigation together with the Security Service of Ukraine detained the former head of the Main Directorate of the Security Service of Ukraine in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. This person was dismissed by me at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, and as we can see, that decision was completely justified. Sufficient evidence has been collected to notify this person of suspicion of treason. All his criminal activities are documented. Everything he has done during these months as well as earlier will get a proper legal assessment. Everyone who together with him was part of a criminal group that worked in the interests of the Russian Federation will also be held accountable. It is about the transfer of secret information to the enemy and other facts of cooperation with the Russian special services. I want to thank everyone who participated in this operation. It can truly be called self-purification. I visited the frontline regions - the most difficult ones. I personally dealt with the activities of the law enforcement agencies in particular. As a result of this, as you already know, personnel decisions were made regarding the regional heads of the security sector - Kherson, Kharkiv. We also sorted out the issues of the local leadership of the executive power. The specific actions and any inaction of each official in the security sector and in law enforcement agencies will be evaluated. The corresponding inspection of law enforcement agencies has already yielded the first results and will be continued. As of today, 651 criminal proceedings have been registered regarding treason and collaboration activities of employees of prosecutor's offices, pretrial investigation bodies, and other law enforcement agencies. In 198 criminal proceedings, relevant persons were notified of suspicion. In particular, more than 60 employees of the prosecutor's office and the Security Service of Ukraine remained in the occupied territory and are working against our state. Such an array of crimes against the foundations of the national security of the state and the connections detected between the employees of the security forces of Ukraine and the special services of Russia pose very serious questions to the relevant leadership. Each of these questions will receive a proper answer. Today I made a decision to suspend the Prosecutor General from office and the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine from discharging duties. I want to be heard today by everyone on whom the extremely sensitive issue of appointing a new head of the Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office depends. My position as the President of Ukraine is that the competition that took place should lead to a completely logical decision on the appointment of a new head. The appropriate person was selected, and the finalization of this decision depends on the competition commission. Why is this issue sensitive? The answer is obvious. Without a full-fledged head of such an institution, its full--fledged functioning is impossible. By the way, the same applies to the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine. The term of office of the previous head has ended. And there should be a competition procedure for the selection of a new head of NABU. I instructed the Prime Minister of Ukraine to intensify the process of launching the relevant competition. I know that the employees of the anticorruption infrastructure perform their duties at this time and in such conditions. Moreover, they participate in the defense of our state. In particular, seven NABU employees received state awards after February 24. However, the full functionality of any state body can be used only when there is an effective leader. So, this competition is also extremely important. Today, another not-too-sober statement about the alleged \"doomsday\" for Ukraine was heard from Russia. Of course, no one will perceive such intimidation. But look how cynical it is to say such a thing today - on the anniversary of Russia's shooting down of the Malaysian Boeing in the sky over the Ukrainian Donbas. 298 people were killed in an obvious act of terrorism. 80 children. Citizens of ten states. Already then, Russia was following this path - to the status of a terrorist state and to a special tribunal, which will definitely take place regarding Russian aggression against Ukraine. This will be a doomsday for Russia. And not in a figurative sense, not as a loud saying, but literally. As of 19:00 today, Russia has already used more than three thousand cruise missiles against Ukraine. It is impossible to count the number of artillery and other projectiles that were used against our country and our people. But it is definitely possible to bring all Russian war criminals to justice. Each of the collaborators. All those responsible for terror. For everything that happens during 144 days and in more than eight years. It will be done. I spoke today with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. Of course, we discussed our cooperation and I thanked him, I thanked Canada for its support. But I separately emphasized that Ukrainians will never accept Canada's decision regarding the Nord Stream turbine, which was decided to be handed over to Germany in violation of the sanctions regime. This issue is not just about the turbine. This is a matter of compliance with sanctions. If there is one violation now, it is only a matter of time before there will be others. Russia deliberately does this blackmailing with gas and provoking violations of sanctions. There are enough routes for the transit of Russian gas to Europe. And every country must maintain principles. I am grateful to everyone who fights and defends justice. I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, a photo of a guy from Mariupol, who went out to the streets of the city with a Ukrainian flag, went viral. He came to the remains of the drama theater building destroyed by Russian troops. This was very brave. And I want to thank him for this act. This guy is one of many of our people who are waiting for the return of Ukraine and who will not accept the occupation under any circumstances. Russia keeps most of them in an information vacuum. Every day in the occupied territories it spreads new lies about Ukraine and our actions. But despite propaganda and intimidation, people not only remember Ukraine, but also demonstrate what they really think and what they strive for. We never forgot about them. And I ask all of you who have contacts and opportunities for this: spread real information to the occupied territory, support our people, spread the truth there. In any way you find effective. On our entire Ukrainian land from Kherson to Horlivka, from Henichesk to the occupied districts of the Kharkiv region, in Melitopol and Berdyansk, in Enerhodar, in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, in Crimea, our people should hear about Ukraine from Ukrainians. The Armed Forces of our state managed to inflict significant logistical losses on the invaders. It is increasingly difficult for the Russian army to hold positions on the captured territory. Step by step, we advance, disrupt supplies for the occupiers, identify and neutralize collaborators. The prospect is obvious: the Ukrainian flag will be in all our cities and villages. The only question is time. And while this time lasts, while Russia can still destroy life in Ukraine, as it did today with strikes at Nikopol, Toretsk, cities in the Kharkiv region, do not forget to provide information and emotional support to our people in the occupied areas. Tell them about Ukraine. For its part, the state does this. But we must use all the information power of our society. As of today, 1,028 settlements were liberated from the occupiers. Another 2,621 are still under the control of the invaders. And we must maintain information communication with all of them - with all where there are people. As much as possible. I spoke today with President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro about the long-term consequences of the Russian war against Ukraine, the sanctions policy, and the issue of our bilateral relations. And one more important news regarding the Security Service of Ukraine. Personnel audit of the Service is taking place. The issue of dismissal of 28 officials is being considered. Different levels, different directions. But the grounds are similar - unsatisfactory job performance. I am thankful to everyone who faithfully and effectively serves the state! I am thankful to everyone who defends Ukrainian interests at their level. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Every day, the occupiers give new reasons for recognizing Russia as a terrorist state. Last night, they carried out a missile attack on a village in the Odesa region - 7 sea-based \"Kalibr\" missiles against an ordinary village. These are not cheap or simple missiles - Russia was very proud of them. And what did they hit? An ordinary rural field and a non-working farm, rural houses, outbuildings, a lyceum, a cultural center. No military sense. Just terror. Fortunately, there were no casualties - people reacted in time to the air-raid warning signal. But six locals were injured, including a 5-month-old child. She and her mother are given all the necessary aid. These are the targets of Russian cruise missiles. And what kind of wimp do you have to be to fulfill commands for such missile strikes at peaceful villages and cities? Even fish and rapana in the Black Sea have more dignity than the officers of the Russian fleet. Over the past day, the targets for Russian shelling were also Nikopol and other settlements of the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Kharkiv region, Mykolaiv, Kramatorsk - a cruise missile hit the center of the city, Slovyansk, Toretsk and other cities of Donbas. Many casualties, many wounded... The occupiers shelled the border areas of the Sumy region. At the captured Zaporizhzhia NPP and in Enerhodar there are new facts of terror against workers and local residents... No matter how the occupiers try to hide, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and our intelligence will ensure retaliatory strikes and our state will identify every Russian criminal who is guilty in the terror of Ukrainians. Increasing American support for Ukraine, additional assistance to protect people from Russian terror, addressing humanitarian needs are all the tasks of the ongoing visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to the United States. Today, on the second day of the visit, a meeting at the White House with First Lady Jill Biden took place - President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband came to greet the First Lady of Ukraine. I am grateful to the presidential couple of the United States, all representatives of the American Administration and every American family for their warmth towards our country and our people. And I expect from this visit of the First Lady significant results for Ukraine in cooperation with America. It is important right now. There have already been meetings with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, with Samantha Power and other influential female politicians representing the government and parliamentary structures of America. Tomorrow Olena will speak in the Congress - on behalf of all Ukrainian mothers, all Ukrainian women, and it will be an important address. And I really believe that it will be heard by those on whom decision-making in the US depends. Today I had phone conversations with three leaders. I informed President of Poland Andrzej Duda about the situation on the frontline. We discussed further steps in countering Russian aggression. I spoke with Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi. I thanked him for his honest and principled position in defense of our common European values. In the evening, I also spoke with the President of Côte d'Ivoire. I informed him about our efforts to counter the food crisis, which was created by Russia and which threatens the world with large-scale hunger. The renewal of the power vertical of the state is in progress. Today I appointed new heads of regional offices of the Security Service of Ukraine in the Zakarpattia, Poltava, Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions. I also dismissed one of the deputy heads of the Security Service of Ukraine. I am grateful to the members of the competition commission on the election of the head of the Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office for finalizing the competition. The decision on the winner has been approved. A new Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine - Oksana Zholnovych - was appointed as well. I expect her to be more active in explaining to people all the nuances of state social policy - specific people's rights, payment mechanisms and other opportunities provided by the state. It is also necessary to speed up the modernization of the regulatory framework for social policy, and the role of the minister in this should be significant. It is very important that today the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine implemented the initiative of Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak to set up a special commission to control the use of weapons provided by our partners. The commission included representatives of all parliamentary factions and groups. I want to emphasize: there is no ground for any claims to our state in this regard. Our partners are fully informed about how we use the weapons provided. But in order to put an end to any manipulations of Russian propagandists and those who help them in Ukraine or somewhere else, such an additional parliamentary control tool will enter into force. I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 185 servicemen were awarded state awards, five of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to all who defend and strengthen our state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! I'm sure you've seen how effective the weapons provided by the partners are, especially modern MLRS. The name HIMARS has become almost native to our people - just like Javelin or NLAW, like \"Stugna\" or \"Neptune\" earlier. And it is obvious that the next equally important name will appear from modern air defense systems, which we are requesting from partners. The representatives of our state did not stop working for a single day to obtain an effective air defense system. And we have certain agreements on this, there is certain success that allows us to destroy part of the missiles, but a completely different speed and scale of protection is required. But everything depends, unfortunately, not on us, but on political decisions that can be made in key capitals. And that is why this topic of air defense became key today in the speech of the First Lady of Ukraine in the Congress of the United States of America. It was the first time in history that the First Lady made such an address to the Congress, and it is certainly an honor for Ukraine, for all our people. The speech was as practical and sincere as possible - actually on behalf of all our families. Olena spoke about the victims of Russian terror and about the real opportunity for our American friends to help us stop this terror. This can be our joint victory - of the Ukrainian and American nations. I am hopeful that the answers to our requests will be provided shortly. Russian terror must lose. Today, I discussed the issue of increasing pressure on Russia for the war and additional support for Ukraine during a meeting with the Foreign Ministers of Austria and the Czech Republic who visited Kyiv. I thanked both countries for the assistance already provided and outlined the needs for the near future. The Czech Republic holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and it is therefore important that the Czech leadership retains all available power. During these six months, we must take basic steps to prepare for the beginning of negotiations regarding Ukraine's membership in the EU. I also spoke with President of the European Council Charles Michel. Financial support for Ukraine is among the main topics. We are preparing for the next Ukraine-EU Summit, as well as for the institutional strengthening of our state on the path to the European Union. Soon there may be important news in this regard - we are preparing some historic decisions for our participation in the life of a united Europe. The seventh sanctions package of the European Union is in the final stage of approval. Its elements have already been announced, including a ban on the import of Russian gold. But this is not enough, and I frankly tell my partners about it. Russia must feel a much higher price for the war so that it forces it to seek peace. And now it is worth looking at what is happening on the European energy market. We see how erroneous the policy of some old leaders of European countries, who made Europe hostage to gas supplies from Russia, was. And while the EU does not dare include gas in the sanctions packages, Russia uses gas for its own sanctions against every European family, literally hitting the family budgets of Europeans with pressure on the energy markets. Ukraine has always said that Russia cannot be considered a reliable supplier of gas. And if our position had been listened to earlier, there would be no need now to look for emergency ways to fill the deficit that Russia is artificially creating on the European market. When we turn to our partners with this or that request, with this or that advice or demand, it is based on the experience of Ukraine - on what we have already experienced. Russia is testing in Ukraine everything that can be used against other European countries. It started with gas wars and ended with a full-scale invasion, missile terror and burned cities of Ukraine. And so that this does not happen to anyone else, we must ensure a tangible joint victory over Russia in Ukraine. The sooner this is done, the less damage and suffering will be experienced by all European families, all European countries. Therefore, after the approval of the seventh package of sanctions, it will be necessary to immediately start working on the eighth. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the supply of modern weapons to Ukraine, to provide our state with effective air defense. We will do everything so that our partners have this understanding and for it to never weaken. I am grateful to everyone who helps Ukrainians on the way to victory! I am grateful to everyone who defends our country! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief - this format of our work brings together key leaders of the defense and security sectors. We listened to the reports of Head of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine Kyrylo Budanov, Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service Oleksandr Lytvynenko, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhny, Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, as well as Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrskyi. Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander of the Land Forces, joined the Staff meeting directly from the frontline. We discussed the current situation on the frontline, around Ukraine. We defined tasks in some tactical areas to strengthen our positions. And we also thoroughly worked out the issue of providing the troops with the modern weapons - the intensity of attacks on the enemy still needs to be increased. The participants of the Staff meeting agreed that we have a significant potential for the advance of our forces on the front and for the infliction of significant new losses on the occupiers. Today, Head of my Office Andriy Yermak and General Zaluzhny had another conversation with US President's National Security Advisor Jacob Sullivan and United States Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley. In this two-on-two format, all key issues of cooperation in the defense sphere between Ukraine and the United States are constantly discussed. I held negotiations with the President of Costa Rica - for the first time in the history of relations between our states. I thanked him for his support of Ukraine - it is felt, for countering Russian propaganda and the introduction of sanctions. And I will continue to do everything possible so that the truth about Russia's actions against Ukraine is known in every part of the world. Our diplomacy is constantly creating new ties with countries that have not been the focus of Ukrainian foreign policy for a long time. And tomorrow we also expect news for our state from Turkey - regarding the unblocking of our ports. Against the background of such regular military-political and diplomatic activity, it was a little strange to hear today an old-new fake of Russian propaganda about me. That I am allegedly in an intensive care unit, that Ruslan Stefanchuk is allegedly performing the duties of the head of state. Well, what can I say... Earlier, almost every week, Russian propagandists and officials spreaded fakes that I allegedly fled somewhere from Ukraine or that I allegedly did not fulfill my duties. Then it all stopped. And here such primitive things are thrown in again. It seems that the occupiers are even running out of ammunition of lies - they are unable to come up with anything new. The existing potential for all forms of Russian aggression will certainly be exhausted as well, including for offensive actions on the front and terror against our cities. We will do everything to speed it up. And this is exactly what we emphasize in all contacts with our partners. Today, the Russian army again shelled the Saltivka district of Kharkiv with rocket artillery - purely civilian objects. Residential building, trade pavilions, public transport. As of this time, three people are known to have died, and more than twenty people are on the list of wounded. The occupiers also fired at the Slovyansk community in Donbas with \"Uragans\" and hit Kramatorsk with \"Iskanders\". And each of these Russian strikes is an argument for Ukraine to receive more HIMARS and other modern and effective weapons. Each of these shelling occasions only strengthens our desire to defeat the occupiers - it will certainly happen. A few months ago, our expert group chaired by Yermak and McFaul suggested recognizing Russia's actions against Ukraine as genocide. And here is the first real result of the visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to the United States - Senators Risch, Cardin, Wicker, Blumenthal, Portman, Shaheen and Graham presented a draft resolution on recognition of Russia's actions in Ukraine as genocide. The resolution states that Russia's actions in Ukraine, which include forced deportation to Russia and the targeted killing of Ukrainian civilians during mass atrocities, are genocide against the people of Ukraine. The senators introduced the resolution shortly after Olena delivered an address directly to the US Congress. According to the draft document, the US Senate condemns Russia for committing acts of genocide against the people of Ukraine; calls on the United States, together with NATO and EU allies, to support the government of Ukraine to prevent further acts of Russian genocide against the Ukrainian people; supports tribunals and international criminal investigations to hold Russian political leaders and military personnel accountable for war of aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. With all its terrorist attacks against Ukrainians and our country, Russia is only burying itself. In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 186 combatants were awarded state awards. Eternal gratitude to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainian men and women! Dear all our defenders. Today, our state and the entire civilized world have reached an important agreement – we have an agreement that allows us to unblock Ukrainian ports and restore Ukrainian agricultural exports. From the first day of the full-scale invasion, Russia did everything to not just close Ukraine's access to the sea, but to destroy the very potential of our exports – port infrastructure, our railways, warehouses and silos. We did not allow it. And now we can not only restore the operation of our ports on the Black Sea, but also keep them protected. This has been worked out with our military and with our intelligence. The military assured me of one hundred percent control of the approaches to our ports. For a long time, all the details of the initiative signed today in Istanbul were discussed with our key international partners and the United Nations. Many leaders were involved in helping to restore our exports by sea. And I am grateful to UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for their efforts. The text of the document signed today is published, and everyone can read its points. They fully meet the interests of Ukraine. First. About 20 million tonnes of last year's grain harvest will be exported. And also it will be possible to sell this year's harvest – and it is already being harvested. These are the incomes of farmers, the entire agricultural sector and the state budget. These are jobs. These are funds for next year's sowing season. We now have approximately $10 billion worth of grain. Secondly. Finally, there is a chance to reduce the severity of the food crisis provoked by Russia. There is a chance to prevent a global catastrophe – a famine that could lead to political chaos in many countries of the world, in particular in the countries that help us. And the thirdly. This is another illustration that Ukraine is able to withstand this war. It is important that everything in the territorial waters of Ukraine will be controlled by our state. And it is clear to everyone that there may be some provocations on the part of Russia, some attempts to discredit Ukrainian and international efforts. But we trust the UN. Now, it is their responsibility and responsibility of international partners to ensure compliance with the agreements. And I want to thank all our soldiers who cleared Snake Island from the enemy, defend Odesa and Mykolaiv, gradually advance in Kherson region, liberating our territory. I'm thankful to all of you who proves every day: Russia will not win this war. We are preparing for the start of the second Kyiv Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen tomorrow. This initiative of the First Lady of Ukraine was founded last year and proved that it can turn the soft power of the wives and husbands of the leaders of the states to solving various problems of national and global scale. This year's summit will be devoted to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. And it's not just about reconstruction. It is about the return of people, that is, about displaced people who should not become refugees. About all the necessary help and rehabilitation for those who suffered from the war. And about the revival of social life in communities and cities that were destroyed by the occupiers. In particular, within the framework of the Summit and on the basis of our public charity platform United24, fundraising for specialized ambulances for Ukraine has already begun. I won't reveal everything prepared by the First Lady of Ukraine and her team, but I feel that it will be a powerful event from a diplomatic point of view. I spoke today with a great friend of Ukraine, Boris Johnson. First of all, about security and defense cooperation. We are waiting for a new package of military support. Relations between Ukraine and the UK are built on common values. And no matter what happens in politics, the ties between our countries and societies will only strengthen. In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our soldiers. 180 combatants were given state awards, 100 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for the independence of Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who fight for our country! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear First Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Ladies and gentlemen presidents! Dear guests of the Summit! Dear all our native Ukrainians! I am extremely pleased to be here today, to participate with you in the opening of the second Kyiv Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen. Olena just said how important it is that during the war we keep up the pace of our activity and do not give in to the circumstances. 150 days. After eight years. The war did not break Ukraine and will not break it, did not stop life in our country and will not stop it. And it will definitely not make us hostages of the terror that the invaders brought to our beautiful, peaceful and strong state. The main topic of this Summit is the post-war recovery of Ukraine, the human dimension of this recovery. Why are we talking about reconstruction now, when the war is not yet over? So that on the first day of peace you can feel it fully. So that there was already a systematic reconstruction of everything that was destroyed by the Russian army. So that there are already security guarantees for our people. So that people already know where and how they can return if they went abroad to escape hostilities. So that the medical system restores its strong capacity. So that parents do not have any unanswered questions about education, first of all for their children. So that people know for sure that there are jobs for them in Ukraine and there is a choice of how to express themselves. And that all our respectable men and women veterans, who have gone through the hell of battles, really feel the gratitude of our state. I just met at Bankova Street with the congressmen of the United States of America, who came to support us and you, all Ukrainians, in the fight for the main thing – for freedom. The delegation was led by Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Adam Smith. And it was felt that our conversation about the further increase of aid was a continuation of all our previous talks and, in particular, the meetings of the First Lady of Ukraine in Washington. We see that the address of the First Lady of Ukraine in the U.S. Congress was also heard – there is activity both regarding weapons for Ukraine and regarding the legal response to what Russia is doing against our independence and our state. Today, this important Summit will contribute to the protection of the state and overcoming the consequences of Russian terrorist attacks. We are harnessing the power of our society and seeing results. Ukraine has the largest global support in its history - our anti-war coalition includes dozens of countries: from Canada to New Zealand, from Japan and the United States to the UK and every friendly country in Europe. We have established the kind of connections with our partners that allow us already five months to oppose an army that has been building for the purpose of our destruction for decades. We are building new relations with many countries of the world. Contacts with the countries of Africa and Latin America were intensified only during these months. Many of them are at this level for the first time: Guatemala, Ecuador, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Mozambique, Cote d'Ivoire, etc. The President of Indonesia – one of the largest Islamic countries in the world and the leader in ASEAN – visited Kyiv for the first time. Ukraine participated three times in the G7 meetings, we have an invitation to the G20 summit. We started a new form of diplomatic activity – systematic and large-scale appeals to the parliaments and peoples of the world. And they showed that it can be more powerful than all other forms of conventional diplomacy. We also launched a fundamentally new public charity platform, UNITED24, which helps to unite the potential of different societies, civic activism on different continents of the world, efforts of business and the cultural sphere to implement specific projects for the protection and restoration of our state, which we now very much need. Outstanding people have already become Ambassadors for the UNITED24 platform, outstanding athletes Andriy Shevchenko and Elina Svitolina, actor Liev Schreiber, and now it is also the Imagine Dragons band – I spoke with them last night. Over UAH 5 billion have already been raised during the existence of our charity platform. We achieved such a result in relations with the European Union, which seemed to many to be a fantasy, when we here in Kyiv, on the fifth day of the war, signed the application for joining the EU. And now for people it is just a part of the usual reality – the fact that Ukraine is officially recognized as an EU candidate. And I believe that peace in Ukraine, and the reconstruction of our country, and the return of our beautiful people from abroad, and the further movement of our state into a united Europe will become equally common facts. Is this possible? We all don't just feel, we know that all these things are possible. And it will be so! Otherwise, this second Summit in particular would not have happened. There wouldn't be all its participants and there wouldn't be this attention that I see now. Because this is attention to the future of our Ukraine, which we will make together, which we will build despite everything, despite the war. I am sure that today in the addresses and discussions, talks at the panels of the Summit, we will be able to hear a lot of very important, useful things. This is the Summit of those whose power, though soft, is always invincible. I thank you all for participating! I thank our friends, close friends from Latvia, Lithuania, from all continents of the world, who will join us today. Thank you all! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainian men and women! The one hundred and fiftieth day of our defense against Russia, against their invasion, is coming to an end. And this day is in some ways similar to all the previous ones – missile strikes again, heavy fighting in many areas of the front – Donbas, Kharkiv region, shelling again. But this day also shows how far we have come towards our victory. It will be! First of all, we can say now about Kherson region. The occupiers tried to gain a foothold there, their collaborators made various brazen statements, which in Russian are called the very apt word \"shapkozakidatelstvo\" (false forecasts)... But how did it help them? The Armed Forces of Ukraine are advancing step by step in the region. Today's Russian missile attack on Odesa, on our port, is a cynical one, and it was also a blow to the political positions of Russia itself. If anyone in the world could still say that some kind of dialogue with it, with Russia, some kind of agreements are needed, see what is happening. Today's Russian Kalibr missiles have destroyed the very possibility for such statements. And we see the absolute unanimity of the world's reaction to this strike. The occupiers can no longer deceive anyone. Among other things, as a result of this strike, the building of the Odesa Art Museum was also damaged. The missiles hit very close to the historical objects of Odesa – something that is an asset not only for Ukrainian culture, but also for the culture of Europe. This apparent Russian barbarism brings us even closer to obtaining the very weapons we need for our victory. Today in the capital of Ukraine, I held talks with U.S. congressmen led by Adam Smith, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. And we understand each other from half a word. And this also reflects the way we have passed during all these days – days of war. By the way, I want to thank the people of the United States, President Biden for the new $270 million security assistance package. I spoke today with the President of Kazakhstan, Mr. Tokayev. I thanked him for his fundamental support for Ukraine, our sovereignty, and international law. We discussed specific projects in the fields of energy, economy, digitalization. And, finally, today the second annual Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen took place in Kyiv. This year, it gathered even more participants. It united Kyiv with Warsaw, Brussels, London, and Washington. It united top politicians, public figures of other countries and our soldiers. Representatives of business, sports, media. Writers, show business stars, educators, doctors... In today's world, it is impossible to make do with the usual conventional diplomacy. We need soft power, we need the sincere desire of different societies to help the state, which is fighting for its indomitability and independence. And from this point of view, it has become very successful today. The initiative of the First Lady of Ukraine in two years actually became a traditional format – unique for the world community. Everyone recognizes the potential of soft power. But only Ukraine managed to direct its indomitability, its potential into concrete diplomatic practice. And in general, in these almost five months, we have achieved such large-scale and diplomatic support for Ukraine that Russia will not be able to oppose it. The day will come when missiles will lose their meaning for the occupiers. Now, it is possible to shoot down some of the missiles. The goal is to shoot down each one. And we will do everything necessary to still get modern and effective air defense systems. It's our goal. The terrorist state provides new arguments for this every day. As of today, almost 24,000 defenders of Ukraine have been given state awards for their bravery. A total of 160 soldiers were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Millions of our people joined the defense of our state. And I am sincerely grateful to them, each of them. Our independence is our joint achievement. Victory will be shared. It will definitely be! I know it. I believe in it. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! An important, symbolic week begins tomorrow. The week when we will first celebrate the Day of Ukrainian Statehood on July 28. For the first time. Celebrate at the time of such a brutal war - in the sixth month of it. After eight years of war in Donbas. But we will celebrate. Despite all. Because Ukrainians cannot be broken. The Day of Ukrainian Statehood will assert the connection of Ukrainians living now with many generations of our people. The state-building experience of Ukrainians, our culture, our identity, Ukrainian character are more than a thousand years old. Now, in many exploits of our warriors, in the wisdom of our people in battles, even simply in the conversations of ordinary Ukrainians about what is happening, we can see, we can hear and understand examples of the same characters but hundreds of years ago. We can see examples of the same bravery, the same attitude to life, and most importantly, the attitude towards Ukraine and the enemy. Only those who do not know the truth of history and do not feel its meaning could decide to attack us. After all that our people have gone through, after all that we have learned over the centuries. Ukrainians will never give up their independence. And they will not break from the inside as has happened more than once. Not this time! Preserving unity now, working together for the victory is the most important national task that we all will definitely fulfill. And therefore, we will be able to do what previous generations could not do before. This applies to our defense in this war for independence, to our course towards a united Europe, towards full membership in the EU, and our ability to become one of the most modern states in the world. There is no one now who would doubt this. There are only those who argue about how to achieve this. It will happen. This is a sign of faith in Ukraine - not only our own faith. Even the occupiers admit that we will win. We hear it in their conversations – all the time, in what they tell their loved ones when they contact them. Therefore, we do not slow down and, as every day for five months, we are doing everything to inflict the greatest possible losses on the enemy and to gather as much support as possible for Ukraine. This week there will be important visits of partners, there will be important negotiations, and most importantly, there will be the further advancement of Ukrainian positions. At the front, in diplomacy, in the economy. I am grateful to everyone who defends our country! And I wish all of us, all Ukrainians, a fruitful new week. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! The visit of the President of Guatemala to Kyiv took place today - the first in all the years of our independence. And the thing is not only that we received full support from this Latin American state, but also that our relations with it are a bridge to the entire region of Latin America. Ukrainian diplomacy is gradually opening up new broad directions for our society - Central and South America, Africa, countries of the Arab world, South and Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, there was not enough attention paid to these macro-regions. And this is tangible when it is necessary to accumulate support for Ukraine, in particular on international platforms. I am grateful to Guatemala and Mr. President Giammattei, with whom I held talks today, for the principled and consistent condemnation of Russian aggression and participation in the defense of the international legal order. Crises created by Russia affect everyone in the world, and no one will manage to stay aside when Russia provokes chaos in the food market, in the energy markets or simply in international relations. Following the negotiations, I am sure that Ukraine's position will be heard in Latin America. We agreed with Mr. President on the abolition of visa restrictions and the reboot of trade and economic relations between our countries. Today we saw another gas threat to Europe. Even despite the concession regarding the Nord Stream turbine, Russia is not going to resume gas supplies to European countries, as it is contractually obligated to do. All this is done by Russia deliberately to make it as difficult as possible for Europeans to prepare for winter. And this is an overt gas war that Russia is waging against a united Europe - this is exactly how it should be perceived. And they don't care what will happen to the people, how they will suffer - from hunger due to the blocking of ports or from winter cold and poverty... Or from occupation. These are just different forms of terror. And that's why it is necessary to hit back. Do not think about the way to return some turbine, but strengthen sanctions. Do everything to limit Russian revenues not only from gas and oil, but also from any remaining exports. And sever trade ties with Russia as much as possible, because every such tie is Russia’s potential tool of putting pressure. The gas blackmail of Europe, which only gets worse every month, is needed by a terrorist state to make life worse for every European. And this can actually be perceived as an incentive for the EU's eighth sanctions package to be significantly stronger than the recently approved seventh. I have adopted important personnel decisions today. In particular, Head of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine Kyrylo Budanov will also chair the Committee on Intelligence under the President of Ukraine. Combat General Viktor Khorenko has been appointed the new Commander of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And General Hryhoriy Halahan was transferred to another direction and, with the aim of updating the Security Service of Ukraine, was appointed the First Deputy Head of the Special Operations Center \"A\" of the Security Service of Ukraine. And separately, I would like to express gratitude today to our airborne assault troops, the Sicheslav brigade, which \"landed\" two Russian military aircraft and one helicopter - in a little more than one day. We must do everything to extend such a \"landing\" experience to all Russian aircraft and missile products in our skies. Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Friend Boris! Dear members of the Churchill Society! Dear members of the Ukrainian Warrior Games team, I know that you are also there! Dear guests! It is an extraordinary honor for me to receive such a leadership award today. And, receiving it, it is very appropriate to recall one of the most famous words of Winston Churchill, which he said on May 8, 1945, after the end of the war in Europe: \"My dear friends, this is your hour. This is not victory of a party or of any class. It's a victory of the great British nation as a whole\". And now I can quite rightly say that this award is not only for me and it reflects not only my efforts. It would not be possible without all of us, it would not be possible without one hundred and sixty Ukrainian soldiers who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine for the period from February 24. It would not be possible without more than twenty-four thousand Ukrainian men and women who have been awarded our state awards for bravery in the battles against the Russian terrorist invasion. This award would not be possible if the entire Ukrainian people had not risen up to defend freedom from the attack of tyranny, as Boris said now, a tyranny that is trying to return us to the worst that happened in the XX century and that was then defeated thanks to the factor of Churchill in particular. But not only. Not only this is reflected now. Something else should be said as well. Ukrainians and European history will always remember those who did not hesitate to come to the aid of our people and the very idea of freedom. Addressing Londoners celebrating the victory, Winston Churchill recalled that Britain had stood alone for a whole year against the greatest military power of the time. And it did not quit the struggle, did not obey. And it created an example for all nations fighting against tyranny. An example of the fact that victory is possible if you remember what honor is and do not deviate from your principles. When we celebrate our victory, which we surely will, we will be able to say, thankfully, a little bit different words than those said by Sir Churchill. Because Ukraine was not left alone after February 24. With us were those who helped us, who remembered at the worst time what honor is, and who \"had no thought of quitting the struggle\". I'm talking about you now, Boris. This award is yours, too. This showed our joint leadership - Ukrainians, British and everyone who will never give up freedom to some tyrants, no matter what weapon they use against us. The price of freedom is extremely high. But still, it is incomparably higher for those who gave it up and are trying to return it than for those who protect it with all their might. We are defending. We are fighting. Just like during the terrible trials of the XX century. Just as then, the factor of personal leadership is now crucial. Leadership on the battlefield. Leadership in helping the active army. Leadership in international relations. And although the stakes in this war are different, they are no less high than 80 years ago. What are we fighting for now? Not just for the land, although for it too, of course. Not just for human rights or the right of one nation, the Ukrainians, to live independently, although for them too, of course. Not just for freedom in Europe or everywhere on the borders of Russia, although it will be guaranteed as a consequence of our victory. We are fighting together to ensure that war is never again seen by any aggressor as a means of achieving aggressive goals. And perhaps for the first time in the history of mankind we are now able to show everyone in the world and for ages that democracies, united, can stop any tyranny, even if at first it seems that it has unlimited resources for aggression. But this can become a reality only if Russia loses on the battlefield in Ukraine. That is why it is necessary to continue the supply of modern and effective weapons to our state in sufficient quantities to finally break the offensive potential of Russian tyranny. Sanctions against Russia must be strengthened and applied against all those who commit or support terror. And it is necessary to involve more nations in our coalition for the defense of freedom - especially those against whom Russia in the XXI century decided to use one of the most terrible types of weapons - hunger, artificial hunger. The democracies of the world are capable of stopping any tyranny. We are capable of stopping any evil that threatens our freedom. Only the joint leadership of the entire free world can be enough for this. And patience should be enough. Patience on the way to victory. No one knows today how much time and effort it will take to reach it. However, the victory is worth the effort. And it will become our shared history. So outstanding that you and I will later be quoted in the same way as we are now quoting Sir Churchill. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for the award - the award of the people of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Unbreakable people of the strongest country! Today, the occupiers hit the Odesa region again, firing missiles at ordinary houses again. Missiles designed to destroy warships and other significant targets. It is with such heavy weapons that the Russian army destroys the ordinary private sector near the sea. People lived and had a vacation there... And we will certainly hit back for this, no matter what lies the Russian Ministry of Defense tells about such strikes. The constant Russian terror of Kharkiv and the region, Mykolaiv, towns and villages of the Zaporizhzhia region and Dnipropetrovsk region, Donbas, border areas of the Sumy region and Chernihiv region - for all this the occupiers will not go unpnished. For four months, the Russian state has not provided to its citizens any information - even censored - about the losses of the occupation contingent. Total silence. Nothing was published or said in numerous interviews and speeches at the political and military levels. However, this number is already almost 40,000 - that is how many killed people the Russian army has lost since February 24. And tens of thousands more were wounded and maimed. And if the Russian state does not say this officially, even in general terms, everyone who still has any contacts in Russia or informational influence on their society should convey this simple fact to whomever possible. Among the occupiers only those killed are 40 thousand. Today it became known that Britain has expanded the list of sanctions against Russia. Dozens more people and organizations were added. This is the right trend, and I am grateful to Britain for its unwavering firmness in sanctions matters. This is an example that should be followed by everyone else in the Western world. In particular, today's news about another provoked increase in gas prices on the European market above 2,000 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters is already a sufficient reason to expand sanctions against Russia. Because it is clear to everyone that this is a deliberate price terror by Russia against Europe. Using Gazprom, Moscow is doing everything to make this winter the toughest for European countries. It is necessary to respond to terror - respond with sanctions. Today, for the first time in the history of interstate relations between Ukraine and Uruguay, I held negotiations with Mr. President of this Latin American country. I thanked for support in international organizations and called on Uruguay, like other states in the Latin American region, to impose sanctions on Russia. We will do everything so that there is not a single region left in the world where the truth about Russian aggression is not understood. We already have communication with Chile, Paraguay, Costa Rica. And now - Uruguay. We’ll continue this work. And a few more significant events that are worth mentioning. Today, the Winston Churchill Leadership Award ceremony was held in London with the participation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. I believe that this is an award of all our heroes, all our people, all of us who are resisting tyranny each at their own level. And it was really an honor for me to receive this award. Today, in the Netherlands - a country for the understanding of which we’ve been working for a long time - the Ukrainian people were honored with another award - a special Dutch Independence Award. Our ambassador received it on behalf of Ukrainians. These iconic things also reflect the radical changes in the attitude towards Ukraine that have taken place in the world. Our bravery is truly an inspiration for all free nations and the community of democracies in general. And just imagine how inspiring the Ukrainian victory will be. In the evening, I signed a decree awarding our warriors. 198 combatants were awarded state awards of Ukraine. Two of them – posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all those who fight for the independence of our country! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on the passing day. First of all, about the Antonivsky bridge in Kherson and other crossings in the region. Of course, they will all be rebuilt, but by us already. We are doing everything to ensure that the occupiers do not have any logistical opportunities on our land. Whatever plans they have, we will disrupt them. And we will liberate our territory with military, diplomatic and all other available means until we reach the legal borders of Ukraine. Second, today the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved the appointment of a new Prosecutor General, Andriy Kostin. The person is decent, professional, he knows how to work systematically. Society considers the provision of everything necessary to hold Russia accountable for the war as one of his most important tasks. This is cooperation with the International Criminal Court, with partner states that help identify specific culprits among the Russian military; this is the recording of the facts of the crimes committed by the occupiers, ensuring the formation of an evidentiary base for the criminal prosecution of every war criminal. The Prosecutor General's Office is one of the key institutions working to hold all Russian murderers and torturers accountable for their crimes against Ukrainians. Third, we are preparing to increase our export of electricity to consumers in the European Union. Despite such a war, we ensured the connection of the energy grid of Ukraine to the energy system of the entire Europe in record time. Our exports allow us not only to earn foreign currency, but also to help our partners withstand Russian energy pressure. We will gradually make Ukraine one of the guarantors of European energy security thanks to our domestic electricity production. Fourth, we are preparing for very important political and diplomatic events scheduled for the second half of this week. First of all, this concerns tomorrow's celebration of the Day of Ukrainian Statehood. But not only that. There will be more events, there will be more news. Every week we strengthen our state, every week we do things that bring us closer to the European Union, and every week we provide additional forces to confront Russia. Fifth, a joint meeting of the International Sanctions Group was held today under the leadership of Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul with the participation of representatives of the Ukrainian Parliament – the leadership of the Verkhovna Rada, factions and groups. New solutions are being developed that will increase the price for the war for Russia. In particular, there is an initiative to strengthen responsibility at the level of the European Union for evasion of sanctions and an initiative on mandatory disclosure of information about any business contacts, joint ownership of corporate rights and property with citizens of Russia. The Yermak-McFaul sanctions group will coordinate its work with representatives of our parliament. And one more thing. During the full-scale war, I awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to 160 Ukrainian warriors. And among them is one of the most effective Ukrainian pilots, Major Oleksandr Kukurba. In April, in the Mariyinsky Palace, in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine, I presented the Gold Star Order to him. Major Kukurba died in battle yesterday. It was his hundredth combat sortie. A real Ukrainian hero whom we will always remember. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to everyone who defends our state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "The great people of the great country and the great state, which existed on this land from time immemorial, and from time immemorial there have been attempts to both enslave and destroy it. By many people and many times. And which has not allowed it to be done from time immemorial. Never to anyone. The state in which the history of Christianity in Eastern Europe began, when it was baptized 1034 years ago by the Great Prince Volodymyr of Kyiv. The state in which the history of indomitability began, which is now admired by all of Europe and the whole world. This is our state. Our country. This is Ukraine. The history of its state formation dates back thousands of years. But only this year we celebrate the Day of Ukrainian Statehood for the first time. We do not need fireworks and pomp to show the importance of our own statehood for the Ukrainian people. Today we defend it with weapons in hands. For 155 days in a row. We can say that for us, Statehood Day is every day. Every day we fight so that everyone on the planet finally understands: we are not a colony, not an enclave, not a protectorate. Not a gubernia, an eyalet or a crown land, not a part of foreign empires, not a \"part of the land\", not a union republic. Not an autonomy, not a province, but a free, independent, sovereign, indivisible and independent state. It originates at least one and a half thousand years ago. Since the date officially recognized by the UN and UNESCO, when Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv and Lybid founded the capital of Ukraine. It is the only legal heiress of Kyivan Rus’, the possessions and achievements of our rulers. Askold and Dir, Vishchy Oleg, Prince Igor, Equal-to-the-Apostles Princess Olga, Sviatoslav the Brave, Volodymyr the Great, Yaroslav the Wise, Volodymyr Monomakh, King Danylo. It is the heiress of the Cossack State. Homeland of Bayda Vyshnevetsky, Sahaidachny, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Ivan Mazepa, Pylyp Orlyk. It is the legal successor of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Ukrainian State of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi. Independence and unity proclaimed by the universals of the Central Rada and the Unification Act. It has a rich tradition of law-making, writing and diplomacy. \"Rus’ka Pravda\", Annales Bertiniani, Ostromyr Gospels, Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk and hundreds of other sources and documents that contain written references to our state and its recognition by other states and rulers. It has glorious military traditions. It is the homeland of famous warriors, indomitable fighters for their own freedom and statehood. In Rus’, in Sich, on the battlefields of the First and Second World Wars. In Kholodny Yar, in the Carpathian forests, near Kruty. All stages of the history of Ukraine's statehood, its defense and struggle for it can be described in one sentence: we existed, exist and will exist! We will exist, because our state has incredible sons and daughters who have stood up for its defense. The names of Sviatoslav the Brave, King Danylo, Hetmans Sahaidachny, Khmelnytsky, Vyhovsky, Apostol, generals Handziuk and Almazov are written on their war flags and khorugvs. They bear the honorific names of \"Knights of the Winter Campaign\", \"Sich Riflemen\", \"Chorni Zaporozhtsi\" and \"Kholodnoyarivtsi\". They and millions of our other warriors defend Ukraine under the names of their ancestors. With responsibility to them. And we feel their support. The support of all generations of fighters for an independent Ukraine. Our warriors defend Ukraine on the ground, in the water and in the air. Our ancestors defend it from the skies. And all of them together are our angels. Our angels have wings. But under them there are weapons. We never take weapons first. But if our home is attacked, we stand to the last. Because, losing its own state, any nation loses primarily not its territory. Not hectares or square kilometers of land or water. When a nation loses its own state, it loses its own face. Its own name. Its originality, identity, memory, and with them its heart and soul. And this is much scarier for us than enemy armies, planes, missiles and tanks. That is why millions of us are ready to stop them without fear. And defend the most valuable at the cost of one's life. Because having lost what is meaningful to us, we lose the meaning of life itself. Because for us, living in captivity is not living. Being dependent is not being. Because a non-independent and unfree Ukraine is not Ukraine. We do not know the word \"slavery\". It is in our dictionaries, but not in our heads. We will give our last shirt, we will give everything we have for what is in our heart. That is why we will fight for our statehood to the last - the last breath, the last bullet, the last soldier. Not ours, but the enemy's. We will live to fight and fight to live. We will not give up until we drive the last occupier out of our home. We will not stop until we liberate the last meter of Ukrainian land. We will not rest until we liberate our last village, our last house, our last well, our last cherry tree, our last willow tree! It will be so. And it will only be so! Because for us and for the occupier, all this has completely different, polar meanings. Targets for them are shrines for us. Unknown names on the map for them are places familiar from childhood for us. They fulfill other people's criminal orders, we fulfill our sacred duty. We are fighting for different things, so the end of this battle will also be different for both of us. By meaning. And even by the sound. In Russian, this is the failure of a special operation. In Ukrainian, this is victory in the war! That is why it will happen. That is why our state will exist. Congratulations on the Day of Christianization of Kyivan Rus’ - Ukraine! Congratulations on Ukrainian Statehood Day! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, Dear friend Gitanas, Dear Mrs. President Roberta Metsola, Dear deputies, dear government officials, Dear military, And all our citizens of Ukraine! We are citizens of the strongest state in the world. The state that is at war. The state, which at the same time is being reformed. And the state that ensured the most powerful unification of democracies in history. The state, which on the 155th day of Russia's full-scale war against us, has the strength to celebrate its day - the Day of Ukrainian Statehood. We ensured that the values of the free world did not remain mere rhetoric and actually started working to protect civilization. We made the European Union the most united in all the years of its existence, and it is getting stronger thanks to our strength. We ensured that all the tyrants of this world saw the potential of democracy. This was done by us, the citizens of Ukraine. All of us - military and civilians, diplomats and volunteers, civil servants and businesses, politicians, social leaders and media... Each and every one who worked conscientiously at his and her level for the sake of one thing - for the sake of Ukraine, one’s family and our future. We, the citizens of a state, which has over a thousand years of history, did it. Over a thousand years of its culture. Over a thousand years of its character - Ukrainian character, unbreakable one. Which endured on our land under the hits of many invaders... Where have you come, the Russian army blinded by your pathetic ambitions? You’ve come up against us - those who were prepared for this crucial war for independence by dozens and dozens of generations of the Ukrainian people who lived and live here, who fought and fight here, who built and build here and who dreamed and dreams above everything else that there is no someone else’s rule over them and Ukraine. It's time for this dream to become a reality forever. This is our time! We will make this dream come true. We will become not a new legend of heroic resistance, but a state of winners. Not 300 Spartans, worthy of films, books and plays, but the multimillion-strong nation-hero which is worthy of living, worthy of winning and which will teach others in the world how to defend themselves and how to win. We will be remembered not as those who tried, but as those who preserved, strengthened and passed our state to our children so that they could pass it on to their children. A free, strong, modern and efficient state. We will do it - we, citizens of Ukraine. Friend Gitanas Nausėda, dear Mr. President! I want to thank you and - in your person - the entire Lithuanian people today, on the Day of our Statehood, for the significant, important, heroic support that Ukraine received. Thank you! It was not politics for our states - it reflects the equally strong love for freedom of our nations. Nations who walked and keep walking together through European history. Thank you again! Mrs. Roberta, Mrs. President of the European Parliament! I would like to note your bravery. You visited Kyiv at a time when the invaders’ army was threatening our capital, and you were the first among the heads of EU institutions to do so. At that time we saw our character in your bravery, we saw our person - a person who will always defend the values of Europe and will not betray freedom. I am thankful to you! I am thankful to all friends and partners of Ukraine - both from large states and from geographically smaller ones yet whose will is not inferior to the will of the largest. I am grateful to everyone who helps Ukrainians destroy evil! Due to the cruelty of history - after several unfortunate historic turns - our state was not mentioned for some time. Then they’ve been saying that Ukraine is somewhere next to Russia, or is even allegedly a part of it. We know that now they definitely know - Ukraine is the only state in the world that has the bravery to beat Russia. Beat on our land notwithstanding any of its threats. It is important that we make others fall in love with our Ukrainian indomitability. It is important that we are all a state that functions for the sake of Ukrainian interests and is reckoned with by everyone in the world. It is important that we are a democratic state that is strengthening its institutions even now, especially now - during such a devastating war. We applied to join the European Union and were granted candidacy with speed and under conditions unprecedented for any other state. This is our development. These are our friends, their help. These are our interests. This is Ukrainian speed - what we became capable of when we freed ourselves from illusions and achieved the greatest national unity in history. Glory to Ukraine! It is with the same speed that we should come to the beginning of negotiations regarding Ukraine's membership in the European Union. We will do everything we have to for this. We will synchronize the legislation of Ukraine with the law of the European Union. A plan for the implementation of all EU regulations and directives as part of the fulfillment of the Association Agreement with the European Union has also been formed. This is actually a joint task for us, for you, dear deputies, and for the Government of our country. And this corresponds to our new reality. The fact that we have transferred the process of European integration from the sphere of foreign policy to the sphere of domestic policy. This is where real work, real European integration, starts. Ukraine has always been Europe. Our values have always been European. Our state-building experience of different times is a European experience. And now we have come to the point where our state system is institutionally becoming Europe. We have started the process of de-oligarchization - a registry is being formed that is ready to put the oligarchs under the power of society. I have signed a decree on the creation of a competition commission for the selection of candidates for the High Council of Justice, and thanks to this and other steps, we will do everything to ensure that the fundamental judicial reform provides every Ukrainian with access to honest and competent justice. Today, the new Prosecutor General finalized the appointment of the new head of the Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office with his first decision. And it is an honor for me to announce another very important step now. The European Union has the College of Europe in Bruges and Natolin, which are some of the most prestigious institutions of postgraduate education that prepare professionals to work in institutions of the EU and member states. We are establishing our College of Europe in Ukraine. A corresponding memorandum has already been signed between the Government of Ukraine and the College of Europe in Natolin. At the first stage, a faculty of European integration will be established in one of the Ukrainian higher education institutions, and later, on its basis, the College of Europe in the framework of the Presidential University will be established. And although I have been told that this will not be resolved in months, as I have been told many times on other issues, I know that the creation of our College of Europe will not take long. I'm sure it will start working shortly. We already have this experience - to turn into months what was supposed to take years and decades, and into weeks - what was supposed to take months. Such a College will become not only a professional basis for the European policy of Ukraine as a member of the EU, but also our contribution to the development of European institutions. This is what we, the citizens of Ukraine, are capable of. This is our statehood. We showed strength in battles and united the world with the best emotions that people have. We fight against the terror of the occupiers, we defend humanity for all nations. We guarantee that the borders of Europe will never again move further west than our eastern state border. And we make our state and public institutions advanced. And when today, on this Day of Ukrainian Statehood, here, in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, before the eyes of the entire Ukrainian people, I will honor strong people for strong deeds with the Cross of Combat Merit, I want all Ukrainians to feel: we are behind those who defend our country on the battlefield, and behind our backs - the backs of millions of Ukrainians living now - there are those who have been creating Ukrainian history, Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian character for centuries. We must be worthy of the height of our people, all its generations, and the thousand-year weight of our statehood. I congratulate you all on the holiday! I am thankful to our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, we celebrated the Day of Ukrainian Statehood for the first time. And I was happy to see how many people perceived this holiday warmly, congratulated on it, smiled and were proud of Ukraine. It seems that we should have celebrated such a day for many, many years - it is so logical. But this holiday was established only last year. Well, it is forever now. During a solemn meeting in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, I presented combat awards to our warriors - \"Crosses of Combat Merit\". In particular, to Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander of the Khortytsia Operational-Strategic Command, Major-General Andriy Kovalchuk, Brigadier-General Andriy Hnatov, Brigadier-General Mykhailo Drapaty, Colonels Yevhen Bulatsyk, Mykola Mishakin and Oleh Fedoriv, ​​Lieutenant-Colonel Pavlo Rozlach, Majors Ruslan Maryshev and Denys Nokhrin, Captain Dmytro Berehovy, Senior Lieutenants Dmytro Linnyk and Anatoliy Tantsyura, Medical Service Lieutenant Yulia Holovna, Sergeant Pavlina Mykolayevych, Staff Sergeant Roman Palamarchuk, Junior Sergeant Oleksandr Rohachevsky, Senior Sailor Olena Zablotska and Private Serhiy Mishchenko. Thank you all for your service and performance in battles! Today, in the Mariyinsky Palace, I handed out the passports of the citizens of our state to young Ukrainians - boys and girls who were forced to leave their homes due to hostilities, young volunteers, winners of the All-Ukrainian Olympics, children of our warriors who defend Ukraine, children of those who gave life for the independence of the state. An inspiring ceremony that affirms the power of Ukrainian citizenship! The future of Ukraine is in such children, in their sincerity and intelligence. I am proud to be the President of such citizens. I had the honor to thank one of our greatest friends - Mr. President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda for the support and extremely important things that strengthened our defense. President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola - a principled friend of ours in European structures - addressed the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in a special format. There were important phone conversations. In the morning - with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. I thanked him for his prayers for Ukraine, for his wishes of victory and peace. In the evening, I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte - very meaningfully about our future cooperation. I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. We considered four issues. What can be said publicly now: we analyzed the current state of providing weapons to our defenders, the supply of aid from partners and, in general, the state of implementation of the Defense Plan of Ukraine, which was put into effect on February 24. Only in the first half of this day, and only in Kyiv, there were four air alarms. The Russian army launched missile attacks on the Kyiv region, Kropyvnytskyi, hit Mykolaiv, continued a series of strategically senseless and brutal onslaughts on Donbas... I thank each and every one who repels this terror. And I also want to thank the American senators who unanimously approved the resolution calling on the US Department of State to recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. You can take any day in Ukraine - today or any other after February 24 - to see that no one in the world invests in terrorism more than Russia. This really needs a legal response at the global level. And there is no rational reason why such a reaction should not occur, particularly in the United States. We continue to accumulate international humanitarian support. I am glad that Demna, the creative director of the Balenciaga fashion house, has become the new ambassador of the United24 state charity platform. He told me that the decision to become a United24 ambassador was related to his personal story, as he had experienced the trauma of being a refugee. Demna will help Ukraine in the direction of reconstruction. Let me remind you that Andriy Shevchenko, Elina Svitolina, Liev Schreiber and Imagine Dragons have already become ambassadors of United24. We will do everything so that there is no indifference left in the world towards this terrible war that Russia has unleashed against our state and against the very idea of freedom. We will definitely win! Congratulations once again on the Day of Ukrainian Statehood! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainian men and women! Dear all our defenders! I am returning from Odesa region. In particular, today I met with our heroes – soldiers of the Special Operations Forces. I thanked them for their service, awarded the best and emphasized that their main task is to ensure that the enemy did not have a single calm moment on this land. The land must burn under their feet. Every occupier who abuses Ukrainians, who tortures and kills, should know that there will be punishment for this. If some of the Russian killers hope that they will not be brought to justice, that they will hide somewhere, let them know – they will answer in any case. Geography, time, borders, walls will not stop a just retribution. I heard reports today about the attack of the occupiers on Olenivka, Donetsk region. It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war. More than 50 dead... When the defenders of Azovstal left the plant, the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross acted as guarantors of the life and health of our soldiers. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Security Service, the Main Intelligence Directorate and the representative of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine issued a joint statement addressing to the UN and the Red Cross as guarantors of those agreements regarding the defenders of Azovstal. I support this statement. Now the guarantors must react. They must protect the lives of hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war. And I add on my own: there should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. I am especially appealing to the United States of America – a solution is needed, needed now. Russia has proven with numerous terrorist attacks that it is the biggest source of terrorism in the world today. It's a fact. Ukrainian diplomats brought the information about the Russian attack on Olenivka to the highest international level. The UN Security Council has been informed. All participants in international relations will know what really happened. Russia won't be able to lie to anyone. The international community is also informed about all the details of our resistance to Russian hunger terror. Concrete work on the restoration of Ukrainian grain exports began today in Odesa. It's important. It's important not only from the point of view of the economic strength of our state, which is needed to withstand this war. It's important for the world to withstand the pressure of the food crisis. The more Ukrainian grain is on the global market, the more stable the situation with our partners will be, and therefore our joint countermeasures against the terrorist state will be more effective. I emphasize – a terrorist state. I don't want to make any forecast now – let's see how the agreements on grain export will be implemented. The UN, Turkey and other international partners are responsible for the security side of this process. The Armed Forces of Ukraine do everything necessary to protect our coast. I want to say one more thing today. Russian terror is primarily aimed at breaking our inner strength. Russia cannot do anything to us on the battlefield. Our defenders are very strong. You and I should be just as strong. Our emotions, our common will to fight must be strong until our very victory. No matter what the occupiers do, no matter how they try to break our spirit, we must hold on, be mobilized and fully focused on what is necessary for our victory. If any of you feel that you cannot stand the evil that you see, think about how else you can personally help the defense of Ukraine. Help the Armed Forces! Tell the world the facts about Russian terror! And convince everyone you know in partner countries to increase aid to Ukraine. We will definitely win. But we have to come to that. We are all together. Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror! Eternal glory to each and every one who destroys these occupiers! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! During this day, our state received many signals from different countries condemning the Russian terrorist act in Olenivka. The world sees the truth. And I thank all our partners who are ready to join in establishing all the circumstances of this terrible execution of our prisoners. All evidence of this crime committed by the occupiers will be collected. Everyone is guilty – who approved, who organized, who blasted these people, who knew about it – they all will be found. But still, this is not enough now. There must be legal steps on the part of the world community against the terrorist state. Condemnation at the level of political rhetoric is not enough for this mass murder. What relationship can be with the terrorist after that? What kind of business can be done with such a country? Ukrainian diplomats and all friends of Ukraine abroad will increase their activity even more to track and destroy all those connections of the terrorist state with the free world, which Russia still uses. And formal legal recognition of Russia as a terrorist state, in particular, recognition by the United States Department of State, is needed not as a political gesture, but as an effective defense of the free world. This decision will automatically make it difficult for the terrorist state to exist, and will automatically cut various political and business ties that Russia would maintain otherwise. And all this will happen one hundred percent. It will have to be done – it's only a matter of time and the format of making this decision. And the sooner it happens, the less evil Russia will have time to do. It is important to hear exactly the same motivation now for all our people who still remain in Donbas, in the areas of the fiercest fighting. There are hundreds of thousands of people, tens of thousands of children... Many of people refuse to leave... But it really needs to be done. This decision will still have to be made. Anyway! Believe me. And the sooner it is done, the more people leave Donetsk region now, the fewer people the Russian army will have time to kill. Therefore, if you have the opportunity, please talk to those who still remain in the combat zones in Donbas. Please convince them that it is necessary to leave, especially if they are families with children. If you have the opportunity to help displaced people, do it. There is a government decision on mandatory evacuation from Donetsk region, everything is being organized. Full support, full assistance – both logistical and payments. We only need a decision from the people themselves, who have not yet made it for themselves. Go, we will help. We are not Russia. That is why every life is important for us. And we will use all available opportunities to save as many lives as possible and to limit Russian terror as much as possible. At this stage of the war, terror is the main weapon for Russia. And that is why the main task of every Ukrainian, every defender of freedom and humanity in the world is to do everything to isolate the terrorist state and to protect as many people as possible from Russian attacks. I am grateful to everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! To our heroes! Grateful to everyone who saves our people from this Russian terror! We will defeat everyone! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today, one of the most brutal shellings of Mykolaiv and the region over the entire period of the full-scale war took place. Dozens of missiles and rockets... The occupiers hit residential buildings, schools, other social infrastructure, and industrial facilities. The Russian attack took the lives of Oleksiy Vadaturskyi and his wife Raisa, the founder of one of the largest Ukrainian agricultural companies \"Nibulon\", the Hero of Ukraine. My sincere condolences to the relatives and friends of the Vadaturskyi couple. It is exactly such people, such companies, our Ukrainian south that have guaranteed the world's food security. It has always been so. And it will be so again. The Russian terrorists should not even hope that they will be able to destroy the social and industrial potential of Ukraine and walk through the ruins. Ukraine and our people, our capabilities are definitely more powerful than any Russian missiles and shells. Now the Russian army is trying to strengthen its positions in the occupied areas of the south of our country, increasing activity in the relevant areas. Part of the Russian forces from their positions in the east are moved to the south - to the Kherson region and the Zaporizhzhia region... But this will not help them there. None of the Russian strikes goes unanswered by our military and intelligence officers. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are ready to respond to any new activity of the occupiers. And today I want to thank every resident of Mykolaiv for their indomitability, for protecting the city and the region. I also thank Nikopol, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih and the entire Dnipropetrovsk region, the strong people of Zaporizhzhia and the region, all Ukrainians of the Kherson region, everyone who defends the outskirts of Odesa and the region... Thank you for your courage! Strategically, Russia has no chance of winning this war. And it is necessary to hold on, so that even at the tactical levels, the terrorist state feels its defeat. We have to hold on in the south, in the east and everywhere. We have to hold on in defense, diplomacy and politics. To preserve our unity - and not only until the victory, but also after it, in order to qualitatively restore everything destroyed by the occupiers. I believe that we will do all this. I signed several important laws today, in particular the law on providing additional guarantees of protection to media representatives working in the areas of hostilities. This will strengthen the protection of our journalists. The law on ensuring the rights and freedoms of IDPs is eliminating bureaucratic barriers that limited assistance to people. The law on the protection of the civilian population in the event of emergency situations and hostilities. Also, the law that creates conditions for comprehensive thermal modernization of buildings and simplifies the process of restoring the residential sector damaged by the strikes of the occupiers. Important ratification laws, some other acts as well. We are preparing for a new week - as always, full of international activity. Already tomorrow there will be important negotiations with European partners. In a few days I will continue delivering speeches to the international community, communicating with different audiences - it is very important, in particular with the student audience. No matter what happens and no matter what the occupiers’ plans are, we must do our job - protect our state and take care of each other. The more effective we are in this - all of us, all citizens of Ukraine - the faster we will achieve victory. Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! The implementation of the Initiative on the export of Ukrainian grain and other agricultural products from our ports in the Black Sea began today. The first vessel carrying 26,000 tons of corn left the port of Odesa. As of now, it is too early to draw any conclusions and predict further events. But the port started working, the export traffic started, and this can be called the first positive signal that there is a chance to stop the spread of the food crisis in the world. Currently, everything depends on the implementation of the security parameters of the Initiative, which is the responsibility of the partners, primarily the United Nations and Turkey. We cannot have the illusions that Russia will simply refrain from trying to disrupt Ukrainian exports. Russia consistently provoked famine in the countries of Africa and Asia, which traditionally imported large volumes of Ukrainian food. And now - in conditions of extreme heat, as this year in Europe, the threat of a price crisis and a certain food shortage is also possible for some European countries. So, we’ll see how the agreements will work and whether there will really be security. 16 vessels are already waiting their turn for departure, and we are ready to make a proper contribution to the stabilization of the world food market. For our state, this is also of great benefit - and this is not only about billions of dollars in foreign exchange revenue. About half a million Ukrainians are involved in the cultivation of agricultural export crops, and if we add related industries, then this is plus a million jobs. That is why there is the appropriate state attention to the implementation of the export Initiative. Our people really need it. Today I spoke with President of France Emmanuel Macron, in particular about the restoration of our agricultural exports by sea. In general, the negotiations lasted one and a half hours and were very meaningful: relations in the defense sphere, first of all. A wide range of security issues - thank you for the assistance already given to Ukraine, which effectively protects us on the battlefield. We also discussed macro-financial support for our state - I asked Mr. President to help us unblock macro-financial aid, which has stalled in Europe. I want to remind all the leaders that it is 9 billion euros. These are not trifles for us, but important social things - these are our pensions, these are our salaries, support for IDPs, and therefore we expect appropriate decisions from specific government officials. Mr. President of France informed me about the results of his African tour - we are now strengthening this direction of our foreign policy. I invited President Macron to participate in the online summit of the Crimea Platform, which will take place shortly. Last year, we created the Crimea Platform and are developing this format – despite all the threats and tangible diplomatic opposition from Russia. During the years of occupation, Russia turned Crimea into a large military prison camp - and tens of thousands of people became its victims. Crimea became a bridgehead for attacks on the free territory of our country... The weak and insufficiently principled reaction to the occupation of Crimea in 2014 and in the following years became one of the prerequisites for the fact that Russian aggression managed to grow to such a scale. We will gradually restore justice regarding our Crimea. The situation on the battlefield has not undergone significant changes over the past day. Fierce battles continue in Donbas, in the Kharkiv region, the struggle for the south of our country continues... Ukrainian artillery and intelligence have already done a lot to reduce the fire potential of the occupiers - and it is tangible. Today I want to thank all our warriors who destroy Russian logistics, who destroy the occupiers' ammunition and who do not leave the occupiers a single safe place on our land. And I also want to thank our partners now - everyone who supplies Ukraine with modern and effective artillery and MLRS. The power of the democratic world is well felt on the battlefield in Ukraine these weeks. And today, another conversation took place in the format Ukraine - United States - three on three - Andriy Yermak and Jacob Sullivan, Dmytro Kuleba and Antony Blinken, Valerii Zaluzhny and Mark Milley. This is our continuous format, which has already allowed us to make a fundamental contribution to the protection of the entire free world. We’ve coordinated next steps in support of Ukraine. Eternal glory to everyone who fights for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, the first vessel with Ukrainian grain arrived at the Bosphorus, passing through a special corridor in the Black Sea, which was agreed upon to unblock our ports. Our goal now is to have regularity: so that when one ship leaves the port, there are other ships as well - both those loading and those approaching the port. Continuity and regularity is the necessary principle. All consumers of our agricultural products need it. Much has already been said about why it is important to restore Ukrainian agricultural exports. I will add just one detail now. Export this year is needed so that our farmers and agricultural companies have sufficient resources for next year's sowing. This is a matter of food security for our country as well - we are now ensuring next year. Russia provoked the food crisis in order to use the supply of wheat, corn, oil as a weapon... Just as it is already doing with gas and crude oil. Russia creates a deficit, instigates the increase in prices, and when this provokes social unrest, it demands political concessions. It should not work with food. Of course, we understand who we are dealing with. And in Russia, they understand that they are losing one of the opportunities to terrorize the world. But when the world is united, when partners fulfill their commitments, the necessary result can be achieved. Let's see how the grain initiative will work in the coming days. And I want everyone in Ukraine to realize this despite the disinformation campaign about the grain initiative, which is being spread by the enemies of our state... Every hryvnia earned by our agricultural workers and all the restored international ties of Ukraine will contribute to the strengthening of our state. I spoke today with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Of course, the key theme is the defense support of our struggle for freedom, this is an interaction that we must strengthen constantly for our common interests. OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland Zbigniew Rau was in Kyiv today - I thanked him for the support. In negotiations with both Mr. Stoltenberg and Mr. Rau, I paid special attention to the issue of our prisoners of war kept by Russia. In particular, this also applies to the Russian terrorist attack in Olenivka, which must become an ultimate argument for all civilized countries of the world to officially recognize Russia as a terrorist state. What else is needed for this? Isn't this a sufficiently brutal and obvious act of terrorism for the relevant decisions to recognize Russia as a terrorist state to be made in the major capitals of the world? Of course, the occupiers receive a fundamental response to all their crimes on the battlefield. In this context, today I want to thank President of the United States Biden and the entire American people for the new package of defense support for Ukraine. The word \"HIMARS\" has become almost synonymous with the word \"justice\" for our country, and the Ukrainian defense forces will do everything to ensure that the occupiers experience more and more painful losses every week thanks to these very effective systems. Yes, indeed, we still cannot completely break the advantage of the Russian army in artillery and in manpower, and this is very tangible in the battles, especially in Donbas - Pisky, Avdiivka, other directions. It's just hell there. It can't even be described in words... And every Ukrainian must always be grateful to our warriors who defend Ukrainian positions there despite the terrorists' significant fire superiority. But every day our diplomats and all other representatives of our state do everything possible and everything impossible to get the weapons that will ultimately help Ukraine stop this horde and to convince everyone who still has doubts about the supplies. Today I also thank these people - each and every one who ensures the supply of weapons, who promotes the necessary decisions in partner states, who literally lives in these arms negotiations. We also have new decisions to strengthen sanctions against Russia for the war - the United States and Canada have expanded the list of individuals and legal entities against whom restrictions have been applied. This is the right way, and it is necessary for the European Union to fill in the sanctions pause as soon as possible by adopting a new package of sanctions against the terrorist state. We will work on this in the coming weeks. In the evening, I signed decrees awarding our defenders. 167 warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 32 of them posthumously. Another decree awarded 16 intelligence officers, 1 of them posthumously. Also - 122 employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, 2 - posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who fight for independence! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mrs. Rector of the Australian National University! Dear lecturers! Dear students! I know that a total of 20 universities in Australia are currently participating in the broadcast. I am grateful for this opportunity to speak with you. Today is the 161st day of the full-scale war launched by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Every day, the world is shocked by new reports about new Russian crimes. This should not become usual for the world. Because it will mean that the world has come to terms. A lot of people worried and maybe still worry about the fact that it is necessary to act delicately and not to anger Russia. Regarding Russia being able to \"save face\". By now it should be obvious to everyone - all this is of no importance. It is impossible to anger those who are mad. It is impossible to save face for someone who does not want it. The Russian Federation has been openly demonstrating this to all states for 161 days in a row. Now it is important not to forget any of them. The world always talks about Russia's actions only in the context of their latest, so to speak, \"current\" atrocity. Now the world must finally put everything together and realize... He who wants to save face does not erase peaceful cities and villages from the face of the Earth. Does not fire at them with MLRS every day and every night. Does not shoot at residential buildings with cruise missiles. Does not fire cluster munitions or phosphorus bombs at residential areas. Does not fire missiles at the railway station, for example, in the city of Kramatorsk, where hundreds of people were simply waiting for evacuation. Does not fire missiles at Vinnytsia downtown where hundreds of people were just walking. Does not fire missiles at the shopping mall in Kremenchuk, where hundreds of people were buying food or stuff. Does not drop bombs on maternity hospitals and hospitals. Kindergartens, schools and universities. Museums, theaters, churches. Does not direct artillery against cemeteries and does not fire missiles at the memorial complex for the victims of the Holocaust - Babyn Yar. He who wants to save face does not commit thousands of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Does not organize mass executions of civilians. Does not handcuff civilians, does not put them on their knees and does not kill them with a shot in the back of the head. Does not rape women in front of their children and children in front of their mothers. He who wants to save face does not organize blockades of the occupied cities. Does not leave thousands of people without food and drinking water. Does not leave thousands of seriously ill patients without the necessary daily medications. Does not leave people without light, without heating, without connection, without the slightest hope. Does not disrupt humanitarian corridors. Does not take people to forced labor. Does not kidnap children, separating families. Does not leave behind dozens of mass graves. He who wants to save face does not seize nuclear power plants, does not fire at power units with tanks. Does not threaten the world with a nuclear strike and nuclear war. Does not threaten to create an energy crisis. Does not block ports and ships with grain, creating a threat of mass famine on the planet. And after signing the document on the unblocking of ports and free passage of ships, does not fire missiles at the seaport the day after signing! He who wants to save face does not bring mobile crematoria to burn corpses, to conceal his own atrocities and losses. Does not treat his own soldiers like cannon fodder. Does not treat prisoners of war worse than animals, does not torture, does not organize mass executions, atrocities, terrorist attacks. He who has lost his mind, heart, conscience, dignity and, in general, everything human, does not seek to save face. At least because he lost it a long time ago. Today's Russia lost its face a long time ago. It did not happen yesterday, not the day before yesterday, and not last week. This was simply confirmed once again. Once again, the world saw what was hiding under the mask of a supposed peacemaker, which Russia tried to wear for many years. There is another mask. With slits for eyes and mouth. A mask worn by terrorists. And the only difference between terrorists and Russia is that the first take responsibility for their actions, while Russia does not have the courage to do so and has the audacity to blame others for its crimes. Other countries and the whole world. And now this world faces a choice. Long overdue, not convenient for someone, unpleasant, and for someone - inevitable. You can't hide from it, you can't come off unscathed, you can't let it slide. During the 161 days of the full-scale war in Europe, humanity passed 161 points of no return. For many countries, the time has come when their own interests must yield to the interests of the planet. Because otherwise, both the first and the second will be under threat due to the actions of the world terrorist. Any trade, business, other forms of cooperation with Russia today, first of all, bring not probable benefits to some but probable death to others. Political, economic, energy or any other expediency is equal to the lives of thousands of people today. Who are killed by Russian weapons. The world must make a choice. The UN must make a choice. The UN Security Council must make a choice. The International Committee of the Red Cross must make a choice. The OSCE must make a choice. EU countries must make a choice. NATO countries must make a choice. The G7 and G20 countries must make a choice. The US must make a choice and take this important step. Recognize Russia as a sponsor of terrorism. This time has come. Long ago. The global countdown has started. And then there are only 2 options. Determination, and therefore an end to the crimes and atrocities of Russia, or – more bomb explosions from these terrorists. I know that many Australians send financial aid to our country, donate medications, volunteer in hospitals, ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and fight on the frontline. So I urge you to continue helping us, helping Ukraine, including in the classrooms. Defending the truth and debunking the myths that the Russian propaganda machine has so masterfully learned to fabricate. I am extremely grateful to the government of Anthony Albanese, just as to the previous Australian government, for the systematic support of our state. Which includes large-scale military and humanitarian aid, sanctions against Russian and Belarusian legal entities and individuals, abolition of tariffs on Ukrainian goods, provision of coal for our energy industry. Today, your country provides the largest military aid to Ukraine among non-NATO countries. We would appreciate your continued assistance. The war is not over. And today, more than ever, we need the support of all civilized countries, together with which we will definitely stop and defeat evil. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! These days, in our information space and in social networks, there are a lot of reports about conflict situations and threats that exist in other geographies. First - the Balkans, then - Taiwan, now it may be the Caucasus... All these situations seem different, although they are united by one factor, namely: the global security architecture did not work. If it worked, there wouldn't be all these conflicts. And this is actually what Ukraine has been drawing attention to not only for 161 days since the start of the full-scale war, but for years. Since Russia has completely ignored international law, the interests of humanity as such. 2014 became a turning point. Then, in quite obvious situations - with Crimea, with Donbas, with the downed Malaysian Boeing - Russia avoided immediate and tangible responsibility, preserved business and political ties with the world... And now many in global relations believe that they will manage to do so as well. That is why Ukrainians are now doing a very important thing for everyone in the world. Our people united the free world not just around their struggle for freedom, but around understanding how fragile our freedom is. The freedom of every nation in Europe and in other parts of the world. This fragility can only be protected by joint action, and for this to work in the long term, there must be an effective global security architecture that ensures that no state can ever again resort to terror against another state. At the system level, at the level of global institutions, this is exactly what we are currently working for - both the Ukrainian state and all our partners. Today I spoke with the student community of Australia. More than 20 universities, as well as the interest of Australia's leading media, politicians. I called on all our Australian friends to help us in the information war and spread the truth about Ukrainian defense and Russian terror as much as possible. It is necessary to solve an extremely important national task: the Ukrainian point of view should be seen and heard in those parts of the world where Russian propaganda is still very loud. This applies to the Pacific region, the countries of South and East Asia, the Arab world, Africa and Latin America. And that is why information support is needed from all our people and all friends abroad whose voice can be heard. Today I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia who visited Ukraine. I thanked him for starting the visit with the topic of restoring Ukraine. In the Zhytomyr region, in the framework of our Fast Recovery Plan, we will begin the construction of the first kindergarten out of fifteen objects that have been proposed to the Estonian Government for help in the reconstruction of the region. This is extremely important right now - when displaced people are returning home. Estonia is one of those countries that started helping us even before February 24 and whose support has become extremely important. Ukraine will always remember this. Switzerland has today joined the European Union's seventh package of sanctions - and I am grateful for that. When such a country does not remain neutral in the protection of values and human morality, it is a very important signal for the whole world. Now it is felt that Russia has begun to realize the inevitability of being recognized as a terrorist state. After all that the Russian army and allegedly private Russian military companies have done, no other terrorist organization in the world can claim primacy in terror. Russia is definitely number one among terrorists. And this definitely deserves legal consequences, in particular, in the decisions of the United States and other world actors. And precisely because of this, a new propaganda activity started in Moscow. They suddenly decided to define \"Azov\" as terrorists, although when a terrorist state does this, it is obviously absurd. They are activating various emissaries with theses that the terrorist state allegedly wants negotiations... If Russia really wanted the end of the war, it would not accumulate its reserves in the south of Ukraine now and would not create mass graves of murdered innocent people on Ukrainian territory. Well, in general, it is simply disgusting when former leaders of powerful states with European values work for Russia, which is fighting against these values. Therefore, we need to fight, we need to beat terrorists on our land, we need to spread information about Ukrainian interests and achieve success and victories for Ukraine. Each and every one at their own level - both Ukrainians and partners. Terror can be stopped only by a joint indomitable force. I signed a new decree on awarding our warriors. 194 combatants were awarded state awards. 28 of them - posthumously. Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by terrorists! Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today, Russian terrorists once again fired at Toretsk, Donetsk region, hitting public transport stop. Eight people died, three children are among those injured. Residential buildings were damaged by projectile fragments and the blast wave - those are ordinary high-rise buildings. St. Panteleimon Church was also damaged, the priest was wounded. It was a deliberate strike by the occupiers, another act of terror – cynical and calculated. They knew where they were hitting, and they obviously wanted people to get hurt. However, we do not see clear and timely reports from some international organizations  regarding this and thousands of other crimes committed by Russian terrorists. We saw today a completely different report from Amnesty International, which unfortunately tries to amnesty the terrorist state and shift the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim. There cannot be - even hypothetically - any condition under which any Russian attack on Ukraine becomes justified. Aggression against our state is unprovoked, invasive and openly terroristic. And if someone makes a report in which the victim and the aggressor are allegedly the same in something, if some data about the victim is analyzed and what the aggressor was doing at that time is ignored, this cannot be tolerated. Almost 200 religious buildings alone - temples and prayer houses of various denominations - were damaged or destroyed by Russian strikes. Almost 900 medical facilities. Over 2,200 educational institutions. Dozens of universities, hundreds of schools and kindergartens. The occupiers repeatedly deliberately fired artillery and mortars at people queuing for water, at evacuation buses, and repeatedly at public transport stops. The Russian army did not even refrain from striking at the memorials to the victims of the Holocaust, at the cemeteries... At the camp with prisoners of war in Olenivka. And there are no reports about it for some reason. This is immoral selectivity. Anyone who amnesties Russia and who artificially creates such an informational context that some attacks by terrorists are supposedly justified or supposedly understandable, cannot but realize that it helps the terrorists. And if you provide manipulative reports, then you share the responsibility for the death of people with them. Every day we expand the possibilities of our foreign policy - formal and informal. I spoke today with representatives of the African media - from Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Ghana. African countries can be affected very seriously by the destabilization of world markets and global relations provoked by Russia, in particular due to the food crisis. At the same time, in Africa there is a shortage of true information about the Russian war against our country and a surplus of Russian propaganda. We’ll do everything to change this balance. Negotiations with the President of Guinea-Bissau took place for the first time in the history of our bilateral relations. I noted that Ukraine is ready to be a guarantor of food security for African countries. We discussed the support for our state in international organizations. Tomorrow there will be new negotiations with a leader of an African country, and in general, only recently we started proper communication with eight leaders of African states. Every day and in various ways, I remind some leaders of the European Union that Ukrainian pensioners, our displaced persons, our teachers and other people who depend on budget payments cannot be held hostage to their indecision or bureaucracy. 8 billion euros for Ukraine are currently suspended. And such an artificial delay of macro-financial assistance to our state is either a crime or a mistake, and it is difficult to say which is worse in such conditions of a full-scale war. I don't want to name the European country that is slowing it down now. Let's believe that this is still a mistake and that it will be corrected. I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov reported on the current provision of troops with equipment and ammunition. Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny, Head of the Security Service Malyuk, Minister of Internal Affairs Monastyrskyi also delivered reports. We analyzed the situation in the most acute areas of the frontline, in particular in the Donetsk region. Particular attention was paid to the state of implementation of the previous decisions of the Staff, all of them must be implemented by 100%. I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 192 combatants were awarded state awards, six of them posthumously. In total, more than 25,500 of our defenders have already been awarded for bravery and effectiveness in battles since February 24. More than 4 thousand - posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to everyone who fights against Russian terrorists! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Three vessels with grain for export left our ports today – from Odesa and Chornomorsk. Almost 60,000 tonnes of corn are on board, which are expected by consumers in Turkey, the UK, and Ireland. The first new vessel since February 24 is heading to the port of Chornomorsk for loading. The main thing now is the constant increase in exports. Every adequate world player is interested in this. The more our grain will be on the global market, the smaller will be the harvest of political chaos in countries, primarily in Africa and Asia, but not only there. We must remember that this year the demand for imported food in Europe is much higher than expected. European harvests are smaller because of the heat. But the Ukrainian harvest of grain and oilseeds will most likely meet the forecasts – more than 65 million tonnes are expected. Therefore, if the partners do their part of the obligations under the Grain Initiative, the security part, and do not allow new Russian provocations in relation to our exports, then the food crisis, which has been so threatening to the world, can be overcome. But the situation on the energy market, and especially for European consumers, continues to be very dangerous due to Russia's cynical and worked out well gas blackmail. Instead of supplying gas to the territory of Europe in accordance with the contracts, Russia even simply burns it – and this is happening more than one week. Why does it do this? So that prices in Europe rise even more, so that ordinary Europeans suffer even more and so that it will be even more difficult for everyone on the continent to prepare for winter. This is a manifestation of Russia's deliberate anti-European policy, anti-human policy and the effect of the old mistakes of Europeans who did not want to see that Gazprom, Russian gas pipelines bypassing Ukraine are the same weapons for Russia as tanks and artillery, and each of us, each in Europe is a target for them. And we all have to defend ourselves now. Together to prepare for the new heating season. Together to respond to any provocations of Russia in the energy sector. Together to develop sanctions in response to Russian blackmail and terror. Today, the occupiers created another extremely risky situation for everyone in Europe – they fired at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, twice in one day. This is the largest nuclear power plant on our continent. And any shelling of this facility is an open, brazen crime, an act of terror. Russia should bear responsibility for the very fact of creating a threat to the nuclear power plant. And this is not only another argument in favor of recognizing Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. This is an argument in favor of applying tough sanctions against the entire Russian nuclear industry – from Rosatom to all related companies and individuals. This is purely a matter of safety. The one who creates nuclear threats to other nations is definitely not capable of using nuclear technologies safely. Today I held a meeting devoted to the sanctions policy, confiscation of Russian assets. As government officials reported, assets worth UAH 28 billion have already been forcibly seized in Ukraine. This work continues. More than 900 facilities belonging to the Russian state are proposed to be confiscated. And if we evaluate the property package not only of the terrorist state, but also of its residents, then this are 36,000 items for seizure. All this will be sent to compensate for the damages that Russia causes through war and terror. I also heard the results of the work of the group on the development and implementation of the international compensation mechanism and confiscation of Russian assets abroad. All our partners are actively working on this – in Europe, in the United States. Work on bills that will expand the possibilities for the confiscation of Russian assets for Ukraine is underway. And Donbas burned out by Russian strikes, the abuse of the occupiers over Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, the shelling of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region, Kyiv region, Zhytomyr region, Odesa region and other regions of Ukraine are what Russia will surely pay for: both politically and financially, and with its own future, which Russia is losing with every strike on our territory. I spoke today with the President of Malawi. It is another African state, the ninth country, which Ukraine is in contact with for the first time at the highest level in the entire history of our independence. I assured Mr. President that Ukraine will make every effort so that every country interested in our agricultural products can meet its consumption needs. We also discussed other issues of stability and our cooperation in international organizations. I also signed a decree awarding our soldiers. A total of 192 combatants were given state awards, 18 of them, unfortunately, posthumously. Eternal gratitude to all who is fighting for our great state! Thank you, great people of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I will brief you on the past week. First of all, I want to thank all our soldiers, who are extremely bravely - and in the hottest points of the frontline, with simply superhuman efforts – holding back the enemy. The Russian army will not change its tactics. The occupiers know that they will lose to the Ukrainians in direct struggle, they are inferior in skill, and that is why the enemy is counting on artillery and indiscriminate shelling. They try to destroy everything in front of them and enter the ruins. And I am grateful to everyone who, even in such conditions, still is containing the occupiers in Donbas, in Kharkiv region, in the Mykolaiv direction – wherever the confrontation is the most acute. During this week, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and our intelligence have achieved powerful results in destroying the logistics of the Russian army, the rear bases of the occupiers. And every strike on the enemy's ammunition depots, on their command posts, on accumulations of Russian equipment saves the lives of all of us, the lives of Ukrainian military and civilians. Of course, I thank the partners – everyone who supplies Ukraine with the necessary weapons. In particular, another package of support from the United States was approved this week, which also includes ammunition for the HIMARS systems. Thank you very much. All of them are used as accurately and beneficially as possible for the overall strategy of our defense. We are doing everything to get yet more effective and modern weapons. It was possible to restore the sea export of Ukrainian agricultural products. Our ports on the Black Sea are operating again. And although it is still too early to give general assessments of the process, we can still say that it is positive both for our state and for all our partners. However, the key security risk has not yet been removed. The threat of Russian provocations and terrorist attacks remains. Everyone should be aware of this. But if the partners fulfill their part of the commitment and guarantee the security of the supply, it will really solve the global food crisis. And we must not forget that the restoration of our sea exports was made possible primarily thanks to our soldiers – all those who defend Odesa and secured the liberation of Snake Island. These are simply heroes. During the week, opportunities for Ukraine in the African direction were significantly expanded. There were new contacts with state leaders and communication with journalists. I will continue this work next week – another series of negotiations is planned. Unfortunately, we have a significant worsening of the situation around the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Russian terrorists became the first in the world to use a nuclear plant for terror. The biggest in Europe! We will draw the world's attention to this and insist on new sanctions against Russia for creating such a global threat. And despite the fact that the Russian shelling of the nuclear plant is one of the most dangerous crimes against Ukrainians and all Europeans, against the right to life of every person, for some reason there is no report or even a simple notification from Amnesty International about it. A very eloquent silence, which once again indicates the manipulative selectivity of this organization. This week there are new sanction steps from Canada and the United States. Switzerland made an important decision regarding support for the seventh EU sanctions package. The general tendency to strengthen sanctions remains unchanged and will continue increasing the price for this terror, terror against our people, for the terrorist state. I want to thank everyone who develops our UNITED24 public charity platform, and all the ambassadors of this platform – Andriy Shevchenko, Elina Svitolinia, Liev Schreiber, the band Imagine Dragons, Demna. This week we summed up the three-month results of work the UNITED24 platform. More than UAH 6 billion were raised in contributions for reconstruction, equipment for hospitals, for the purchase of ambulances – dozens of ambulances were purchased. There is already the first helicopter bought using the funds raised by UNITED24. It will be used to rescue the wounded. It was possible to attract help from more than a hundred countries. One of the most important areas for August and September is the implementation of our Fast Recovery Plan. What needs to be done in the territory liberated from the enemy to give people conditions for a normal life and to prepare for the autumn and winter season. In total, 1,060 settlements have already been liberated, and the absolute majority of them require significant restoration work, demining, and the construction of social facilities. And I thank all our partners who joined the relevant work. In particular, this week the delegation of Estonia visited the districts of Zhytomyr region, which the country is helping with recovery. Estonia was the first within the Fast Recovery Plan to choose objects for financing. We work with diplomats and companies in all other areas that need support and restoration. We believe in our defenders! We help the defense! Let's remain united and do everything for the victory of Ukraine! It will be! Eternal glory to our soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is the Day of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and now I want to once again congratulate all military pilots and also all defenders of our skies on a professional holiday. We are all proud of you and wish you so many victories that the Russian soldiers are simply afraid of even the very thought of our Ukrainian sky. This morning, I congratulated the fighters and commanders of the Air Force, handed out state awards to the best warriors. I handed over the \"Golden Star\" orders to the wives of the fallen Heroes of Ukraine - Lieutenant colonel Eduard Vahorovsky and Major Dmytro Kolomiyets. They gave their lives saving their brothers and protecting our state. Eternal memory and gratitude to the Heroes! I spoke today with President of the European Council Charles Michel. I informed him about the situation on the battlefield, about the threat that Russia created by striking at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. There is no such nation in the world that can feel safe when a terrorist state fires at a nuclear plant. God forbid, if something irreparable happens, no one will stop the wind that will spread the radioactive contamination. Therefore, a principled response of the international community to these Russian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia NPP - the largest in Europe - is needed right now. The situation in Donbas remains very difficult. Our army is doing everything possible to stop the Russian terror and inflict the greatest possible losses on the occupiers. Avdiivka, Pisky, Maryinka, Bakhmut and other hot areas in the Donetsk region take the main efforts and, unfortunately, many lives. It is also difficult in the Kharkiv region, in the south of our country, where the occupiers are trying to concentrate their forces. The key thing now, just as before, is weapons for our defense, weapons from partners. Every day without any pauses, we work to increase the supply of weapons, to send more powerful and long-range systems to the front. And next week we expect news from partners regarding support packages. Good news. In this summer time, every week there are more and more reports that the occupiers are preparing for pseudo-referendums in the occupied areas of the south of our country. I want to say a very simple thing: everyone who helps the occupiers in any way realize their intention will be held accountable. They will bear responsibility to Ukraine. The position of our state remains the same: we will not give up anything of ours, and if the occupiers follow the path of these pseudo-referendums, they will close for themselves any possibility of negotiations with Ukraine and the free world, which the Russian side will definitely need in a certain moment. Next week, I will continue the practice of political appeals to representatives of partner states and nations who defend freedom together with us. A number of important negotiations are also planned - and not only with current politicians. As before, Ukraine will do everything to make our struggle and Ukrainian needs known in all countries of the world and in all audiences - even those who usually do not follow political life. In particular, American actress Jessica Chastain arrived in Kyiv today. She visited \"Okhmatdyt\" and saw with her own eyes the consequences of the Russian occupation in Irpin, Kyiv region. Her story about our war will definitely be heard. We are preparing an important humanitarian event. And I am grateful to all friends of Ukraine abroad and to everyone who helps expand our ties in the world. We are doing everything to win, everything to protect our country. I wish all of us Ukrainians a fruitful new week! Glory to our warriors! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! These days, people remember the Russian war against Georgia in 2008. There are many talks about the prerequisites of that war, about its consequences. About how that year's refusal to provide Ukraine and Georgia with a NATO Membership Action Plan increased the audacity of the Russian leadership. But still, the war of that time has not yet become history, has not completely receded into the past. Therefore, it is necessary to talk more about what can be done than about what happened. The challenges of that time are still very relevant today. And not only because the threat of further Russian aggression in this part of the Caucasus still exists, even though it is frozen. Only now has the world begun to realize the need for real, effective tools to prevent such aggressions and to bring any aggressors to justice. 2008, 2014, 2022 - the wars that started in these years have a different scale and nature, but there is one meaning of what happened: regional and global security mechanisms did not work. That is why the principle of prevention, which we have been insisting on for a very long time even before February 24, is so necessary in international relations. If it is already clear that a state is preparing aggression - unjust, unprovoked, illegal, then the world's reaction to its preparation should be the same as to the aggression that happened. It is necessary to act to prevent war, not to wait for strikes and victims. After this Russian war against Ukraine, neither smoldering nor frozen conflict should remain. This is an important conclusion. Ukraine must return everything that Russia temporarily seized, and the aggressor state must be punished for the crime of aggression. And this is important not only for justice. Only the obvious defeat of the aggressor, their loss of everything captured and their international legal responsibility for aggression are safeguards against any war. This is what our diplomats, the Office, government officials and absolutely everyone involved in organizing a global political, economic and legal response to Russian aggression are working on. By protecting our state, we automatically protect everyone who has already been threatened or may still be threatened by a terrorist state. And, of course, the greatest contribution is now made by the military - all Ukrainian heroes who are breaking the Russian terrorist machine on the battlefield. Today I especially want to thank the Ukrainian anti-aircraft fighters of the Air Command \"Center\" and Air Command \"South\" for the successful destruction of Russian missiles that were launched from the Black Sea in the morning. The four downed Kalibrs are dozens of Ukrainian lives saved. Our military also managed to shoot down some of the missiles that Russian terrorists launched at Ukraine in the afternoon and in the evening. Yes, our military means are still not enough to guarantee the downing of all Russian missiles. And we will do everything to ensure that such means appear in our country. But even now, the skill of our heroes makes it possible, at least partially, to reduce the Russian terrorist threat. I am grateful to everyone who ensures that! We are actively informing the world about Russian nuclear blackmail - about shelling and mining of the Zaporizhzhia NPP facilities. There are already appropriate reactions from the international community. But it is necessary to speed up actions in response. Russia will not pay attention to words and concerns. New sanctions are needed against the terrorist state and the entire Russian nuclear industry for creating the threat of a nuclear disaster. The world should not forget about Chornobyl and remember that the Zaporizhzhia NPP is the largest in Europe. The Chornobyl disaster is an explosion in one reactor, the Zaporizhzhia NPP is six power units. I held negotiations with the President of Botswana - the first in the history of our bilateral relations. We discussed cooperation within the UN and other international organizations. I expressed gratitude for the condemnation of Russian aggression and assured Mr. President that Ukraine is ready to continue being the guarantor of world food security. Implementation of the grain export initiative continues - today, for the first time since February 24, a loaded ship left the Pivdennyi port. Currently, there is every chance to ensure the rhythmic nature of such exports. However, as in previous days, the key thing is the ability of the partners to prevent any attempts by Russia to disrupt exports and exacerbate the global food crisis again. And I want to remind all our agrarians, all workers of our ports, all those involved in related industries and all those who comment on this that sea export was restored primarily thanks to our warriors who protected the relevant water area: our intelligence, our special operations forces and \"Alpha\" of the Security Service of Ukraine, gunners, the Navy, the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, border guards and our entire heroic army that defends the state. A new package of American support for Ukraine in the amount of one billion dollars was announced today. These are, in particular, rockets for HIMARS, ammunition for artillery and many other really useful things. I am grateful to President Biden and the people of the United States for this support, 100% of which is used to protect freedom, our common freedom. I signed a new decree on awarding combatants. 183 of our defenders were awarded state awards, four of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Gratitude to everyone who fights for the country! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, there is a lot of attention to the topic of Crimea. And rightly so. Because Crimea is Ukrainian, and we will never give it up. We will not forget that the Russian war against Ukraine began with the occupation of Crimea. Russia has turned our peninsula, which has always been and will be one of the best places in Europe, into one of the most dangerous places in Europe. Russia brought large-scale repression, environmental problems, economic hopelessness and war to Crimea. War. Perhaps historians will one day determine how many people were killed as a result of Russia's use of Crimea for terror. Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands? From Ukraine and Georgia to Syria and more remote regions. The presence of Russian occupiers in Crimea is a threat to the entire Europe and to global stability. The Black Sea region cannot be safe as long as Crimea is occupied. There will be no stable and lasting peace in many countries on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea as long as Russia is able to use our peninsula as its military base. This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea - with its liberation. Today it is impossible to say when this will happen. But we are constantly adding the necessary components to the formula of liberation of Crimea. We launched the Crimea Platform - a key diplomatic platform for the work on the liberation of Crimea. The Crimea Platform will work this year as well. We are already preparing for this summit. The Crimean topic sounds on all international platforms where the Russian war against our state is discussed. The history of the global response to Russia's seizure of Crimea, or rather the lack of such a response, is now one of the best arguments for strengthening sanctions against Russia. The world is beginning to recognize that it made a mistake in 2014 when it decided not to respond with full force to Russia's first aggressive steps. And, of course, we pay due attention to the struggle for rights and historical justice for the indigenous peoples of Ukraine - the Crimean Tatar people, Karaites and Krymchaks. Today, on the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples, we really have something to say. Last summer, the fundamental law on indigenous peoples of Ukraine was adopted. This law recognizes the rights of indigenous peoples and representative bodies of indigenous peoples. Ukraine is a multinational state. Various national communities have been living on our land for centuries. But most of them have experience of state formation outside of Ukraine. Our state is native to peoples whose national cultures and aspirations were formed in Crimea. Therefore, when we are working for the liberation of the peninsula, we are fighting for the restoration of the territorial integrity of our state and for the return of home to the indigenous peoples of Ukraine. I believe that it will be so. I know that we will return to the Ukrainian Crimea. And I am grateful to all our partners and international organizations that help us in this. It is too early to disclose all the details, but this year the work of the Crimea Platform will be no less important and representative than last year, when its first summit was held in Kyiv. The format will be different, but the value will be even greater. We are preparing new solutions for the protection and assistance in the realization of the rights of the indigenous peoples of Ukraine. We are also preparing programs for the economic recovery of our Crimea after its liberation from the occupiers. Well, the main thing is to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and everyone who is fighting to liberate our land and repel the Russian colonial invasion. From the Kharkiv region to Kherson, from Donetsk to Enerhodar, from Stanytsia Luhanska to Yalta, from Berdyansk to Novofedorivka - these are all parts of our country, this is Ukraine, which will be completely free. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our defenders. 182 combatants were awarded state awards. The total number of awarded Ukrainian warriors has already exceeded 26,000 since February 24. I thank everyone who defends Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who fight for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! At the end of this difficult 168th day of our defense, a few things should be said. First. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and our law enforcement agencies will not leave today's Russian shelling of the Dnipropetrovsk region unanswered. 13 people died as a result of the occupiers' attack on Marhanets'. More than ten are wounded, five are in grave condition. Russian troops were striking with \"Grads\". This regular manifestation of Russian terror, just as the attacks on Mykolaiv and Kharkiv, once again proves that it is necessary to increase military aid to Ukraine. The more powerful our weapons are and the greater the range of their use is, the sooner this cruel war will end. And that's the second thing I wanted to say today. This is a question that worries absolutely everyone: when will the war end? Someone says - months, someone - a year, someone - even more. But the question of time actually directly depends on the question of the losses that Russia will suffer. The more losses the occupiers suffer, the sooner we will be able to liberate our land and guarantee Ukraine's security. This is what everyone who defends our state and helps Ukraine should think about: how to inflict the greatest possible losses on the occupiers so that the time of the war gets shorter. If almost 43,000 dead Russian soldiers do not convince the Russian leadership that they need to find a way out of the war, then more fighting is needed, more results are needed to convince. In just one day, the occupiers lost ten combat aircraft: nine in Crimea and one more in the direction of Zaporizhzhia. The occupiers also suffer new losses of armored vehicles, warehouses with ammunition, logistics routes... A conference at the level of defense ministers of Ukraine's partner states begins tomorrow in Copenhagen. Further support for our state in this war, including weapons, will be discussed. I am grateful to all our partners who understand that only by ensuring Russia's defeat on the battlefield, only by Russian losses - military, political, economic - can the return of security for Ukraine and the whole of Europe be brought closer. The more weapons, the more military-technical and financial support Ukraine receives, the sooner our people and all Europeans will be able to experience peace and stability in life again. And the third thing. I want to say it right now to the residents of the temporarily occupied territory. No matter what the occupiers promise, their only way is to escape. At best. If they make it in time. We expelled the Russian army from the northern regions. We expelled the invaders from our Zmiinyi Island. They already feel that the time has come to flee from Kherson and from the south of our country in general. The time will come when they will flee from the Kharkiv region, from Donbas, from Crimea... And everyone who can help in this, should do so. If you have any important information about the enemy, please report it in a safe way to our intelligence services, our military. If you know those who help the occupiers or justify aggression, please report this as well. Be sure to help our people in the occupied territory who are left alone or without communication. Talk to them, support them, tell them about our struggle and about the possibilities of evacuating to a free territory. The invaders are using our people to cover their attacks as human shields. Ukraine will return everything of its own, and must save as many lives as possible. I held several important meetings today, in particular, regarding the program for the fast recovery of liberated territories. I continue to establish new ties at the highest level with African countries - today I spoke with the President of the Republic of Ghana. Yesterday - with the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Food security, cooperation in international organizations, economic ties are a range of issues that benefit both our state and African countries. In the evening, I signed another decree awarding our defenders. 244 combatants were awarded state awards, 21 of them posthumously. Ukrainians should always remember that every step of our army in this war was made in cruel and difficult battles. The occupiers have not captured anything without the resistance of our heroes since February 24 and will not be able to keep anything. We will liberate everything. Eternal glory to everyone who fights for our country! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Prime Minister Frederiksen! Dear Minister Bødskov! Dear attendees, dear participants of the Conference! I am grateful for the organization of such an important event, which is urgently needed now - and not only for Ukraine. To begin with, I would like to remind you of one episode of our shared history. It happened in Sweden. About 700 kilometers from Copenhagen, just over an hour by plane. One day at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, radiation monitoring devices showed the presence of radiation contamination. Then everything was quickly checked and no sources of radiation were found in Forsmark. However, reports began to arrive from other sites in Sweden, as well as from Finland, that there was also an increased level of radiation. Concerns were also raised in Denmark - an increase in the level of radioactive substances was also recorded there. It became clear that an emergency had occurred, but at that time they did not know exactly where. They analyzed the nature of the pollution, the direction and velocity of the wind - and found out that somewhere in the territory from Minsk to the Black Sea, a disaster occurred. It was April 1986 - a day after the explosion of the nuclear reactor in Chornobyl. The Soviet authorities were silent about what happened at that time. And tried to downplay the scale of the disaster. However, it was impossible to hide it - there has already been publicity in Europe, there has already been evidence of pollution, and a discussion has already begun about how it threatens all people. I will not remind you now of all the details of those days. You all probably know about it. About the fire at the Chornobyl station and the efforts of those who tried to stop the unfolding of the disaster. About the diagnosis of \"acute radiation syndrome\" and about people who begged for salvation in terrible death agonies. Significant areas were contaminated. There is still an Exclusion Zone around Chornobyl, where people are not allowed to live. Hundreds of thousands of residents of different countries were affected by Chornobyl in one way or another. And for years after that disaster, the whole world has been thinking about how to make nuclear energy secure. For years, adherence to special standards has been monitored to ensure that such disasters do not occur. And for years absolutely no one could imagine that Europe could be threatened with a new disaster at a nuclear plant not because someone would violate some safety standards, but because some state would deliberately use a nuclear plant for terror. This is what Russia is doing now. And if the Soviet authorities tried to conceal the Chornobyl disaster and its full consequences, the Russian authorities are much more cynical and dangerous - they themselves do everything to maximize the risk of a nuclear disaster, and lie to the whole world that someone else is allegedly to blame. We must protect Europe from this threat. Protect all together. And probably not only Europe. Because the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is the largest on our continent. It is the third largest in the world. Six power units! During the years of operation of this station, there was not a single incident that would endanger the safety of Ukrainians or all Europeans. But now the Russian occupation army is using the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant for terror and armed provocations. Russia has turned the nuclear plant into a battlefield. When the occupiers came to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, their tanks fired at it. Direct fire at the plant! Placing military equipment on the territory of the plant and even disposing of ammunition there, the Russian troops surely know that they are putting the whole of Europe at risk of a nuclear disaster. And of course, the Russian authorities are aware of the possible consequences when their troops fire at a nuclear plant. In particular, from MLRS. In August, it was already now, they damaged the plant's communication lines with our power system, as well as radiation monitoring sensors, nitrogen-oxygen station, hydrogen pipelines and related infrastructure. Already then, Europe was a few steps away from a nuclear disaster. And now we are all in this difficult situation. We are convinced that it is not a coincidence that the trajectory of the cruise missiles which Russia fires at the territory of Ukraine passes over the Ukrainian nuclear power plants. All these are manifestations of Russian nuclear terrorism. Russia has become a terrorist state, and is actually holding nuclear plants hostage, and is blackmailing everyone with a probable disaster. I am sure each of you has already thought about how to act if Russia uses so-called tactical nuclear weapons. Think about this as well. Russia can cause the largest radiation accident in history at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. In terms of actual consequences, it could be even more catastrophic than Chornobyl, and in fact - the same as the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, but without a nuclear strike. None of us can stop the wind if it carries radiation. But together we are capable of stopping a terrorist state. And the sooner we stop Russia, the sooner Europe and the world will be able to feel safe again. Everything that is necessary for this is well known to you. Sanctions against Russia must be strengthened and not allowed to be circumvented. In response to nuclear blackmail, tough sanctions are needed against Rosatom, this is a specific thing, and the entire Russian nuclear industry, not an agreement with them. Constant political pressure on Russia is needed to increase the number of countries participating in the anti-war coalition, and to reduce the circle of those who are at least somehow willing to help Russia in these circumstances. And most importantly, we need even greater support for Ukraine with weapons and ammunition. To really stop Russia, the Armed Forces of Ukraine must have as many shells as necessary to make it tangible that Russia is not able to put pressure on the battlefield. And Ukraine needs weapons of such power, such a long range that Russia is forced to finally think about finding a peaceful solution. Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov who is present among you at the Conference will definitely inform you about specific defense needs. The second point is finances. Russia still receives tens of billions of dollars due to trade with other countries, and Europe in particular. And in Ukraine, the monthly deficit of the state budget alone is about five billion dollars. And the destruction caused by the war is happening on the territory of Ukraine. And we cannot wait until the war is over to restore normal life. Our children have to go to school just like yours. Our youth, just like yours, have to study at universities. Hospitals and social infrastructure have to work in Ukraine just like yours. Therefore, Ukraine needs reconstruction. Now! Just now! And even more so on the eve of the winter season. We need to carry out demining. And, of course, we need to prepare the defense for winter conditions. Therefore, sufficient and timely financial support for our state, for the budget and for the Fast Recovery is as vital as weapons and ammunition for our army, and sanctions against Russia. And the state that blocks this financing for Ukraine cannot have excuses. It should remember that it is a European country and should fix this problem immediately. And the third point is the export to Russia, the supply of components and dual-use products to the companies of the terrorist state. Russia simply would not have a combat-ready army in modern conditions if it was not for imported parts. Electronics, optics and many other parts of foreign production are used in manufacturing missiles, drones, means of communication, armored vehicles, etc. This flow of technical assistance to Russian terror must be completely stopped! There must be an effective mechanism to control any supply to Russia, so as not to miss a single detail that could go to the production of weapons for shelling peaceful cities or nuclear plants. Ladies and Gentlemen! The response now needs to be full-scale, just like the war that Russia started. No one needs new disasters. It is necessary to draw conclusions from the disaster of 1986. From the decades that Russia used to prepare for this vile war against all of free Europe. From eight years of war in Donbas. And from one hundred and seventy days of terror against Ukraine after February 24. No silence - only the truth. No delay - only decisive action. No confusion - only confident, bold unity. We need maximum weapons and ammunition for our defense. Finances are needed for Ukraine in sufficient volume and without any bureaucratic blockages. Complete isolation of the terrorist state, primarily economic, technological,  and the toughest sanctions are required. It is our duty to our nations, to all future generations of free people, to do everything we can to stop Russia, to ensure that it loses this war and that no other state can repeat this terror. And I believe that we will fulfill our duty! Thank you for your attention! I am grateful to Denmark and Great Britain for jointly organizing this Conference, which could become historic. Due to our joint efforts. Thank you again! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Brief summaries of the day. I took part in the donor conference in Copenhagen. These are 26 partner states of Ukraine: European countries, the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand. They established another format - as a continuation of the well-known meetings at the Ramstein Air Base. This format is about long-term support, including weapons, ammunition, military training, demining, recovery of the liberated territory. We already have the first results of the conference. Immediately after the opening of the meeting, Denmark announced a new support package for Ukraine in the amount of 110 million euros. In general, the conference collected 1.5 billion euros in just one day, which will be spent, in particular, on the production of vital ammunition. By the way, this is a significant plus to those credit guarantees for 4 billion dollars that were previously provided by the United States to strengthen our defense cooperation with partners on the supplies for the Ukrainian army. I am thankful to everyone who supported Ukraine today in Copenhagen, and I believe that this format of cooperation will accelerate our joint victory. In my address to the conference participants, I emphasized that everyone needs to act much faster and tougher. And especially after Russia resorted to unconcealed nuclear blackmail. What is happening now around the Zaporizhzhia NPP is one of the biggest crimes of the terrorist state. Today, another shelling by Russia was recorded on the territory of the plant, in the immediate vicinity of the NPP facilities. Russia has once again gone through another floor in the world history of terrorism. No one else has used a nuclear plant so obviously to threaten the whole world and to put forward some conditions. And absolutely everyone in the world should react immediately to expel the occupiers from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. This is a global interest, not just a Ukrainian need. We emphasize this at all levels - from the UN Security Council to contacts between states. Only the complete withdrawal of Russians from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and the restoration of Ukraine's full control over the situation around the plant will guarantee the restoration of nuclear safety for all of Europe. Today I would like to point out an important thing for all representatives of the state and local authorities, the military sphere and other persons who comment on the events at the front, the defense plan of the command, the preparation of specific operations, etc. The general rule is simple: war is definitely not the time for vanity and loud statements. The less concrete details you give about our defense plans, the better it will be for the implementation of those defense plans. If you want to leave the big headlines, that's one thing. Frankly irresponsible. If you want victory for Ukraine, then that is another thing, and you should feel your responsibility for every word you say about our state’s preparation for defense or counteroffensive. Another conversation took place in the permanent format \"Yermak, Sullivan, Zaluzhny, Milley\". The topic of the conversation is clear. The content is positive. And the details, I think, are superfluous. I met today with chef Jose Andres, the founder of World Central Kitchen international humanitarian organization. For more than ten years, he has been feeding people in countries that have become victims of war or natural disasters. A successful restaurateur, working in America, one of the most famous and influential people in the world. From the first days of Russia's full-scale war against our country, his organization started working on the border with Poland - for migrants. Subsequently, it started activities in many cities of Ukraine - already 5 thousand people work there. More than 130 million meals have been cooked for our citizens. We agreed with Mr. Andres on the expansion of such a humanitarian mission, in particular to areas that are gradually being liberated from Russian occupation. And today I also want to thank all Ukrainians and citizens of the friendly states who help meet the humanitarian needs created by this war. Those who help displaced people with housing and jobs. Those who treat and rehabilitate those wounded by Russian shelling. Those who deliver medicine, food and means of communication to the frontline areas. Those who support lonely people and orphans of this war. And those who help restore everything that was destroyed by Russian terrorists. This is a multi-thousand-strong humanitarian army of Ukraine and the entire free world, to which Russia cannot and will not be able to oppose anything. I thank you! Tomorrow will be a busy day - there will be many international and domestic events tomorrow. We are already preparing for them. We do everything to ensure that our defenders have reliable support at the political, diplomatic, economic, humanitarian and all other levels. Eternal glory to all our warriors! Glory to each and every one who defends Donbas, the Kharkiv region, the south, the center and our entire state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today, for the first time, Ukraine celebrates the International Youth Day simultaneously with most of the world's countries. This decision was made last summer – to postpone its celebration to August 12 to be together with Europe in such a symbolic event. And it worked. Youth Day felt very organic today. And above all, together with the First Lady, we met with young heroes-saviors - you are great, I am proud of children and teenagers who are strong despite their age, responsible despite their age. They raise funds for the army, they help our wounded, they help people, they help save people's lives. A special awarding ceremony for such our young heroes was held in the Mariinsky Palace, in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine. Maksym Brovchenko, Irynka Vasylieva, Oleksandr Hutsal, Yehor Shemet, Davyd Ponuliak, Hlib Bondarenko, Andriy Pokrasa, Danylo Serheev. They are from seven to sixteen years old, and they are heroes. And one can be proud of their deeds in such a way that not every adult has such a biography. I also met today with representatives of various youth communities and organizations – educational, volunteer, military, creative, Plast, with representatives of youth from the diaspora... I am very proud that Maryna Viazovska, one of the most famous young Ukrainian women, who received the highest award in the world of mathematics – the famous Fields Medal, also attended the meeting. We had a very warm and fruitful conversation about the defense of our country, about victory – and it is on the horizon, about the future of Ukraine, about our institutions. The ideas sounded very good – we will implement them. I had a talk with the pontiff today. I thanked Pope Francis for the support of Ukrainians. We discussed what we can do together to restore peace in the state. I briefed him on the situation on the front line and Russia's constant efforts to increase the level of terror. He agrees with it, he supports us. The day before, a decision was made in Latvia – Latvia officially recognized Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. We are working to ensure that the whole world does the same. That's fair. It is right. And it will be. After all that the occupiers have done in Ukraine, there can be only one attitude towards Russia - as towards a terrorist state. And, by the way, it is from this point of view that the attitude towards the citizens of Russia should be determined. I thank the Czech Republic, the Baltic states and other countries that brought the issue of visas for citizens of a terrorist state to the official level of discussion in Europe. Of course, we all understand: there are people who really need protection, who are persecuted in Russia, may even be killed, and therefore they should receive help from the civilized world. These are well-known legal mechanisms – through refugee status, asylum requests, and other opportunities to help and support. But it is for those who fight, for those who are persecuted. And this should not apply to the rest of Russian citizens in Europe, tourism, entertainment, business affairs. It is impossible to work for a terrorist state... First, there must be a guarantee that Russian murderers and facilitators of state terror will not use Schengen. And secondly, one cannot destroy the very idea of Europe, our common European values, that is, one cannot turn Europe into a supermarket where it does not matter who enters – the main thing is that a person simply pays for the goods. Therefore, visa restrictions for citizens of the Russian Federation are fair, and all defenders of European values should insist on them. In the evening, I signed a decree awarding our soldiers and heroes. A total of 181 combatants were given state awards, 33 of them posthumously. In total, more than 26,500 Ukrainian men and women were awarded during the war. I am grateful to everyone who defends our country! Who deters very brutal attacks of the occupiers in Pisky, in Avdiyivka, in the Bakhmut area... Who defends Kharkiv region and our south, our dear Ukraine. We will do everything so that each occupier, as well as the terrorist state in general, will fully feel what a strong Ukrainian response to their terror is. Glory to all our soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! And today I would like to address the residents of Nikopol, Marhanets, Enerhodar, Kryvy Rih, Zaporizhzhia and all our other cities and communities of Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. The occupiers are trying to intimidate people in an extremely cynical way, using the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. They actually hide behind the plant to fire at Nikopol and Marhanets. They arrange constant provocations with shelling of the territory of the nuclear power plant and try to bring their additional forces in this direction to blackmail our state and the entire free world even more. If someone over there in Russia thinks that it can give them something, then they are wrong. Russian blackmail only mobilizes even more global efforts to confront terror. Every day of the stay of the Russian contingent on the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and in the neighboring regions of our country increases the radiation threat to Europe so much that even at the peak moments of the confrontation during the Cold War, this did not happen. Of course, there should be a robust response to this. Ukrainian diplomats and representatives of partner states will do everything to ensure that the new sanctions against Russia necessarily block the Russian nuclear industry. And absolutely all officials of the terrorist state, as well as those who help them in this blackmail operation with the nuclear power plant, must be tried by an international court. It will definitely be. And every Russian soldier who either shoots at the plant, or shoots under the cover of the plant, must understand that he is becoming a special target for our intelligence, for our secret service, for our army. I am especially grateful to everyone who defends this direction, who withstands the pressure of Russian terrorists and protects Ukraine and the world from the nuclear threat created by the occupiers. I am grateful to all our energy workers who support the stable operation of the energy system of Ukraine and the Zaporizhzhia plant itself. And we are doing everything possible to restore peace and security to this part of our state, and to all other cities and other regions of our beautiful Ukraine. Fierce fighting continues in Donbas. The hottest points of the front in this direction remain unchanged – Avdiyivka, Maryinka, Pisky, Bakhmut and the entire relevant area. Russia sent there a simply colossal amount of its military resources – artillery, equipment, people. All our defenders there are simply heroes. Ukrainian defense is strong in Kharkiv region, and the invaders' attempts to attack all the time fail. The struggle in the south of the country gives good news about the destruction of the forces and means of the Russian army. We do not lose a single day – we reduce the potential of the occupiers. It is very important that the export grain initiative gives results. Since the start of its implementation, a total of 16 vessels with grain for seven countries on three continents have left Ukrainian ports. These are Europe, Asia, Africa. Almost half a million tonnes of agricultural products were on board: corn, wheat, sunflower oil, soybeans and other goods absolutely necessary for the global market. This has already made it possible to reduce the severity of the food crisis, and has given some hope of peace to the countries that consume our agricultural products. And in the long run, it can help to completely remove the food crisis from the global agenda. Of course, if the partners ensure the implementation of the security part of the initiative and prevent Russian provocations and terror at sea or against our ports. The first vessel to be loaded within the framework of the UN World Food Program has already arrived. It is the supply of grain, in particular for Ethiopia, where the situation with hunger is particularly severe. Now the vessel is being prepared for departure from the Pivdenny port. For Ukraine, this has significant benefits. In less than two weeks, three of our ports – Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdenny – managed to export such a volume, which is equal to the entire agricultural export by road for July and more than two-thirds of the export by rail for the past month. I want to emphasize once again: these are jobs for our people, these are the funds needed for our sowing season next year, and these are the revenues of our state budget. Increasing economic activity is a necessary element of the path to victory. I am grateful to everyone who defends our country! Grateful to everyone in the partner countries who help fight against terror! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We are getting ready for the very active weeks of the second half of August – negotiations, meetings, the Crimea Platform, new appeals to foreign communities, international legal activity – on our initiative. This week, I will continue to expand our ties with African states and the Latin American region. Important contacts will take place at the European level tomorrow. In a few days, a ceremony of the presentation of credentials by the ambassadors of foreign countries who came to work in Kyiv will take place. Although there is a certain pause in global politics now - after all, it is August, for Ukraine, for the interests of our state, there haven’t been and will not be any pauses. We are working on new sanctions against Russia and on stimulating the citizens of the terrorist state to feel their share of responsibility for what is happening. The discussion about visa restrictions in Europe for holders of Russian passports is expanding every day, new states and new politicians are joining it. Ultimately, this should lead to appropriate decisions. I am grateful to our intelligence officers, law enforcement officers, journalists and everyone who works to establish the full data on the Russian killers. Ukraine and our partners are receiving more and more information about those directly responsible for terror and torture, for the so-called filtration and deportation of our people, for looting... All these savages will definitely be held to account. But we must remember that when evil takes on such proportions, people's silence approaches the level of complicity. And the rejection of the real fight against evil becomes the assistance to it. Therefore, if you have Russian citizenship and you are silent, it means that you are not fighting, it means that you are supporting it. And no matter where you are - both on the territory of Russia and abroad - your voice should sound in support of Ukraine, and therefore against this war. In the near future, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine will have to make a decision on the extension of martial law and general mobilization. An obvious decision, obvious reasons. Ukraine has always longed and longs for peace and many times in various negotiation formats has offered the Russian leadership to end the war and free Ukrainian land from occupation. But so far, Russia believes in terror, remains in the grip of its propaganda illusions and still hopes that it can supposedly achieve something through various forms of blackmail. It won’t. And therefore, we must defend ourselves, we must respond to every manifestation of terror, to all shelling occasions - brutal shelling that does not stop for a single day. Unfortunately, we have losses. But we must fight at all levels and on all fronts, strengthen our state as much as possible, preserve our unity and attract even more countries to our anti-war coalition. The stronger Ukraine will be, the weaker Russia will be, and therefore, the less time this war will last. And everyone in Ukraine, everyone in the free world must do everything in their power and everything possible so that Russia and those who support the war pay an ever greater price for Russian state terror. I am thankful to all our defenders! I am thankful to all Ukrainians - all those who hold on, who help others, who believe in victory and bring it closer by their actions - as they can. Each new day should bring a new result for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! And all Europeans whose lives are already endangered by Russian terror. Russia does not stop its blackmail in and around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Provocative shelling of the NPP territory continues. Under the cover of the plant, the occupiers are shelling nearby cities and communities. The Russian troops hide ammunition and equipment right in the facilities of the plant. De facto the plant is mined. All this clearly shows that Russia is rejecting the security demands of the European Union countries and 15 other countries - 42 in total - that called on Russia to withdraw its forces from the plant. In particular, these are Turkey, Georgia, Great Britain, Korea, Japan, Australia, Canada, the United States of America. If a terrorist state allows itself to completely ignore the demands of the international community, especially in such a sensitive topic, this clearly indicates the need for immediate action. Any radiation incident at the Zaporizhzhia NPP can affect the countries of the European Union, Turkey, Georgia and countries from more distant regions. Everything depends solely on the direction and speed of the wind. If Russia's actions cause a catastrophe, the consequences may also hit those who remain silent so far. This issue has already been brought to the highest international level - the UN and the IAEA. Of course, Russian nuclear blackmail is also discussed between states. There is a corresponding statement from the ministers of foreign affairs of the G7. They clearly understand that Russia is responsible for this nuclear crisis. But we need to move from discussions and calls to new tough sanctions against Russia, against Rosatom and the entire nuclear industry of the terrorist state. All Russian troops must be immediately withdrawn from the plant and neighboring areas without any conditions. The world has been fighting for many decades for proper control over all activities with nuclear materials and radiation safety. And if now the world lacks the strength and determination to protect one nuclear plant, it means that the world loses. Loses to terrorists. Gives in to nuclear blackmail. And this may be a precedent that other terrorists will see. There is still a chance to prevent this defeat. I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. The main item on the agenda is a thorough analysis of the military-strategic situation. Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate Budanov and Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service Lytvynenko delivered reports. A separate report was delivered by Commander of the Special Operations Forces Khorenko. Of course, there were Zaluzhny, Shaptala, Monastyrskyi, Danilov, Yermak, Reznikov. We also considered - from what can be said publicly - the issue of providing our military with weapons and ammunition and the status of implementation of the previous decisions of the Staff - all of them must be implemented 100%, the responsibility for this is personal. A rather productive meeting of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine took place today. Among other things, the deputies voted for two members of the High Council of Justice. I continue to establish relations at the highest level with African countries. Today I spoke with the President of Niger - until today there were no contacts at this level between our states. I thanked him for the support within the UN. Of course, the key threats to global security were discussed. I held a meeting on the preparation of the Crimea Platform. I expect the expansion of geography, level and number of participants. Today, the Advisory Council on the Deoccupation of Crimea was created to coordinate all measures and projects in this direction and ensure the activities of the Crimea Platform. I met with Andriy Shevchenko and actor Liev Schreiber, ambassadors of our state charity platform UNITED24. We discussed how we can maintain the maximum attention of the world to the needs of our defense. Each week, this task becomes increasingly important. Russia has created so many crises, including the crisis of the cost of living in many countries, as well as food and energy crises, that spread insecurity and irritation with life throughout the world. We must keep global attention focused on the root cause of these crises, namely: Russian aggression. And we have to remind that it was Ukraine that suffered the most from Russian terror. I am grateful to all who perform this important function, in particular the UNITED24 ambassadors. Their activity means billions of hryvnias for Ukraine and a constant increase in attention to the needs of our state and people. The situation on the frontline has not undergone significant changes over the past day. The heroic resistance of our military continues in Donbas, the Kharkiv region. We are putting pressure on the enemy in the south of our country. I would like to especially thank all our gunners, our intelligence officers, the Security Service of Ukraine and all others who ensure the successive destruction of the occupiers' command posts and their ammunition depots. All Russian terrorists should know that every meter of Ukrainian land is an absolute danger for them. No matter how they try to hide. No matter where it is. They will be found and destroyed. Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to everyone who helps our state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Every day and every night we see new reports of explosions in the territory temporarily occupied by the occupiers. I am now asking all our people in Crimea, in other regions in the south of the country, in the occupied areas of Donbas, in the Kharkiv region to be very careful. Please do not approach the military objects of the Russian army and all those places where they store ammunition and equipment, where they keep their headquarters. The reasons for the explosions in the occupied territory can be different, very different, in particular, I quote the definition of the occupiers themselves, \"bungling\". But they all have the same meaning: the destruction of the occupiers' logistics, their ammunition, military and other equipment, command posts saves the lives of our people. The fewer opportunities the occupiers have to do evil and kill Ukrainians, the sooner we will be able to end this war by liberating our land. And the queue these days to leave Crimea for Russia across the bridge proves that the absolute majority of citizens of the terrorist state already understand or at least feel that Crimea is not a place for them. And I want to thank all Ukrainians who help our Armed Forces, our intelligence, our special services weaken the army of the occupiers. This is a significant advantage of Ukraine and the root cause of our future victory - the struggle of our defenders is based on the unconditional support of the Ukrainian people. This is a people's war of liberation, this is an all-Ukrainian struggle for freedom and independence for our country. Ukraine is protected by millions in one way or another. Millions of people who fight at the front, who fight for their cities and villages, including in the occupation, who stopped the occupiers' military equipment, who informed and inform our intelligence and special services, who oppose the occupiers in their rear, who ensure the necessary supplies for Ukraine and the work of all our state institutions and economy, who volunteer, who fight for our interests abroad, who fight in the information war. And we have to do - and will do - everything to preserve this nationwide foundation of defense. For the support of Ukraine in the world not to decrease and for our state to move towards victory, our own activity should not decrease either - the activity of absolutely everyone who in one way or another stood up for the defense of our state. Do everything, as you have been doing, for Ukraine. And even more, because the leadership of Russia expects that Ukrainians, Europeans and the whole world will get tired of this war. We must do everything so that it is not us or our friends and partners who get tired, but our enemy. For us to expel the occupiers from Ukraine, every day must make it more and more difficult for Russia to wage a war - this is our number one military-political task. I spoke today with President of France Emmanuel Macron. I informed him about the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and regular Russian provocations. I thanked him for the great support. In particular, Mr. President and I have discussed new security and macro-financial assistance to our state. I also held talks with the Prime Minister of Denmark. Also about increasing financial support for Ukraine, about new sanctions against Russia. I thanked Mrs. Frederiksen for the defense assistance and for the fruitful conference in Copenhagen which recently agreed on concrete decisions for our defense. For the first time in the history of our bilateral relations, I held talks with the President of Zambia. Cooperation in international organizations, food security and current global threats were discussed. Ban Ki-moon, the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations, and Juan Manuel Santos, ex-President of Colombia, visited Ukraine today. The main topic of conversation with them is security guarantees for Ukraine. We are doing everything to form a military, political and legal security architecture for Ukraine, which will be real, effective and work in the long term, guaranteeing peace to our people. The Russian army continued its absolutely senseless and brutal shelling of the cities of the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk regions - Orikhiv, Nikopol... Unfortunately, there are wounded, unfortunately, there are casualties. Shelling of Kharkiv and the border areas continues. But all this will not give anything to the occupiers and will not break our resistance. Our heroes repel constant and very powerful attacks in Donbas. The occupiers use everything there: aviation, missiles, phosphorus bombs, artillery... Very fierce battles are going on. We have to go through it, endure everything and gain life. Ukraine must win, and it will. Today I signed the decree on awarding our defenders. 189 warriors were awarded state awards. 158 are National Guard servicemen, 21 of them were awarded posthumously. 26 border guards, two of them posthumously. Three police officers, two of them posthumously. Two employees of the State Customs Service, one of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Rector! Dear students and university teachers who joined our conversation today! Dear journalists and everyone present! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you and tell you what is happening in Ukraine and why the Russian war against our country is still going on. Why there is no peace. A full-scale war, a full-scale Russian invasion of the territory of Ukraine has been going on for 175 days. For 175 days, millions of Ukrainians have defended the independence of our state. But not only independence. This is a struggle not only for the state and not only for the opportunity of our people to independently decide their future. Indeed, the primary motive of Russian aggression against Ukrainians is purely colonialist – the Russian leadership wants its domination over Ukrainian land and over our resources. And for a long time it was heard in Moscow that they would not restore the Russian empire without seizing the territory of Ukraine. However, it became a much deeper struggle than any imperial or geopolitical intentions. Russia is literally waging a war against the lives of our people, against the very right to life of Ukrainians. And this war started not 175 days ago. On February 24 of this year, Russia switched to massive aggression – to attacks from the north, from the east, and from the south at once; all our ports on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov were blocked; massive missile strikes were launched throughout the territory of Ukraine. But it was a continuation of the war. The war that began in 2014. It began when Russia occupied the Crimean peninsula, ignited the confrontation in Donbas, which claimed thousands of lives. They were thousands. Therefore, when we talk about Russia's war against Ukraine, we are talking about eight years and 175 days. And when we talk about the victims of this war, about Ukrainian losses, we do not start the story from February 2022. We start it in 2014, when Ukrainians began to be killed simply because they were Ukrainians. For the Ukrainian flag. For a pro-Ukrainian position. For defending the Ukrainian territory. Even simply for the suspicion that a person supports the Ukrainian state. Today I want to tell you about one such person. About a guy who would have turned 25 this fall, and he would probably be a lot like you right now. His name was Stepan Chubenko. He was from the city of Kramatorsk in Donbas. Bright young man. He was remembered as kind and very active – if he had entered a university similar to yours, he would probably have become one of the student leaders. Perhaps he would not have betrayed his dream and chosen the path of a sports career – and he would have been able to become the goalkeeper of one of the teams you know. I ask you to look at these photos now – that's the kind of guy he was. He was killed on July 27, 2014. He was killed by militants – one of those whose hands Russia used to wage a hybrid war in Donbas and whom it is now using in the full-scale war. They detained Stepan when he was returning home. They saw a yellow and blue ribbon on his backpack – the colors of our flag. And that was reason enough for them to grab the boy. He was beaten for several days, tortured, and shot. Only in the middle of August of that year, weeks after the murder, Stepan's mother managed to find out what happened to her son. But she was not given his body. Only in November 2014 it was possible to bury him. Stepan's mother has the last text message from him: \"I'll call you later, I love you.\" His killers hid in the territory of Russia and Crimea occupied by Russia. They received sentences from the Ukrainian court. But the terrorist state Russia protects them from being prosecuted. Them and thousands of other such murderers. Those who shot people simply because they were Ukrainians. Simply because they were Ukrainians in Ukraine. Those who shot men and women in the back of the head for the mere suspicion that the person was defending our state. Those who shot at residential buildings, at schools and hospitals point blank from tanks. Those who used artillery to bombard peaceful cities. It started back then – in 2014, and 175 days ago it reached the maximum scale that the Russian army, Russian mercenaries from the so-called military companies, which are de facto part of the secret services of the terrorist state, are capable of. Russia really wants to seize the territory of Ukraine. And it needs this territory without Ukrainians. The destroyed Mariupol and dozens of other cities and villages of Ukraine, the Bucha massacre and other cities in the occupied territory are not exceptions to the general Russian strategy, this is what it is – the Russian strategy towards Ukraine and Ukrainians. Tens of thousands of our people are kept for months in the so-called \"filtration camps\" set up by the Russian military. Thousands of Ukrainian children were deported from the territory entered by the Russian army. They are taken to Russia, and Russian officials are trying to do everything so that these children lose all contact with their families and simply forget who they are. Monuments and museums that simply remind of Ukraine are being destroyed on the occupied territory. They destroy books. They do everything so that people are forced to give up their national identity, their aspirations, dreams, and obey violence and robbery or die. Ukraine has already lost the lives of tens of thousands of its people in this war. Very small children – one-month-old babies, who were killed by Russian missiles, shells and bullets. Teenagers. Men and women. Elderly people. Russia does not care who to kill and who to abuse. Everyone is equally its target. And these are not excesses of war. This is its conscious policy. Therefore, we have no other choice but to fight for the lives of Ukrainians, so that in Ukraine they are not killed for a yellow-blue ribbon on a teenager's backpack. And this struggle can last only until victory. I can't count how many times before February 24 I suggested to Russia to end the war and negotiate peace. In different formats, through different mediation. It took many years to negotiate. But the leadership of Russia chose terror, not an agreement. They chose what they did in Mariupol, in Bucha, not peace. And when Moscow saw that the world would not turn a blind eye to Russian atrocities, they wanted to bring the whole world to its knees. That is why the food crisis has become so acute. That is why Russia is deliberately destabilizing the energy markets. That is why Russian policy is deepening the crisis of the cost of living in many countries for mercenary motives. And this is why we must jointly resist Russian aggression. When a state turns energy poverty or hunger into a weapon, it is a blow to everyone in the world. When a state tries to conquer another because it wants to be a colonizer, it is a threat to all who value their independence. And when people are killed simply because they are, because they belong to their people, because they do not give up their homeland, it is a threat to humanity as such. Can you stay away? Can you stay indifferent? I don't believe that. That is why you are here today, because you value the truth. And I'm not asking too much of you. I ask you to spread only the truth – spread the truth about this war in your country and in your region. It is necessary to oppose Russian propaganda. Demand full accountability for Russian murderers and executioners. Every war crime must receive its verdict by a competent and honest court. Support sanctions against Russia – because the aggressor must pay the highest price for aggression. And most importantly, value peace, value life, value your freedom and always, when you have such an opportunity, help defend peace, life and freedom by protecting those from whom they want to take it. I am very grateful to each of you, thank you for your attention!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Diplomacy in the interests of our country is very active these days. First of all, today a ceremony of presenting credentials to the new ambassadors of foreign countries who arrived to work in our capital was held in the Sophia of Kyiv. The work of embassies in full capacity, the presence of ambassadors in Kyiv is one of the important indicators of the strength of our state, the Ukrainian ability to fight and win. Already 55 diplomatic missions have resumed their work. And today, the new ambassadors of Belgium, Spain, Kyrgyzstan and Romania presented their credentials. Secondly, UN Secretary General António Guterres has already arrived in Ukraine. We will work to get the necessary results for Ukraine. Thirdly, Ukrainian diplomats, our nuclear scientists and the IAEA are in constant touch, now they are working on sending the IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Only absolute transparency and controlled situation at and around the ZNPP can guarantee a gradual return to normal nuclear safety for the Ukrainian state, for the international community, and for the IAEA. The Russian army must withdraw from the territory of the nuclear power plant and all neighboring areas, and take away its military equipment from the plant. This must happen without any conditions and as soon as possible. Ukraine is ready to ensure proper control of the IAEA, and the relevant mission can be sent to the Zaporizhzhia plant in a legal way, very fast and as efficiently as possible. Today, I made a very important address to the university communities, journalists and political circles of Chile and Latin America in general. This is not an easy direction of foreign policy – we are doing many things there now practically from scratch. We are working not only at the political level, but also establishing relations directly with the societies of the countries of this region. I called on Chileans and all freedom-loving people in Latin America to spread the truth about Russia's war against our country and to support the sanctions policy aimed at making the terrorist state pay the highest possible price for terror. In the evening, I signed new decrees on awarding our soldiers. 230 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were given state awards, 43 of them posthumously. Also, 24 employees of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine were awarded state awards. All our soldiers – our army, our intelligence, border guards, the National Guard, the SBU and everyone involved in defending our state and people are doing everything possible to fight Russian terrorists and push them out of Ukrainian land. The Avdiyivka area, Bakhmut area, Kharkiv region, and some other regions are the regions where the most difficult fighting is going on right now. I am grateful to everyone who withstands this pressure, who defends positions and helps our soldiers. In Zaporizhzhia region, in some areas of the south of the country, the occupiers are trying to improve their situation, but strategically it is hopeless for them. Ukrainian soldiers will destroy the potential of the occupiers step by step, and the day will come when the enemy will die in Zaporizhzhia, in the south, in the east of the country, and in Crimea. The invaders will die like dew on the sun, and our defense is and will be this sun. Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to all those who focused on helping our people in a true Ukrainian unity! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we are in Lviv, the Potocki Palace, now. At the end of this very busy day, here’s my report on events, meetings, negotiations and decisions. We have been here since the morning. And once again I want to thank the city of Lviv, all Lviv residents for the attention, comfort and emotional support felt throughout the day. First of all, I paid a visit to our defenders - those who are being treated after injuries in the hospital. Very brave guys, strong. I thanked the doctors who are doing everything to restore the health of our warriors as soon as possible. I was very happy to see the boys and girls studying at the Petro Sahaidachnyi National Ground Forces Academy. It was extremely pleasant to hear that more and more people want to become officers of the Ukrainian army. The competition for one place in the academy is of such a scale that used to be only in civilian universities before. And this really gives a reason to be proud not just of the patriotism of our youth, but of the fact that people believe in Ukraine, in our Armed Forces, in our victory. I presented awards to the best warriors. During a special ceremony on the Field of Mars of the Lychakiv Cemetery, we honored the memory of all those who gave their lives for Ukraine and for the independence of our country in this brutal war. There is no other alternative - we must return everything of ours and guarantee security for all future generations of Ukraine. I held talks with UN Secretary-General Guterres and President of Türkiye Erdoğan. Most of the points discussed are already in the news. I want to say a few main things now. First. There are no objective obstacles to prevent the IAEA mission from reaching the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Today, Mr. Guterres and I discussed the parameters of this mission and the fact that it can get to the plant very quickly and quite safely in a legal way through the free territory of our state. And just like that. The one who organized nuclear blackmail certainly cannot be the \"transporter\" of any such missions. Russia must immediately and unconditionally allow IAEA representatives to the plant and also immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops from the territory of the plant. The world has the power to ensure this. If it does not ensure this, we can simply throw the entire body of international documents on nuclear and radiation safety into the trash. Russia is destroying this international order. The second extremely important point of the negotiations is Ukrainian prisoners of war held by the Russian Federation. I called on Mr. Secretary-General to use all the capabilities of the UN to ensure Russia's compliance with all norms of international law regarding prisoners of war. And we discussed sending a fact-finding mission to Olenivka. The full truth about this Russian terrorist attack must and will be established. Of course, we talked about the grain export initiative. The result is there - and not only for Ukraine, but also for the world, as it is felt that the severity of the global food crisis is decreasing. Therefore, there is a great need for more security, a greater volume of exports, more ships that can deliver Ukrainian food from our ports. I held very substantive negotiations on many topics today with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. I am grateful to him for his unwavering support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. We discussed defense, economic and energy cooperation. I am grateful to Türkiye for its willingness to take under patronage the reconstruction of Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region. This is a mission for a truly powerful country. Today, the first step was taken - an agreement on infrastructure was signed. I called on both Mr. President and Mr. Secretary-General to voice the strictest possible position regarding Russia's planned pseudo-referendums in the occupied territory. Any pseudo-referendum will be a slap in the face of the international community. And I want to mention one more thing today. It was an extremely hard night in Kharkiv - more than ten people died. Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia were again shelled. The Russian army is spending enormous resources to capture at least one more kilometer in Donbas. Russian officials reiterate threats to Odesa and other cities of Ukraine. We see what is happening at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. We see what happened in Olenivka. We can and should think only about how to win. To win on the battlefield, on the political front, in the information confrontation, in the economic plane, everywhere... Let’s believe in ourselves, help each other, protect the interests of Ukraine and know that there will be peace. He who fights and fights wisely wins. Eternal glory to all our warriors! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken away by the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All Europeans! For 177 days already, the report on the events in Ukraine is important for the entire continent. Ukrainian diplomats, our partners, representatives of the UN and the IAEA are working out the specific details of the mission to be sent to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. With this mission, the restoration of full security at the ZNPP and in Enerhodar can begin. And I am grateful to everyone who joined this work and initiative. If Russian blackmail with radiation continues, this summer may go down in the history of various European countries as one of the most tragic of all time. Because not a single instruction at any nuclear power plant in the world envisages a procedure in case a terrorist state turns a nuclear power plant into a target. Of course, today it is worth paying attention to another aspect of Russian blackmail in the field of energy. Gas supplies to Germany via the first Nord Stream are again being restricted and absurd statements are being made again that it is allegedly possible to compensate for something via Nord Stream 2. These \"streams\" are needed by Russia exclusively to supply problems to Europe, not to help someone there with gas. Now it is absolutely obvious. The longer the terrorist state remains on the European and world energy market, the longer it will not be stable. And the sooner everyone in Europe prepares their energy systems to exist without any supply of energy carriers from Russia, the sooner they will be able to calmly go through any winter. Today there was a very important visit to Ukraine by Eurocities representatives led by the mayor of Florence. This Association unites the mayors of more than 150 European cities, as well as representatives of dozens of other partner cities. We will cooperate with them directly - Ukrainian cities and communities with European cities and communities. The key issue is, of course, the rebuilding of our cities. The relevant memorandum was signed today. But not only this will be the subject of our important cooperation. The modern development of any country is primarily the development of cities, the creation of new opportunities and institutions in cities, the exchange of experience between cities and urban institutions. And therefore, these are new jobs, greater social capital and higher level of security for people. On the Ukrainian side, the subject of relations with the Association of European Cities will be our Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. I want to assure that every city of our state will benefit from this. We are interested in sustainable development throughout the territory of Ukraine - and it will be so. Without any exceptions. And today I want to address separately the residents of all our cities of Ukraine, which are subjected to constant brutal shelling by Russia. Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, all the cities of Donbas, the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Zaporizhzhia region... All those who experience this constant horror of the destruction of life and the destruction of everything that gives life normality. We will not leave any of these strikes unanswered. We will establish the identity of every occupier who gives orders and executes these strikes at cities. And we will bring them all to justice in one way or another. No murderer will hide. And we will certainly restore everything that the terrorists try to leave in ruins. The word \"ruins\" will never be a word about Ukraine, will never be a word about our cities. Russia will definitely not succeed in this. Eternal glory to all who bring our victory closer! Eternal glory to all who fight for our beautiful, strong Ukraine, for our people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians I wish you health! We are actively preparing for the new week, which is very important for all of us, for our country. Our Flag Day, our Independence Day is ahead. The commemoration of veterans of the war for the freedom of Ukraine is ahead. The Crimean platform is ahead. This year it is really special. This year, one can literally feel in the air of Crimea that the occupation there is temporary, and Ukraine is returning. We will definitely remember our legends – this is and will be a Ukrainian tradition. Let us remember those whose lives have become a part of our national history, which can never be erased by anyone – by no enemy. Next week, as usual, important negotiations and visits of true friends of Ukraine are planned... A significant milestone is ahead – six months of this full-scale invasion. The war that changed everything for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the world. Of course, there will be time to tell about it. And tell in detail. But let's still think today, take a look, assess the path we have taken. How much has been changed – what almost everyone in the world thought was impossible to change. How much it was managed to win, wrest from the Russian army, which for decades was thought to be invincible. I remember the first days of the full-scale invasion, I remember what various \"advisors\" told me and advised me then... I know that many of them are now ashamed of the words that were said then. Since February 24, during these 178 days, Ukrainians have proven that our people are invincible, our defenders are invincible. And I thank everyone who showed their strength during this time, I thank everyone who fought and is fighting for Ukraine, I thank everyone who fights and helps our soldiers, our state. Our unity, our faith in ourselves made it possible to pass these six months and approach this week, which is always important for every Ukrainian. We have always said and we say honestly: for the sake of Ukraine's victory, we still need to fight, we still need to do a lot, we still need to persevere and endure, unfortunately, a lot of pain. But Ukrainians can feel proud of themselves, their country, and their heroes. And let's all feel it together today - let's feel the power of our people, our beautiful people. This power has always been and will be – as long as we believe in ourselves, as long as we preserve our unity, as long as we fight for Ukraine, and as long as we work for our common Ukrainian victory. We should be aware that this week Russia may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel. Such is our enemy. But in any other week during these six months, Russia did the same thing all the time – disgusting and cruel. One of the key tasks of the enemy is to humiliate us, Ukrainians, to devalue our capabilities, our heroes, to spread despair, fear, to spread conflicts... Therefore, it is important never, for a single moment, to give in to this enemy pressure, not to wind oneself up, not to show weakness. We must all be strong enough to resist any enemy provocations – as much as it takes to make the occupiers answer for all their blows and terror – for Kharkiv and Donbas, for Azovstal and Mykolaiv, for the filtration camps, for Bucha , Irpin for all cities... We must all be strong enough to endure and go all the way to Ukrainian victory. That's why we stay together! We help each other! We restore the destroyed! We fight for all our people. And we cheer for those who represent Ukraine, today – definitely for Usyk, our boy! We believe in ourselves! We believe in Ukraine! Glory to each and every one of you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good night, Ukrainians! All our defenders! The 180th day of our defense and a new week begin. The week we look forward to every year, as it is the time of our main holiday, the holiday of Ukraine - Independence Day. And this week the occupiers definitely did not expect to be such... They could not have imagined that even now, after six months of such a brutal war, we will celebrate our independence on our land and in our capital. But it is so. This is our land. This is our independence, which no one can break and no one can take away. And you know it is so. Everyone in Ukraine feels it. 180 days - almost six months - the absolute majority of our people have no doubt that we will achieve the victory of Ukraine. We are united, we are more confident now than we have been in many decades. And this is one of the foundations of our strength, our power. And therefore, it is one of the main targets for Russian terrorists. They strike at the feelings of Ukrainians, at the wounds in the souls of our people just as at our cities... They strike cruelly, cynically. But with a different weapon. And not only with propaganda, not only with lies. Tormenting people, all those who suffer the biggest pain, the greatest difficulties, is one of the terrible means of pressure, which has become commonplace for Russia. And now there are enough reports in the media that in Mariupol the scenery is being prepared for an absolutely disgusting and absurd show trial of Ukrainian defenders, of our warriors who are captives of the occupiers. No matter what the occupiers are thinking, no matter what they are planning, the reaction of our state will be absolutely clear. If this despicable show trial takes place, if our people are brought into this scenery in violation of all agreements, all international rules, if there is abuse... This will be the line beyond which any negotiations are impossible. Russia will cut itself off from the negotiations. There will be no more conversations. Our state has said everything. All partners of Ukraine have been informed about what the terrorist state can prepare for this week. Today I spoke with President Macron about all the threats. President of Türkiye Erdoğan is also informed about all this. The Secretary-General of the UN, I am sure, will also react. They and other world leaders received appropriate signals from us. Everyone understands everything. They understand what the occupiers are doing and what it threatens. And they understand that Ukraine will not tolerate this. It will not tolerate tormenting of people about whom only one thing can be said: they are heroes of their Homeland, they defended the freedom of their people from invaders on their land. Even in times of war, there must be rules. The power of the world is definitely enough to bring any state, any terrorist under the power of these rules. Well, all of us - all Ukrainians - must remember one thing: no matter what, our goal is victory. No matter what, we are heading towards victory in spite of everything. No matter what, glory to all our warriors! Ukraine is above everything! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report on the activity during the day. I took part in the work of a special forum of veterans. And announced changes in state policy regarding the veteran community - we must create more opportunities for veterans. Without such changes, without this reform, it is simply impossible. Veterans of the war for independence of Ukraine have become one of the most significant and respected groups in our society. With their specificity, with their needs, with their expectations, which must be responded to so that veterans can contribute not only to the defense of our state on the frontline, but also to the post-war development of Ukraine. And not only the state must react, but also business, which is very important, employers, education. We will create such a system of veteran policy and services for veterans, opportunities for their transition from military affairs to civilian life, which will be on a par with the strongest similar systems in the world. You can cite the example of the Israeli model, as well as the American one. But our goal is for the Ukrainian experience of veteran policy to eventually become a new example for others in the world to follow. I held a large meeting with representatives of the defense and security sector. Zaluzhny, Monastyrskyi, Danilov, Budanov and others were present. The key issues are, of course, the situation on the frontline, the security situation in big cities, as well as specific security measures due to the holidays and important political events this week - meetings, negotiations. We are already fully prepared for the second summit of the Crimea Platform. This year's summit will be even more powerful than last year, in terms of both the number of participants and the topics of discussion. We are significantly expanding the format of the Crimea Platform - tomorrow we will announce all the details. And today the new diplomatic and security format \"Kyiv Initiative\" was founded. Ukraine's European neighbors are already participating in its work. These are Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and the Baltic states. We will gradually involve other countries. In the \"Kyiv Initiative\" format, the work takes place at the level of foreign policy advisors to the heads of state. From the Ukrainian side, these are Andriy Sybiha and Andriy Yermak. And this format will allow us to strengthen cooperation in the region and joint protection of our interests, primarily security. This is a very promising line of our work in the Euro-Atlantic direction. Today there is good infrastructural news - the railway branch connecting Ukraine and Moldova has been upgraded and launched. Moreover, we did it both on our territory and on the territory of Moldova - our \"Ukrzaliznytsia\" did it, well done. This route has been closed for almost 25 years, and now it is working for Ukraine again. This is an important transport direction. And the average volume of cargo per year can be about 10 million tons. I am grateful to our partners from Moldova. Search operations at the site of the occupiers' attack on a residential building in Kharkiv have ended. The building was destroyed by Russian shelling last Wednesday. Only today we managed to get the bodies of all the dead from under the rubble. This Russian strike alone claimed the lives of 19 people. One strike. And savages have not stopped such strikes at different parts of our country for 180 days. The total number of various cruise missiles that Russia has used against us is approaching 3,500. It is simply impossible to count the strikes of Russian artillery - there are too many of them, they are too intense. And at the same time, the terrorist state does not stop playing around with international structures and once again has the audacity to convene the UN Security Council to discuss its own provocations, its own terror at the Zaporizhzhia NPP... I am grateful to all European politicians who do not forget that the eighth sanctions package against Russia is needed. The longer the interval between sanctions packages is, the greater Russia's audacity is. And I am grateful to all our friends, all friends of freedom in different countries of the world, who promote the need to recognize the objective reality and legally define Russia as a terrorist state. This decision will come sooner or later, and the only question is how many more lives Russia will manage to take away before the retaliatory strikes from the international community become truly tangible for those responsible for this terror. And, dear Ukrainians, especially these days, when we celebrate the day of our flag and the day of our independence, if you are somewhere abroad, please remind about Ukraine there, be there with the Ukrainian flag and spread the truth about the crimes of the occupiers. Let's all stick together, no matter where we, Ukrainians, are! Glory to all who protect the state! Gratitude to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear participants and guests of the Crimea Platform, present here and there, not far from us, and we feel it! Dear citizens of Ukraine from Crimea and in Crimea. I know you are watching and hearing us today. It is very important for us. It is very important for me. For society, for each and every one of us. I know that Crimea stands with Ukraine and is waiting for us to return. I want you all to know, we will definitely be back. When we return and correct everything that the occupiers did on our Ukrainian peninsula. What has come to Crimea and the entire Black Sea region along with Russian aggression and Russian weapons? Catastrophic environmental threats, unprecedented destruction of Crimea's nature, destruction of social life, economic decline, destruction of monuments, militarism. And when the Russian fleet, which is based in the occupied Crimea, blocked our ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, it provoked a global food crisis and the crisis of the rights of people - Crimeans, our wonderful citizens, citizens of our unitary state of Ukraine. But - in spite of everything, in spite of any threats - Ukraine is strong enough and capable enough to see a perspective for the Ukrainian Crimea. I have the honor to announce the start of the Second Summit of the Crimea Platform. In a year, we managed to significantly expand the capabilities of the Crimea Platform, Minister Kuleba mentioned that. Last year, 46 foreign countries and international organizations participated in the summit. This year the figure is almost 60. I am grateful to everyone. Much more state leaders - 40 presidents and prime ministers, including the leaders of the G7. I am grateful to all of you for understanding how important such actions are now - your support, our joint actions and our joint work. This year, representatives of two more continents - Africa and South America - have joined, and this demonstrates that there is no boundary in the world that the truth about the Russian war against Ukraine and our people would not overcome. Of course, it is obvious whom we have to fight. The presence of obvious security risks dictates that the summit takes place in online mode. But international practice has already proven that such a regime can be absolutely effective for politics, diplomacy, and most importantly, for the protection of freedom. And especially now I want to thank one of the leaders who is with us here in Kyiv today - Andrzej Duda, the President of Poland and a true friend of all Ukrainians. Andrzej, your presence next to me, next to the people of Ukraine, once again confirms the extremely close ties and historical understanding that exist between Ukrainians and Poles. Thank you! Ladies and Gentlemen! When I speak to our citizens, I often use the honorific address: all our defenders. In fact, today, addressing you, honorable leaders, honorable ministers, I can use the same words and with a related meaning: all defenders of the international legal order! This is why we are here today, this is why the Crimea Platform was established and has been working for a year already. We are restoring the power of international law, and it is thanks to this that we will return the Ukrainian flag to our land of Crimea, it is thanks to this that we will bring freedom to Ukrainian citizens in Crimea and certainly restore justice for all those who suffered from repression and abuse by the Russian occupiers. But to win, we must not forget the path that led to the current situation. The degradation of Russia began with the seizure of Crimea. It started with terror against the Crimean Tatar people, the indigenous people of Crimea. With repression on religious grounds, which probably became the largest religious persecution in Europe in the XXI century, against the Crimean Muslim community. There was also the expulsion from occupied Crimea of all ordinary people who said that Crimea is Ukraine, who were not afraid to defend Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian freedom in Crimea. Murders and torture - we saw it all - humiliation and looting - the occupiers committed all this in Crimea and continue to commit all this since the first weeks after its shameful capture. And then they spread these crimes to Donbas, to other countries, in particular to Syria, to African countries, where Russian banditry under the cover of Russian special services is now seen. Mass terror after February 24 became the logical completion of the degradation of this state, which not so long ago was invited to the table with the G7 and which now competes for supremacy with the most brutal regimes of the past, responsible for genocides, wars of aggression and deportations. We are grateful that many people in the world did not keep silent about all this, many people constantly resisted - helped us, fought. But at the same time, many remained silent - and it is true - tried not to notice what was happening in Crimea. And this, in my opinion, became one of the key reasons for everything that is happening now in Ukraine and in the world. It is important to remember that there was resistance on the peninsula. There were and are people, we know, who are not silent, who defend freedom and simply defend normal life in Crimea. They are oppressed. But we see them, we know about them, we are grateful to them. I recently received a letter from one of the qırımlılar, Nariman Celâl. Unfortunately, he is now behind bars. The occupiers imprisoned him on a completely false charge, for fighting for the homeland, for taking part in the first summit of the Crimea Platform, which took place last year. Last year, he left the already occupied Crimea to tell the participants of the summit what is really happening on the peninsula and what it all will lead to. And nine days after his return to Crimea, the occupiers deprived him of his freedom. For the fact that he was simply a free man. This was Russia's response. In his letter, Mr. Celâl wrote: \"It began with Crimea, and it will end with Crimea.\" And it really will. I believe in it. In order to overcome terror, to return predictability and security to our region, Europe and the whole world, we need to win the fight against Russian aggression, and therefore we need to free Crimea from occupation. It will end where it began. And this will be an effective resuscitation of the international legal order. But this is not just a political and legal task for the world. This is about a specific land, about specific people living in Crimea. About cities, about culture, about specific landmarks. About hopes of specific living people. About the fact that someone invested his life in Crimea, and after the arrival of Russia, was forced to leave it and seek refuge in other lands, or fear that something of his own would be taken away: a house, land, work, any business... And he was forced to limit himself. Or lose everything when it was taken. Russia stole a part of life even from those in Crimea who were lucky enough not to become a victim of repression. It was impossible to imagine such a thing, but the occupation turned Crimea - which is a paradise for all of us - into a depressed and dependent region. Into a region of high fences, barbed wire and lawlessness. Into a zone of environmental disaster and a military bridgehead for aggression and the spread of grief. Since February 24, 750 different cruise missiles have been launched from the occupied Crimea at our cities and communities. Imagine - 750 in six months! They destroyed at least hundreds of civilian objects: schools, universities, ordinary residential buildings, hospitals. And that is why Ukraine's restoration of control over the Crimean peninsula will be a historic anti-war step in Europe. This will restore security and provide justice, this will reintegrate Crimea into the modern world, and this will allow each of us - participants of the Crimea Platform - to tell our children, our relatives and friends that they can be proud of us precisely as peacekeepers. And I want to emphasize: for Ukraine, Crimea is not just some territory, not a chip in the geopolitical game, as for a terrorist state. For Ukraine, Crimea is a part of our people, our society. A community of people to whom we will guarantee freedom and restore modernity. Crimea was and is Ukraine, and after deoccupation, along with our entire state, it will become part of the European Union. I am sure of that. The passport of a citizen of Ukraine will also be the passport of the European Union. These are colossal opportunities for all our people living in Crimea. The roads of Crimea will be the roads of the entire European continent, the ports of Crimea will be the ports of all of Europe. Only Ukraine can connect Simferopol with Berlin, and Yalta with Naples. Only Ukraine is concerned about the real security of Crimea. That is, a normal supply of clean water, normal disposal of garbage, effective rules for waste and sewage management. Only Ukraine can build a modern irrigation system in Crimea and integrate Crimean agricultural production and the entire business sector into the colossal European market. Only our state will provide Crimea with a modern and affordable medical system, a modern and affordable educational system, and a modern digital system of public services. Ukraine will remove the barbed wire that blocks the path of ordinary people to the best locations, and the illegal fences that have torn the coast of our beautiful Crimea. Free access to beaches, real protection of protected areas, historical sites - this will be provided only by Ukraine, not by someone who came to capture, steal and humiliate people. It is Ukraine that will restore the system of sanatoria and rehabilitation centers in Crimea - professional institutions that will be able to host hundreds of thousands of people annually. Millions of tourists. Children and adults, civilians and veterans, our citizens and foreigners - everyone whom the precious nature of Crimea helps. And millions of tourists - at least of the middle class - can come to Crimea stably only thanks to Ukraine. There will never be repressions under the Ukrainian authorities in Crimea, and everyone knows that. The lack of freedom or moral suffocation that Russia brought in 2014. And even more so, Ukraine will never ignore the social needs of pensioners or anyone else in Crimea. Ukraine will never tell people: \"There is no money, but hold on\", because we respect people, and even this year, already in the bloody times of a full-scale war, we indexed pensions for all our pensioners. Ladies and Gentlemen! I think you felt from my words that we have a very elaborated view of how to restore our Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea after the expulsion of the Russian invaders. That is why we are adding two more directions to the work of the Crimea Platform: economic and legislative directions. We have a strategy for the restoration of Crimea - today it will be presented as part of the economic panel. And we are creating a legislative foundation for Crimea - after deoccupation, as well as for all those for whom Crimea is much more than even home. We adopted the Law \"On Indigenous Peoples\", which protected the rights of the Crimean Tatar people and Mejlis, Karaites and Krymchaks. We are developing the Crimean Tatar language. A law was passed on the protection of political prisoners - all those who suffered from the repressions of the occupiers. And these are just some examples. We are not going to stop there - there is still a lot of work to do. This year, the Crimea Platform will be continued in the autumn - in Croatia - with a parliamentary summit. No longer online, with the presence of parliamentary delegations of the world. We use all the power of democracies to protect our state and the international legal order. And, returning to the letter of Nariman Celâl, who was imprisoned by the occupiers, I want to read a few more important words: \"Thanks to the change in the agenda on the world stage, in Europe and in Ukraine itself due to the aggression of the Russian Federation, the members of the Crimea Platform have a more determined attitude focused on the implementation of specific measures.\" The person who was sent to jail by the occupiers only for defending the truth and participating in last year's Crimea Platform hopes for specific measures from all of us - participants of the summit. And we all must not deceive this hope. We all have to be strong and effective. Thank you for your attention! I am grateful to each and every one for participating in our second summit, to everyone present on this platform. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today was a useful day for Ukraine, very meaningful. A day that showed how strong our state has become, and this is not the limit yet. We are doing everything so that the strength of Ukraine, the opportunities of Ukraine, the freedom of Ukraine only increase. Today we celebrate the day of our flag, and it happens at a time when we are fighting against the most dreadful threat to our statehood and at the same time when we have achieved the greatest national unity. That is why we endured. Because we united and united the world around true values. Our national flag has become a global symbol of courage. A symbol of all who value a free life. Where there is blue and yellow, there is no and will be no tyranny. Where there is blue and yellow, there are no and will not be savages. Our flag is everywhere - from the frontline, where our warriors beat the enemy, to capitals on all continents, and it means one thing everywhere - humanity. I am grateful to everyone who defends true values. I am grateful to everyone who helps Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who, since February 24, has chosen the path of struggle for what makes life real: for freedom, for independence. Very soon we will celebrate our main national holiday - our independence. Already tomorrow. We have planned many activities - something that will emphasize the path we have covered. Covered together - Ukrainians in Ukraine, throughout our territory - free and temporarily occupied, because our people are fighting everywhere. Ukrainians abroad - all those who helped, all those who spread the truth about Ukraine, all those who urged to fight for Ukraine. No occupier feels safe on our land. All collaborators know that they have no future. And we all do not just believe - we see that our state has a perspective. And for tomorrow, I have planned to award people who have contributed to our strength. These are people from different areas of life. Our warriors, all those who help warriors. Communication officers, railwaymen, rescuers, media workers, those who inform our people, who work in the national marathon \"United News\". These are utility workers, electricians, drivers, volunteers, officials, athletes, artists - those artists who are known on the frontline, whom the army is grateful to, those who preserve and restore the positive emotions of our warriors. I asked various ministries, regional administrations, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, media representatives to submit their proposals on who deserves awards on Independence Day. It is up to you to decide. And tomorrow the awards will be given to those who really deserve them. Now I am near the office of the Crimea Platform, near the building that symbolizes that we care about every part of Ukraine, about every part of our people - the great Ukrainian people. Crimea is an integral part of our state, Crimea is Ukraine. Crimea is an integral part of our people. And we will certainly come to our cities in Crimea, to our people in Crimea and return to them the freedom that belongs to them by right, as well as to all our other people. That is why we have organized a special format - the Crimean format, the Crimea Platform. We held the inaugural summit last summer and today we have already held the second one. I am grateful to all participants of the summit - 40 leaders, almost 60 states and international organizations. European leaders, leaders of the G7, leaders of the countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America. This is not just a meeting, not just a discussion. The Crimea Platform became a global forum that united the leaders of the free world. This is a community of people who help restore peace and legality for Crimea, for the Black Sea region, for all of Europe. And the fact that we are holding the summit for the second time right now, with the expansion of the representation, is a clear response of the world to Russian aggression. Clear support for our sovereignty and territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders. Russian aggression began in Crimea, and its finale will be in Crimea as well. In Kyiv, on Constitution Square, the Walk of the Brave was opened today - a place to honor the personal strength of those people who did not fail after February 24, who were not afraid, who did not retreat under the pressure of tyranny. Who helped us fight against Russian aggression and is still helping us. And the first name that we presented on the Walk of the Brave is the name of Andrzej Duda, the President of Poland. He was in Kyiv today, participating in the Crimea Platform. And for not a single day during these six months has he lost strength in supporting Ukraine. I am grateful to him! I definitely want to address our Kharkiv and all Kharkiv residents separately today. You are heroic people, a heroic city. A proud city. A city with a sense of self-respect. A city that knows how to defend itself. A city whose people know how to unite. A neat city. A city that always impresses everyone who comes and sees how Kharkiv residents take care of their streets and yards even when they are under the brutal pressure of Russian terrorists. Today is Kharkiv Day. Now our Kharkiv is not willing to celebrate. Yes, Kharkiv experienced a lot of injustice and cruelty. But Kharkiv will never be a city of black scorched windows and ruined districts. Kharkiv will never submit to this evil, which has nothing but artillery and missiles. We will definitely liberate the entire Kharkiv region. We will find a way to guarantee security to our Kharkiv. And we will do everything to restore the city. I promise! Fellow Ukrainians! Tomorrow is an important day for all of us. And that is why this day, unfortunately, is also important for our enemy. We must be aware that tomorrow hideous Russian provocations and brutal strikes are possible. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence, special services will do everything to protect people - as much as possible. And we will certainly respond to any manifestation of Russian terror. But please follow the safety rules strictly tomorrow. Please observe the curfew. Pay attention to the air sirens. Pay attention to official announcements. And remember: we must all achieve victory together. Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "The free people of independent Ukraine! And that says it all. Just four words, but how much is behind them today. On the 182nd day of the full-scale war. How many symbols and meanings, feats and losses, joy and pain are in these words. And mainly how much truth is in them. Our truth. Truth about our present, with which it is impossible to argue, as it is impossible not to see and not to admit. We are the free people of independent Ukraine. After six months of the attempts to destroy us, we are the free people of independent Ukraine. And this is the truth about our future. The free people of independent Ukraine. Six months ago, Russia declared war against us. On February 24, the entire Ukraine heard explosions and gunshots. And on August 24, it wasn’t supposed to hear the words \"Happy Independence Day\". On February 24, we were told: you have no chance. On August 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine! During these six months, we changed history, changed the world and changed ourselves. Now we know for sure who is really our brother and friend, and who is not even a casual acquaintance. Who did not lose his name and reputation, and who worried for the terrorists to save face. Who doesn't really need us, and where the door is really open for us. We understood who is who. And the whole world learned who Ukrainians are. What Ukraine is. No one will say about it anymore: it is somewhere over there, near Russia. We started to respect ourselves. We understood that despite any help and support, no one but us will fight for our independence. And we united. We didn't have HIMARS yet, but we had people willing to stop tanks with their bare hands. They were not ready to close the sky for us, but we had people willing to cover their native land with themselves. The Ukrainian people and their courage inspired the whole world. They gave humanity a new hope that justice has not completely left our cynical world. And it is still not force that wins in it, but truth. Not money, but values. Not oil, but people. Yesterday the world was not united. COVID-19 clearly showed: it's every man for himself. Ukraine has changed this in six months. All world history textbooks will have a section \"Times when Ukraine united the world\". When democracy grew teeth again. When tyranny receives an answer in the language it understands. Someone said: Europe is no longer a player. Weak, disunited, passive, sleepy. Ukraine invigorated the whole continent. Europe takes to the squares. Europe introduces tough sanctions. Europe unanimously recognizes that Ukraine is a future member of the European Union. Big business realized that money still smells. With blood, cinder, death. Corporations and brands are leaving the Russian market, and people have become more important than potential losses. Never before in the world has public opinion had such an influence on politicians. Today, people dictate trends and rules of behavior to the authorities. Being indifferent, inactive and slow is a shame. Being indecisive and too cautious is a shame. Speaking sluggishly, vaguely and too diplomatically is a shame. Not supporting Ukraine is a shame. And saying about fatigue from Ukraine is a shame. This is a very comfortable position: fatigue is a cover to close your eyes. And today we hear from world leaders and ordinary citizens: we will be with you until the end, until your victory. Dear people! We always paid tribute to all the fighters for independence, called this day the main holiday, and the blue-yellow flag - a shrine, put our hands to our hearts while singing the national anthem, and proudly said \"Glory to Ukraine!\" and \"Glory to Heroes!\". On February 24, we had to prove our words with deeds. On this day, the second all-Ukrainian referendum actually took place. Again - the main question. Again - a decisive choice. But this time it was necessary to say \"yes\" to independence not in the ballot, but in the soul and conscience. Go not to the precinct, but to the military commissariat departments, the territorial defense units, the volunteer movement, the information troops or simply work steadily and conscientiously in your place, at full strength, for a common goal. We all changed. Someone was born again. As a person, individual, citizen, patriot, simply as a Ukrainian. And this, of course, is good news. Someone disappeared. Did not perish, did not die, but dissolved. As a person, individual, citizen, as a Ukrainian. And this is actually not bad news either. We will not hinder each other anymore. We made a choice. For some, it is Mariupol. For some - Monaco. But we know who the majority is. And we finally became truly one. A new nation that emerged on February 24 at 4 am. Not born, but reborn. A nation that didn't cry, didn't scream, didn't get scared. Didn't run away. Didn't give up. Didn't forget. This flag will be everywhere it should be by right. Both in Donbas and in Crimea. The enemy thought we would greet him with flowers and champagne. Instead, he received wreaths and Molotov cocktails. He was waiting for an ovation, but hears \"claps\". The occupier believed that in a few days he would be on parade in our capital’s downtown. Today, you can see this \"parade\" on Khreshchatyk. The proof that enemy equipment can appear in the center of Kyiv only in such form. Burnt, wrecked and destroyed. It doesn't matter to us what kind of army you have, what matters to us is our land. We will fight for it until the end. We are holding on for six months. It is difficult for us, but we clenched our fists fighting for our fate. Every new day is a new reason not to give up. Because, having gone through so much, we have no right not to reach the end. What is the end of the war for us? We used to say: peace. Now we say: victory. We will not seek an understanding with the terrorists. Although we understand the Russian language that you came to defend. And killed thousands of people you came to liberate. And Johnson, who speaks English, is much more understandable and close to us than murderers, rapists and looters who did it in Russian. And we don't sit down at the negotiating table because of fear, with a gun pointed at our head. For us, the most terrible iron is not missiles, aircraft and tanks, but shackles. Not trenches, but fetters. And we will put our hands up only once - when we will celebrate our victory. The whole of Ukraine. Because we do not trade our lands and our people. For us, Ukraine is all of Ukraine. All 25 regions, without any concessions or compromises. We do not know these words, they were destroyed by missiles on February 24. Donbas is Ukraine. And we will return it, whatever the path may be. Crimea is Ukraine. And we will return it. Whatever the path may be. You don't want your soldiers to die? Free our lands. You don't want your mothers to cry? Free our lands. These are our simple and clear terms. The free people of independent Ukraine! We are facing this day in different places. Someone is in trenches and dugouts, in tanks and IFVs, at sea and in the air. Fighting for independence on the frontline. Someone is on the road, in cars, trucks and trains. Fighting for independence by delivering what is necessary to those on the frontline. And someone is on a smartphone or on a computer. Also fighting for independence by raising funds so that those on the road have something to bring to those on the frontline. We are facing this day in different circumstances, conditions and even in different time zones, but with one goal - preservation of independence and victory of Ukraine! We united. Happy Independence Day of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I am thankful to everyone present for this opportunity, for your support! Greetings from independent and free Ukraine! But from Ukraine, which is still forced to fight for its freedom against Russian terror. Just now, on my way to deliver this address, I received information about a Russian missile attack on the Dnipropetrovsk region, on the railway station, directly on the cars at the Chaplyne station, four passenger cars are on fire... As of now, at least 15 people have been killed, about 50 have been wounded. Rescuers are working. But, unfortunately, the number of dead may still increase. This is how we live every day. This is how Russia prepared for this meeting of the UN Security Council. Ladies and Gentlemen! Mr. President! Mr. Secretary-General! Dear members of the UN Security Council - all those who respect and adhere to the UN Charter! Today, our state celebrates the main national holiday - Independence Day. And now you all see how many things in the world are dependent precisely on the independence of our state, on whether Ukraine is at peace, whether our people are safe, whether the integrity of our territory and the inviolability of our borders are guaranteed. You can take any aspect of the terrible war that Russia has unleashed against us, and in every such aspect there will be the roots of one global crisis or another. What exactly is happening now? Russia has put the world on the brink of a radiation disaster. It is a fact that the Russian military made the territory of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe - the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - a combat zone. This is a fact. Because of Russia's armed provocations, because of shelling, because of the deployment of terrorists under the Russian flag on the territory of the plant. Now all of Europe and all neighboring regions are under the threat of radiation pollution. This is a fact. Who among you has forgotten what Chornobyl is? The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant consists of six reactors. One reactor exploded in Chornobyl. The IAEA mission must take permanent control of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as soon as possible, and Russia must unconditionally stop nuclear blackmail and completely leave the plant. Russia has put the world on the brink of an unprecedented famine. It is a fact that the Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov has increased the deficit in the already destabilized food market. And this is against the background of the terrible climatic situation in different parts of the planet - you can take the drought in Europe alone, the largest in 500 years. Fortunately, we managed to achieve such conditions under which Russia was forced to accept the terms of the international community, and thanks to this, grain exports from three Ukrainian ports were restored. This already relieves part of the tension in the food market, but does not remove the threat completely. Only the full recovery of Ukrainian agricultural exports without any obstacles can be a guarantee that tens of millions of people around the world will have something to eat. And don't you resent the fact that even now, in the XXI century, we still have to fight to save tens of millions of people in different countries from artificial famine, precisely artificial famine, which was provoked by one state with its insane aggression? And this is also a fact. Ukrainians are outraged. The UN was not created to discuss in the XXI century something that should have long remained in the past. But, nevertheless, I am thankful to the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, and Türkiye, Mr. President, as well as all other conscientious subjects of international relations who are fighting against the food crisis, which only Russia is responsible for. And in the coming weeks, we must do everything to expand the existing grain export initiative. Let’s take another aspect - energy. It is a fact that Russia is deliberately trying to bring tens of millions of people into energy poverty. Deprive them of normal access to basic goods by deliberately raising energy prices. And this is done by a permanent member of the UN Security Council, who still has the privilege of veto! Energy crisis for Europe, threat of large-scale famine, political chaos for African and Asian countries, price crisis for the whole world. Isn’t too much allowed to one state, whose representative is sitting among you? And I will mention one more aspect - values. Yes, indeed, we should be honest about the fact that values are perceived differently in different parts of the world. They look at it differently. But everywhere in the world, life has value. Peace has value. Economic prosperity has value. All states, if they respect themselves and their people, punish murder and do not honor torturers. However, we see that there is a state that not just behaves differently, but that is proud to behave differently. It awards murderers, encourages torturers. And this is a threat not only for Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed by the Russian invaders. Dozens of our cities were destroyed by Russian artillery. Russia does not adhere to basic conventions regarding prisoners of war. This was also discussed today. The deliberate murder by the Russian occupiers of our prisoners of war in Olenivka became one of the most dreadful pages in the history of Europe. And there is an urgent need for a UN fact-finding mission to Olenivka, whose mandate should be extended to all Ukrainian prisoners of war currently held by Russian forces. There is no war crime that the Russian occupiers have not yet committed on the territory of our independent state. But if we do not stop Russia now in Ukraine, if we do not stop it with the victory of Ukraine, all these Russian murderers will inevitably end up in other countries. Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America - traces of Russian war criminals are everywhere already, and we must all unite and act as resolutely as possible so that there are no more traces of Russian missiles and cities burned by Russian artillery anywhere else. So that there is never again a threat of a radiation disaster, Russia must leave the occupied territory of Ukraine. So that there is never a food crisis again, Russia must leave our land and our sea. So that no country in the world can ever again disregard the UN Charter and conventions binding on all mankind, without exception for anyone - Russia must be held accountable for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. The relevant resolution will be submitted for consideration by the 77th session of the UN General Assembly. In order for a sense of justice to return to international relations, we must all confirm and force Russia to recognize that the inviolability of borders and peace are unconditional values for all nations. That is why the independence and integrity of our state are of fundamental importance for international relations. Preserving our independence, guaranteeing our security, returning normal economic ties with Ukraine will restore the true power of the UN Charter and save the world from the crises we are all forced to experience now. Mr. Secretary-General, Distinguished António Guterres, has the ambitious intention of organizing the Summit of the Future next year. We support this intention. And we emphasize: in order to build the future, it is necessary to leave in the trashbox of history what has always prevented humanity from living in peace, namely aggression and colonial ambitions. That is, what Russia came to Ukraine with. And I believe that we will really be able to build the future. It would be very nice and symbolic for such a Summit to take place in Ukraine. As it is on our territory, on the territory of Ukraine, that it is now being decided whether we will have a future at all, whether the world will have a future at all. This is being decided at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, in our seaports, in Donbas and in Crimea. Our independence is your security. The security of the entire free world. I thank you very much for this opportunity, for understanding my situation, the situation of our country. Thank you! I am grateful to the Chinese Presidency for the opportunity to participate in this meeting in an online format. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Fellow Ukrainians! It's almost night, our main day, Independence Day of Ukraine, is coming to an end. But our independence does not end and will never end. And there will be our 32nd Independence Day, and 33rd, and all the following ones, as long as time on earth lasts. Ukraine will live forever. And it will only get stronger every day. And absolutely everyone in the world understands this - from the UN Security Council to all capitals without exception. Therefore, let's not retreat from our path, let's fight, express gratitude to everyone who supports us, take care of our state, preserve our unity - the same unity as today, as every day over these six months. And no enemy will be able to defeat us. There are no such bombs that can erase freedom, and there will never be such missiles that can break the will of the people who believe in themselves. Chaplyne is our pain today. As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old teenager died, a Russian missile destroyed his house. Search and rescue operations at the railway station will continue. We will definitely make the occupiers bear responsibility for everything they have done. And we will certainly drive the invaders out of our land. Not a single stain of this evil will remain in our free Ukraine. We will make our way to victory! It will happen! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by these invaders, these enemies. Eternal glory to all our warriors! Glory to our people! Glory to our Ukrainian strong world, our independence, our nation! Glory to all of you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All Europeans! Today, for the first time in history, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant stopped. The emergency protection of the power units worked - after the last working line of the plant's power return to the Ukrainian power system was damaged by Russian shelling. Diesel generators were immediately activated to provide energy to the plant itself, to support it after the shutdown. The world must understand what a threat this is: if the diesel generators hadn’t turned on, if the automation and our staff of the plant had not reacted after the blackout, then we would already be forced to overcome the consequences of the radiation accident. Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster. The south of Ukraine - the occupied areas - is already in a state of humanitarian disaster. In addition to all the evil that the occupiers brought there, electricity, water and sewage were cut off. Russia has brought degradation to our land, which has never been seen here. All this was simply impossible before the occupation. But this is the essence and pride of the modern Russian state: it is capable of only one thing - making the worst possible. I want to assure all Ukrainians: we are doing everything to prevent an emergency scenario. But it depends not only on our state. The key thing is that such international pressure is needed that will force the occupiers to immediately withdraw from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The IAEA and other international organizations must act much faster than they’re acting now. Because every minute the Russian troops stay at the nuclear power plant is a risk of a global radiation disaster. Of course, we are doing everything so that the world knows every detail of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. And, in particular, today I talked about it in detail with President of the United States of America Biden. I am grateful to him for understanding and fully supporting the need to return the plant under the Ukrainian control and provide for the IAEA access immediately. This can be done in a matter of days, before the occupiers bring the situation to an irreversible point. And it's easier to do it now than later, if the wind starts blowing radiation pollution across Europe. In general, our conversation with President Biden today was very constructive, positive, quite long and productive. We managed to discuss all issues that are of vital importance for the protection of Ukraine and freedom. I thanked Mr. President and all the people of the United States for the defense assistance and for the tangible leadership in the macro-financial support of our state. Just yesterday, President Biden approved a $6 billion package: three for defense assistance, three for financial assistance through the World Bank system. I expressed particular gratitude for the inclusion of air defense in this package. We can really achieve a situation when the Russian missile terror will be overcome after Ukraine receives NASAMS air defense systems. Today, I also had a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy who was on a visit to Ukraine. I thanked the Italian people, the President of Italy and personally Prime Minister of Italy Draghi for his principles in the defense of a united Europe. Mr. Draghi became one of those European leaders whose determination and personal morality made it possible at a critical moment to strengthen Europe and protect normal life on our continent. We discussed today the expansion of cooperation between our states and Italy's experience in strengthening security, in particular energy security. By the way, due to Russian gas blackmail, gas prices in Europe today have already exceeded the level of $3,300 per thousand cubic meters. And this Russian anti-European policy is truly destructive, but in a strategic perspective – for Russia itself. There will no longer be such a player on the European energy market as Russia. Of course, now the situation is very dangerous, very acute. But most European countries have approached energy issues very responsibly and are doing everything to adapt, to protect themselves. If someone in Russia thinks that they will bring Europe as a whole or Ukraine or other individual countries to their knees this winter, then this is a miscalculation. I believe that Europe is strong enough to correct the mistakes of the past, to become independent from the Russian energy system, from Russian energy carriers and not to give in to the blackmail of energy terrorists from Gazprom. Ukraine is closely coordinating actions with its partners in these issues as well - in energy issues. The Government of Ukraine, our state-owned companies are doing everything to ensure that we are ready to go through this winter season, which will indeed be the most difficult in our history. And we are now in such circumstances, when it is already clear that the enemy will not achieve its goals, but it still takes time, efforts are still needed for the Russian calculation to fail, so that they lose in this direction as well. We have to endure this time and make all the necessary efforts together with our partners. And so it will be. We will put pressure on terrorists on all fronts - on the frontline, on the political front, in economic matters, in the information sphere. For every shelling, there will be a response to the occupiers. It will be for Orikhiv. It will be for Chaplyne. It will be for Shepetivka, for Myrhorod, for Kharkiv, for Mariupol and the cities of Donbas, for all others who are targeted by the Russian military. Russia has prepared many problems, crises and catastrophes for our country, for Europe and for the world. But the greatest disaster will still be experienced by it itself, the terrorist state itself. This \"Titanic\" came to its iceberg on February 24, and no matter how hard they try to stay afloat, they won’t. Eternal glory to all who fight for freedom! Eternal glory to all our warriors! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good evening, Ukrainians! Europeans! Our nuclear scientists, all specialists in the energy industry, manage to protect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the worst-case scenario, which is constantly being provoked by Russian forces. Currently, the plant has been connected to the grid. My congratulations. It produces power for Ukraine. I want to emphasize that the situation remains very risky and dangerous. Any repeat of yesterday's events, that is, any disconnection of the plant from the grid, any actions by Russia that could trigger the shutdown of the reactors, will again put the plant one step away from disaster. That is why it is so important that the IAEA mission arrives at the plant as soon as possible and helps keep the NPP under continuous control of Ukraine. That is why it is so important that Russian troops withdraw from the plant and neighboring areas and that the threat of shelling of the plant itself or power lines connected to it disappears. Ukrainian diplomats and our partners continue to fight for the safety of the Zaporizhzhia NPP every day. And today I want to thank all those who are mobilizing the world's response to Russian radiation blackmail. To all our nuclear scientists – you are great, you are cool! To all our engineers – you are strong – whose professionalism is now literally saving both Ukraine and Europe when they overcome the consequences of Russian terror at the plant! Today, we can draw the first conclusions about the rescue of many countries and peoples from the food crisis, which Russia wanted so badly to exacerbate into real famine. The grain export initiative has been operating for almost a month, and during this time, the first million tonnes of foodstuffs were exported from our three seaports in Chornomorsk, Odesa and Yuzhne since February 24. This is a victory. This means in practice that Ukrainian grain and the very fact that the Ukrainian supply route to the world food market has worked, make it possible to prevent chaos on the market, reduce the severity of the food crisis and prevent a catastrophic shortage. Ukraine was, is and will be among the guarantors of global food security. By the way, 44 vessels with Ukrainian foodstuffs have already been sent to 15 countries of the world, we have 70 more applications for the arrival of vessels at ports for loading. The goal is to reach the volume of 3 million tonnes of export by sea every month. And this is extremely important for Africa, Asia and Europe. It is also important that our society realizes that this export not only supports the international subject status of Ukraine, but also provides jobs for our citizens – it is hundreds of thousands of jobs, it provides income for Ukrainian companies, for our budget and, what is very important, it provides funds for planting next year. I still remember the joy of port workers in Odesa, when they not only learned, but actually saw that the port had resumed operations. This is a really important result for Ukraine, for the Black Sea region and for the whole world. And I am grateful to everyone who joined this work, this initiative. I emphasize that it is the full responsibility of the partners to prevent any Russian provocations and disruption of exports. We continue mobilizing media support for Ukraine. Now it is time that we need to look for even more non-standard channels for spreading the truth about Russia's war against you and us, about our independence, about the needs of our state. We constantly find new information friends – real friends – partners in the defense of freedom and in countering Russian disinformation. Yes, today I spoke with Jimmy Fallon – a very famous American talk show host, actor – about options for how to draw attention to Ukraine, how to convey the truth to the United States, to the people. How can we still help Ukraine? It was his main question. The question is how to win in this information war against the lies of the Russian Federation. The situation on the front line remains unchanged these days. Our soldiers are doing everything possible to reduce the firepower and logistical potential of the occupiers. I think you all see the relevant news – about the destruction of the bases of the occupiers, their warehouses, those river crossings that they use. And the more successful we will be in this – our intelligence, our army, the Security Service of Ukraine – the sooner we will be able to change the situation at the front in our favor. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, all our people, prove to the Russian occupiers every day that they do not have and will not have a chance to stay safe on Ukrainian land. The day will come when the occupiers will admit it. Or there simply won't be any left. Eternal glory to all of you, defenders of our state! Eternal glory to our strong, indomitable, wise, beautiful people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health! Today is Aviation Day. It is traditionally celebrated in our country on the last Saturday of August. It is a professional holiday of people without whom the present cannot be imagined. And without which we cannot imagine the independence of our state. Russia hoped to destroy our aircraft in the first hours of the full-scale invasion. And, of course, this enemy had a completely insane goal, like many other such goals. The Air Force of Ukraine was preserved, and since the first day of the invasion, it has been honorably performing combat missions. In six months, 18 pilots were honored with the title of Hero of Ukraine. Dozens more have been given state awards. Their skills and combat results have become a true legend, and I have repeatedly heard the highest praise of our aviation from representatives of the armies and states of our partners. Ukrainian aviation is strong. It will be among the most modern, that's for sure. This cannot be changed. But even in the extremely difficult conditions that exist now, Ukrainian pilots show the greatest skills. Today I thank all our pilots, everyone who services flights, prepares equipment for flights, and everyone who helps Ukrainian military aviation to be able to perform combat missions. And separately, I want to thank the parents of our soldiers, mothers and fathers of Ukrainian pilots, for such brave and intelligent sons who did and are doing a lot to bring our victory – the victory of Ukraine – closer. Once again – Happy Aviation Day of Ukraine! This week, for the Independence Day of our country, I signed a number of decrees on awarding representatives of various professions, various groups of our society. In general, those who really helped the defense of Ukraine, the defense of independence, our people, and who are really known at the front. I asked the military and law enforcement officers, all authorities – central and regional, ministries and regional administrations, as well as representatives of the media – to provide me with nominations of those who deserve awards. Those in the trenches, those who support our boys and girls. Name the people they know in the army, whom they are truly grateful to on the front lines. Who support the fighting spirit of Ukrainians, our faith in ourselves, who spread the truth about the war. Who are mobilizing assistance for Ukraine abroad. Who support the displaced people... Volunteers and officials, journalists and workers of utility service enterprises, communications operators, transport workers and athletes, artists, musicians, public figures, workers of the energy industry, post office... Many different people whose candidacies were proposed. There are also those who are awarded, unfortunately, posthumously. Of course, I also signed decrees on awarding our soldiers – in the Armed Forces, in intelligence, in the Security Service of Ukraine. In total, since February 24, 27,760 of our defenders have been given state awards of Ukraine. Tomorrow, on Sunday, these decrees will be made public. And there will be another decree – a very important, special decree – on awarding state awards to friends of Ukraine abroad, our partners, our helpers in the struggle for freedom and life. Those whose contribution is really significant. Those to whom Ukraine will always be grateful. Because the struggle for independence is the struggle of the entire nation, and only in this way it can be successful. It is nationwide here in Ukraine. And that is why Ukraine will win. The people always win. And the successful struggle for freedom in the world also cannot be the struggle of only individual people or individual states. It is a joint work, a common result, which is achieved thanks to the strength and solidarity of all who value freedom and who do not tolerate tyranny. Freedom always wins. We will definitely win! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal gratitude to everyone who helps fight for freedom, for our state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Every year, on the last weekend of summer, two holidays were celebrated in our country – they are closely related – Donetsk City Day and Miner's Day. In 2014, everything changed for Donetsk because of the occupiers. And this year, all of Ukraine will not have holidays. But we have not forgotten and will not forget any of our cities and any of our people. Donetsk has always been one of the richest and strongest cities in Ukraine. Mining has always been one of the most respected professions. Now Donbas is almost destroyed by Russian strikes, devastated. The proud and glorious Ukrainian Donetsk was humiliated by the Russian occupation and robbed. Russia brought the most terrible thing there – absolute disregard for the value of any life, absolute disrespect for anyone. The invaders brought degradation and death. And they believe that they are there forever. But it's a temporary thing for them. And Ukraine will return. For sure. Life will return. The dignity of the people of Donbas will return. The ability to live will return. The opportunity to live safely and happily. This is exactly what our Ukrainian flag will symbolize when we set it up in Donetsk, Horlivka, Mariupol, in all cities of Donbas, Azov area, in all areas under Russian occupation – in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson regions. And definitely – in Crimea. Ukraine remembers everything. I held a meeting today with representatives of the defense and security sector. It was attended by the heads of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other structures and areas of defense of our state. All the issues we considered are important, but secret, I cannot go into detail. But the occupiers will feel its consequences – in the further actions of our defenders. No terrorist will go unanswered for attacks on our cities. Zaporizhzhia, Orikhiv, Kharkiv, Donbas – they will receive an answer for all of them. We are preparing for a new week – it will be very active. Important visits of partners to Ukraine are planned. I will resume the practice of appeals to the states and nations that support us. And most importantly, we are working to ensure that there are new restrictions for Russia because of the war and that there are new support packages for our defenders, for our state. Defense support – weapons and ammunition, financial support, political support, media support, support for our reconstruction – every day every public official must demonstrate results in his area of responsibility. Only work for results gives the right to hold public positions. This should be remembered by everyone who was given power. Thank you to everyone who honestly works for the state! Thanks to all our defenders! Glory to our soldiers! Glory to our people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Your Royal Highness, Mr. Prime Minister! Dear businessmen present! Dear Mr. Elon Musk! Dear friends! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful to each and every one of you who is present for the opportunity to talk and for the opportunity to participate in this important discussion. I'm sure you are well informed about the situation in Europe, about the risks - I heard you talked about them now - that we all face now in addition to the brutal terrorist war that Russia is waging against our citizens, our state, against our independence. And it is important to know that this is the independence of all other European states. This is a war for independence as such. We all see how destabilized the gas market is. We all see how European countries are revising their plans for coal, coal-fired power plants. We can all see that the threat of energy poverty is becoming real for tens of millions of people in Europe, who until recently could afford normal energy consumption. We all see that the price of energy is so high that thousands of businesses have gone into crisis. And this leads to a reduction in jobs and a drop in workers' incomes. And in winter, energy prices can rise even more... We all see that for the first time since 1986, when the Chornobyl tragedy occurred, we have to consider as seriously as possible the scenarios for countering the radiation disaster that Russia is bringing closer with its terror at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. These are all well-known facts. But what do they testify to? People often draw completely different conclusions from the same facts - some are right, and some are wrong. In the discussions, the opinion of the majority is determined afterwards - either right or wrong. Sometimes mistakes leave no trace. And sometimes the price of mistakes becomes very high, when erroneous conclusions lead to erroneous political decisions. This is what the authors of this large-scale – and completely artificial – crisis that Europe is going through are counting on. They want the Europeans to be scared. To draw wrong conclusions and give up European values in favor of illusory price reductions. Russia is using economic terror, price crisis pressure and poverty to weaken Europe just when its full force is needed to defend against terror in the war that Russia has been waging for more than six months. Full-scale war! And in general, its invasion of Ukraine has already been lasting for 8 years. This is what the Russian state, its officials and companies, such as Gazprom, are working for. For creating crises and for crises to turn into disasters. Right now, Russia is burning at least 10 million euros worth of gas near the Finnish border every day. Gas is being burned that should have been supplied to German and other European consumers. Russia cannot stop its production, does not want to supply it to the Europeans, as it is interested in the crisis, and has no other buyers. So it just burns this gas. Just like they burn our people. 10 million euros on fire every day at the border of Russia is hundreds of millions of euros in additional expenses of the European middle class, ordinary workers, pensioners on energy every day as well. Because of the inflated prices on the market, because of the shortage, because of Russia trying to prevent the replenishment of European gas storages before winter. A normal market player would have already supplied the free volume of gas to the market. The terrorist state does everything to ensure that there is as little gas as possible on the market at the highest possible price, which leads to an increase in other prices. And this is all part of the Russian hybrid aggression against all people, against all of us, against all of you, against all of united Europe. And take a look at the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Why is Russia doing this? What is the purpose of the radiation blackmail for Russia? The goal is the same, completely cynical, completely deliberate - to intimidate Ukrainians, to intimidate all Europeans. To blackmail and coerce. This pressure is for Russian state propagandists and officials to say that it is allegedly not Russia to blame, that someone else created another crisis and that this someone should be influenced, and that it is allegedly necessary to negotiate with the Kremlin precisely for this reason. Just think about it: Russia is the only terrorist in the world who managed to turn a nuclear power plant into a battlefield and who consistently does everything to make Europe watch where the wind may blow the radiation if, God forbid, a disaster occurs. Most of the older generation of Norway, I think, well remember that the consequences of the accident at the Chornobyl plant were felt even in central Norway - in the area of Trondheim and in the north of your country. And for all of us, this is a terrible risk. This is a memory of the unacceptable, and for Russia it is just an additional opportunity. The fact is that the Russian leadership has a specific bandit’s logic - they create problems, hoping that the victims of these problems will come and try to agree on their solution, and the bandit will get something for it. Russia wants Europe to turn a blind eye to the war, and for this purpose it is provoking internal chaos in Europe. Russia wants to take away freedom from us by force of arms, and from you - by these crises that it creates and exacerbates. Russia wants to force you to abandon European values. Here is a correct conclusion from the available facts. And based on this conclusion, a correct policy is needed. The policy of even greater unity, as the Prime Minister has said now, unity in Europe for our common defense. The policy of even greater energy independence of Europe from Russia. The policy of even greater sanctions against Russia. It is not normal when there are still no blocking sanctions against Rosatom for radiation blackmail at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, for which specific Rosatom employees at the plant are also responsible. And it is not normal when any Russian citizen can get a visa to European countries to go on vacation or go shopping - we know this very well - even if he is a war criminal or helps the Russian state work against Europe. It is not normal when some European companies are still hesitant whether to leave the Russian market or not. And it is not normal when someone still hopes for cooperation with Russia in the energy sector. There can be no concessions to bandits! Only new sanction strikes against them. I want to give an example of Norway - an example of true principles in the defense of Europe. Despite the fact that Norway is not a member of the European Union, you joined the European sanctions against Russia. Defense and other assistance to our country from Norway is vital - we will always be grateful for it. We are glad to hear that your energy companies are increasing the volume of gas supplies to European countries, while Russia is willing to simply burn gas in order not to supply it. And we note Norway's contribution to the development of renewable energy sources, to carbon capture and storage, to the development of batteries and hydrogen energy. Europe will become truly strong and secure from crises when all European countries become as principled as Norway. For its part, Ukraine can already do - and is doing - concrete things to protect our common values and normal life on the continent. We are fighting for freedom and for everything that Europe is based on, defending all Europeans in this war. And this is not pathos - this is the truth! We have united Europeans and helped overcome the various contradictions that have been dividing the continent for decades. We have shown what power Europe has when united and what enemies it can overcome. In addition, Ukraine can become - I believe it will become - one of the guarantors of the energy security of the European continent. Together with Ukraine, you will be able to prevent such price crises ever again. We have a unique system of gas storage facilities near the border of the European Union, with a volume of more than 30 billion cubic meters. We are asked about help. That's how practical it is - use our gas storages already this season. Today, for example, we have a free volume of 15 billion cubic meters. Ukraine needs 3 billion of additional reserves, which we ask you to keep in Ukraine, and another 12 billion cubic meters may be the gas needed in winter for the security of all of Europe. You can help us - and this will be your help both to us and to yourself. Ukraine also has significant deposits of natural gas. The leadership of Russia dreamed of stealing this part of our national wealth from us as well. But we will not allow it. We invite all investors, contractors and service companies to join gas production in Ukraine. If you want to help us pragmatically, please use this tool. Obtain licenses, enter into agreements on the distribution of products, carry out exploration and drilling. We would appreciate it. Our gas fields can play the same stabilizing role for Europe as the fields of Norway in particular. We are preparing to increase the export of our electricity to the countries of the European Union - despite the war, during the war we ensure this export, and our electricity is much cheaper than what is currently available on the market. We can really help overcome the cost of living crisis in our neighboring EU countries. And we invite you to invest in the production of green energy and green hydrogen in Ukraine. Our state is one of the best locations for providing all of Europe with green energy and green hydrogen. We have everything for this – enough land, good wind, good sun, as well as ready-made energy logistics – powerful power transmission lines, gas pipelines that can be used for hydrogen – of course, after appropriate modernization. We are not saying for the first time that Europe's independence from Russia, particularly in energy, is of fundamental importance to all Europeans. And we are not saying for the first time that Europe can do much more together with Ukraine than with Russia. We don't want to look into the past, we don't want to repeat who didn't hear us. Ukraine wants us all not to lose the opportunities we have at this historical moment. Only together can we protect Europe. Only by preserving our maximum principles. And only by achieving victory in this war together. I thank you for your attention! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President of the MEDEF! Dear ministers, dear MEDEF members! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful to you for the invitation, for this opportunity to address you, to address in your person the entire people of France - each and every one who believes that no one has the right to destroy someone's life. I know that MEDEF unites and protects the interests of hundreds of thousands of businesses in France. You represent people who have created and who are developing businesses in different areas, completely different industries. You represent people who work hard to be able to provide for their children and exercise their rights. The right to live, the right to be free, the right to happiness, the right to well-being, the right to housing, the right to education, the right to work, the right to a decent wage and other absolutely common modern human rights. And in fact, your association represents the very people that I, as the President of Ukraine, represent. Our people wanted nothing more than to live in their own country, enjoy their freedoms, work for their own good and the future of their children. Ukraine did not go to someone else’s home with weapons. Ukrainians were not going to rob any other people or any state. We cared about our social development, our democracy and dreamed that one day we would be in the European Union together with you and other nations of Europe. And that is why this Russian war against Ukraine began. The leadership of Russia saw that Ukraine can become and is becoming a positive example for our region. An example that democracy can give more to society than dictatorship can. This seems to be an obvious opinion in Western Europe, but in the east of our continent, and especially in the territory of the former USSR, this is not an obvious fact, it needs to be proved. And Ukraine did everything to prove it. Our state set an example of how to take care of society without crazy dollars and euros earned from the sale of oil and gas. How to create opportunities for social development. How to strengthen the regions of the state, not drain money from them. How to build modern infrastructure. How to create such opportunities for citizens that others in our region simply do not have thanks to the openness of society and the modernity of state institutions. In particular, we conducted and continue to digitize public services. Our goal is to ensure that relations between a citizen and the state, between any company and the state take place without the mediation of a government official. This is a necessary condition for overcoming any risks of corruption and for the real freedom of people and business - something that dozens of other governments cannot dare to do. And this is something that every Ukrainian has in his smartphone today. This is \"Diia\" state service, which gives people dozens of different opportunities: from digital documents and vaccination certificates to the ability to register a business or pay fines. We combine our economy and energy sphere with the European market and other advanced world markets. We have deposits of natural resources that are critically important for the world economy, including lithium, titanium, uranium, etc. Ukraine has already become a guarantor of global food security. The value of our agrarian exports was fully demonstrated when Russia blocked Ukrainian ports, and as a result, the global food crisis aggravated. Russia's war against Ukraine is not just a colonial war in the worst sense of the word, it is not just an attempt to appropriate our land, resources or the potential of our people. Through the destruction of Ukraine, Russia is trying to destroy the hope of all nations near its borders and all peoples in the territory of Russia itself that freedom will really work. That democracy will help with development. That human rights and human dignity can give society more than the mercy of some dictator. That is why the Russian war against Ukraine is so brutal. That is why it became total from the first minute on February 24. That is why Russian cruise missiles and artillery destroy everything from day one. Everything that was built and developed by generations of Ukrainians. Schools and hospitals, universities, railway stations, airports, residential buildings of ordinary people, factories, bakeries, port facilities and even ordinary tire repair stations, ordinary shopping malls, machine-building plants, water plants, power plants - absolutely everything. Dropping a bomb on a maternity hospital, a theater or a warehouse with food is all the same to the Russian occupiers. All these are the same targets for them. Burning cities and making millions of people forcibly displaced are just tools for them. Because Russia's goal is to destroy Ukraine as a democracy, a social state, an economic power, a society of educated people who know how to work for their own interests. Like all people. But that is why I believe in our victory. When someone is at war with an entire nation, he has no chance. For us, this is a people's war. And nations are invincible! And when the nation has such friends like the Ukrainians have, victory becomes inevitable. I am sincerely grateful to you, the people of France, and I am personally grateful to President Emmanuel Macron for support in this fight for freedom. I saw how Emmanuel was looking for a diplomatic way, looking for steps to stop the war. I have devoted several years as president to finding a solution, a peaceful, diplomatic model of coexistence without war. But, unfortunately, the leadership of Russia does not want to live without war. The leadership of Russia considers the free and democratic life of Ukraine as an existential challenge for itself. That is why they want war and destruction. They think that this way they can secure their dictatorship for many years. And that is why it is important to achieve victory. It is important to do everything so that the victory takes place as soon as possible. It is important to do everything so that Russia can never again blackmail either Ukraine or France. You don't feel it as much as we do yet. And hopefully the war will not come to your land, but this is it. All this is their plan. Neither any European state, nor Europe in general can be blackmailed with a war, an energy crisis or a food crisis. It is important to rebuild Ukraine after the war. Peace for Ukraine, guarantees of security, restoration of everything destroyed by the Russian occupiers will be clear proof that the European idea is stronger than any dictatorships, and the values of freedom, equality and mutual aid overcome any terror. And that is why I am addressing you today. Ukraine can give you thousands of contracts, thousands of jobs. We need your experience and your participation in post-war reconstruction. We have already started - on the free territory of our country. We invite construction companies to take part in infrastructure reconstruction, localization of production of construction materials. We invite companies that can help in the modernization of communal infrastructure - water supply, water purification, waste sorting and processing. We invite energy companies to produce and store gas, build green energy, produce hydrogen and develop our nuclear energy industry. We invite automotive companies to localize the production of electric cars and components. We invite food companies to engage in agro-processing and food production for the 40-million market of Ukraine and the entire European market with which we are fully integrated. And we will come to the entire territory of our country currently occupied by Russia in order to return this territory to Europe. Perhaps some of you already know that at the level of our Governments - Ukraine and France - we are preparing to hold such an initiative in Paris in the autumn - a forum on the recovery of Ukraine. I invite your companies to participate in this initiative. I know that there are companies that have already responded and are participating in the reconstruction of our state. In particular, I am grateful to Matière company for its support in the restoration of our bridge infrastructure. I would also like to thank the Île-de-France region for starting a partnership with the Chernihiv and Kyiv regions, and the Grand-Est region for a partnership with the Kharkiv region. And I am also grateful to all other small and large cities of France, which came to the aid of Ukraine in this important, cruel time. I remember how last year, even before the start of the full-scale war, we met in Kyiv with the MEDEF delegation. Good ideas and ambitious projects were discussed. I want to confirm - we will be able to implement them, we will be able to do a lot together. Because we equally value freedom, equally respect human rights, equally care about social development. We are all people, we are all Europeans, and that says it all! Thank you for your attention! Thanks, France, for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear participants of the Forum! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and everyone present, as well as all Europeans! Today is an important day for us - the Day of Remembrance of the Defenders of Ukraine who died in the struggle for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. At this time, in August 2014, Ukrainian warriors were vilely killed near the city of Ilovaisk in Donbas. They were brutally shot by Russian troops. Ukraine lost hundreds of its sons then - in a few days. Hundreds of those thousands perished in the war since 2014. In the war that reached the scale of a total war on February 24 of this year. Russia's full-scale war against the life and freedom of our people, against ordinary peaceful cities that are being destroyed by Russian artillery, and against the culture of our people, which Russia wants to completely erase - Russian propagandists and officials do not even conceal this goal, they say absolutely openly that they want to destroy everything Ukrainian. So that it does not exist. They do not perceive the very fact of the independent existence of our people. Like any of your people. As we repel Russian aggression on our soil, we protect every European people from exactly the same expansion - the expansion of those who have nothing human left in them. Is there any human in someone who rapes children in front of their parents? In the one who forces the inhabitants of the entire village - everyone from small children to the elderly - to sit in the basement of the school for a month? Is there any human in someone who strikes heavy anti-ship missiles, which were built to destroy aircraft carriers, at an ordinary shopping mall full of people. In the one who supplies shells to the artillery, which day after day burns city blocks, ordinary residential buildings. In the one who interrogates and tortures people in the so-called filtration camps created by Russian forces throughout the occupied territory. Imagine: XXI century, filtration camps. Is there any human in someone who separates Ukrainian children from their parents and gives them for criminal adoption in Russia knowing that these children have relatives in Ukraine. Relatives who are alive and who are looking for them. When we talk about Russian aggression against Ukraine and all of Russia's pressure on Europe accompanying this aggression - and this is very cynical pressure, this is the deliberate destruction of normal economic and social life, this is the energy and price crises in Europe, which are artificially exacerbated by Russia - when we talk about all this, we mean not only those who are at the highest levels of the Russian power hierarchy. We are talking about thousands and thousands of different people with the passport of a Russian citizen. About those who shoot at our soldiers on the battlefield and shoot civilians in the back of the head. We are talking about those who press the buttons to strike Russian missiles at Ukrainian cities. About those who design and manufacture these missiles and other weapons used for terror. Those who work in companies that provide for the Russian army and special services. Those who conscript, transport and in every way support Russian murderers. We are talking about those who provide for corrupt Russian officials and generals, who manage numerous businesses that are related to corrupt Russian officials. Those who sow hatred for any manifestation of freedom, promote war, support repression. Those who remain silent when they see all this and do nothing - do not protest, do not fight - even when they are completely safe in European countries. Russia's war against Ukraine has been ongoing since 2014. For more than six months, the Russian state has been spending all its available resources to destroy our state and split Europe. Most European countries have already seen and experienced one or another of Russia's attempts to put pressure, inflict damage and bring suffering to people. And according to the logic of any normal person, it is the citizens of Russia who have something human left in them who should be the first to oppose the war. If they have conscience, if they have shame. But we do not see constant and noticeable anti-war protests with the participation of citizens of this state - even where there is no risk for them of any repression for protests, I repeat this once again. Why so? I'll leave you with that question. It is complicated - so why is it so? Europe is not a quiet haven where you can just sit out the time when someone else is fighting against Russian terror. But, unfortunately, many citizens of Russia perceive Europe this way. That is why they need European visas. And, unfortunately, none of your states is immune from the fact that war criminals, on whose hands there is the blood of Ukrainians, will come to you simply as tourists, and one day they will receive an order - and they will become not tourists at all. It shouldn't be like that. And all of us in Europe have to protect ourselves from this. Both those who are part of the European Union and all other European countries. Because Russian terror is an equal threat to all of us, to all who live here, to all European nations. The one who does not fight against terror supports it, and therefore shares the responsibility for all its consequences. This should be the rule that overrides all other rules. A state that threatens everyone around it - from the Baltic states to Kazakhstan - should be under a full embargo from everyone in the world who values freedom and respects themselves. We need an embargo on all relations with Russia, with a terrorist state, as long as Russia continues the war, occupies foreign territory, destroys the lives of other nations. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine is paying the most terrible price for freedom and for the ideals we share with you. Thousands of people died. Dozens of cities and villages were destroyed, now they are black ruins that look through burned windows at Russia and whether the world is able to stop it and bring it to account for everything done against peaceful people. Millions of Ukrainians were forced to leave their native places fleeing hostilities. And we can’t stand seeing how someone under the flag of the occupiers humiliates our people in some European cities sometimes. We can't stand seeing how thousands of those responsible for this war smile cynically, hoping that Russia will succeed in breaking Europe and returning to, as they call it, business as usual. And hundreds of millions of people throughout the free world can’t stand seeing it either. Hence, we need to act now so that our shared freedom is protected for generations to come. The stability and free development of Eastern Europe, the Balkans and all other parts of our continent of values, our continent of freedom must be protected and guaranteed. And that means very specific things. Sufficient defense support for Ukraine, support with weapons, shells, so that this war does not drag on, so that victory is achieved as soon as possible. Sufficient sanction pressure on Russia - to destroy the illusion of the Russian leadership that they will be able withstand the struggle against the free world. Sufficient protection of Europe itself - our people, our markets from Russia's hybrid aggression, which is betting on the spread of crises and poverty as much as it is betting on weapons. This also means our close coordination in strengthening our association, in the integration processes in Europe, in security cooperation between our states. A stronger Ukraine means a stronger Europe. A stronger Balkans means a stronger Europe. We must continue to help each other on the European path, as we are doing now. And it is imperative that the entire European Union, all European countries and the entire free world encourage Russian citizens to fight for a change in Russian state policy, encourage them not to remain silent and not to be complicit in terror. You know what to do. I am grateful to everyone who is already helping Ukraine. By helping us, you gave not excess, but what really matters to you. We appreciate it. We know that when we are fighting, when all of us are fighting together against this aggression, we are not just fighting for ourselves, but for Europe to win. The real struggle of each country for independence is a difficult path, it is what generations gain. And now we have the opportunity to achieve victory for ourselves, for our children, for our grandchildren, for all generations of our nations who fought for freedom earlier. I am sure we will win. We will win together. And this will be done in the name of Europe, in the name of all those who gave their lives for freedom. I thank you for your support! I thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today we honored the memory of our warriors who gave their lives for our state, for our independence. This day of remembrance is set for the end of summer, August 29, to remind everyone about the tragic events of 2014, about Ilovaisk, about the fact that this war, which began with Russia's occupation of our Crimea, with an attempt to seize Donbas, must end precisely there - in the liberated Crimea, in the liberated cities of Donbas, with our troops reaching the state border of Ukraine. We have always kept this goal in mind. We do not forget about it. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence, our defense forces are doing their job. I am sure that you all understand what is happening, what we are fighting for and what we are striving for. And our warriors do not need any announcements or information waves in the back. Ukraine is returning its own. And it will return the Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, Donetsk region, Zaporizhzhia region, Kherson region, Crimea, definitely our entire water area of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov - from Zmiinyi Island to the Kerch Strait. This will happen. This is ours. And just as our society understands it, I want the occupiers to understand it, too. There will be no place for them on Ukrainian land. Anyone want to know what our plans are? You won't hear specifics from any truly responsible person. Because this is war. And this is what it is during the war. But the occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed. The invaders know it well. If they want to survive, it is time for the Russian military to flee. Go home. If you are afraid to return to your home in Russia - well, let such occupiers surrender, and we will guarantee them compliance with all norms of the Geneva Conventions. If they do not listen to me, they will deal with our defenders, who will not stop until they liberate everything that belongs to Ukraine. And it is not something special. It's not something that supposedly started. We've been talking about it for 187 days. Today, I held meetings with the military, with representatives of the military-industrial sector, and with government officials. Important meetings, important topics, it is wrong to reveal them. But everyone can see the result over time. When our defenders destroy the logistics, bases, and headquarters of the enemy. We will continue this. I’ve made three appeals to foreign partners today. The first is Norway. I took part in the work of the energy forum, and I would like to thank the Prime Minister of Norway, Mr. Støre, for the new support package for Ukraine - about 200 million dollars as part of the energy preparation for winter. The second is France. A powerful association of entrepreneurs - hundreds of thousands of businessmen, millions of owners, managers and employees. I am grateful to them for their support and understanding of what we are fighting for in Ukraine, understanding that this struggle is shared by all Europeans. The third appeal is to the participants of the security forum in Slovenia, in particular, to our friends - the leaders of the countries of Central Europe and the Balkans. In the evening, I signed a decree awarding our warriors. 141 combatants were awarded state awards, ten of them posthumously. It is very important - today I had the honor to present the Gold Star Orders to the relatives, families of Heroes perished while performing combat missions. Eternal memory to all our heroes! Eternal glory to all those who fight for freedom for our entire land! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today, the Verkhovna Rada worked quite effectively and, in particular, endorsed several important laws and ratifications that bring us closer to the European Union. No matter how difficult it is - even in the conditions of such a war - we are moving step by step towards full membership in the EU. I have just signed these documents - on accession to the Convention on the Simplification of Formalities in Trade in Goods and to the Convention on the Common Transit Procedure. They are the actual implementation of the customs visa-free regime. We did it in record time and in a completely coordinated manner - all branches of government. And I want to thank all our diplomats, government officials, deputies who ensured this result. Ukraine will be a full member of the EU - and we are already closer to Europe than at any time in previous decades. Representatives of the IAEA have already arrived in our country and are to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It's an important mission, and we're doing everything we can for it to be safe and work at full capacity. Unfortunately, Russia does not stop provocations precisely in those directions from which the mission is supposed to arrive at the station. But I hope that the IAEA mission will be able to start its work. The situation at the ZNPP and in Enerhodar, in the surrounding areas, remains extremely threatening. The occupiers do not leave the plant, continue shelling and do not take away their weapons and ammunition from the territory of the NPP. They intimidate our plant’s staff. The risk of a radiation disaster due to Russian actions does not decrease for a single hour. Tonight I spoke about it with President of France Emmanuel Macron. We coordinated our positions in protecting Ukraine and Europe from Russian radiation blackmail. In the afternoon, I discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and the dispatch of the mission to the plant with IAEA Director General Grossi. I hope that together with international organizations, with all our partners, we will be able to return the plant under the full control of Ukraine and force Russia to withdraw all its military personnel and weapons from the plant. Immediate and complete demilitarization of the ZNPP is needed. Only Ukraine can guarantee that all processes at the Zaporizhzhia plant will take place in accordance with standards and under control. Russia simply does not need it. Today I also held a meeting with American senators - Mr. Portman and Ms. Klobuchar, who arrived in Kyiv. These are people who have done a lot to protect our state and generally freedom in Europe and the world. I thanked them for the bipartisan support. The key topic of the negotiations is, of course, our interaction with the United States of America and the necessary steps for our joint victory in this battle for freedom. In particular, we discussed the strengthening of support for Ukraine - financial and security, strengthening of sanctions against Russia - these sanctions should grow like a snowball in order to demolish the terrorist potential of this state. Over this day, the occupiers brutally shelled Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and our other cities. And almost everywhere - civil infrastructure exactly. Only one Russian shelling of Kharkiv took the lives of 5 people today, another 12 were wounded. There are also victims as a result of other shelling occasions... Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken away by the occupiers! The Armed Forces of our country, our special services, our intelligence are doing everything possible and impossible for every Russian military to necessarily feel the Ukrainian response to this horrible terror that Russia has brought to our land. Throughout the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, from Crimea to the Kharkiv region, the Russian army does not have and will not have a single safe base, a single quiet place. Our defenders will destroy all warehouses, headquarters of the occupiers, their equipment, wherever they are located. Near Sevastopol - then near Sevastopol. Near Luhansk - then near Luhansk. This is Ukrainian land, and the occupiers can do only two things - flee or surrender. We leave them no other options. Currently, active hostilities are taking place almost along the entire frontline - in the south, in the Kharkiv region and in Donbas. Today I especially want to thank the warriors of the 56th and 110th brigades, who are showing maximum resilience and heroism in the Avdiivka direction. The warriors of the 53rd and 93rd brigades, who are defending the Bakhmut direction, defending courageously, intelligently, heroically. The Russian military command was instructed to capture the Donetsk region by the end of August. The end of August is already tomorrow. And in Donbas there are the Ukrainian flag and the Ukrainian heroes. Despite everything - despite the round-the-clock Russian fire, despite the occupiers' efforts to send various mercenaries and convicts there... I thank each and every one who stands firm, who defends positions and who accurately \"subtracts\" the invaders, their equipment, logistics and ammunition. Also, today I want to once again draw the attention of all our people in Crimea - please stay away from Russian military facilities, do not stay near Russian bases and military airfields, inform the special services of Ukraine of all the information you know about the occupiers, so that the liberation of Crimea can happen faster. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal glory to all those who help in the fight for life, for independence! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Prime Minister Fiala! Dear participants of the Forum! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today. Today is already the 189th day of the full-scale war of the Ukrainian people for freedom. And this is a war for freedom not only for our people. At different times and in different parts of the world, just such battles in which freedom either wins or loses take place. Not for one nation - for many. For many countries and for a long period of time. We all remember 1968. We remember how people then felt the desire for freedom, how they fought for freedom, and how a historic chance for freedom arose in the center of Europe for a huge space that was under the rule of tyranny at that time. That chance was destroyed by Soviet tanks in Prague. The world then did not feel the scale of this battle and what exactly was being destroyed. It did not feel what the result of victory would be, and did not want to see immediately what the defeat of freedom in this battle would lead to. Europe is still forced to overcome the consequences of the fact that tyranny managed to hold on for another 20 years at that time. Managed to hold on due to the fact that freedom did not get help. Did not get help to express itself to the fullest. Was not armed as it should have been. And due to the fact that people did not unite for its sake. What did it lead to? To death and suffering. To the wave of refugees. To the point that the countries of eastern and central Europe remained without freedom for more decades. And not only without political, cultural or personal freedom of people. But also without economic freedom, without many manifestations of normal social development. Only children and grandchildren were able to get the opportunities and well-being that should have been rightfully enjoyed by the generation of their parents who were young during the Prague Spring. But the most terrible thing is that the supporters of tyranny who lived at that time and who saw the destruction of freedom by tanks, all those who are annoyed by freedom, all those who despise the right of peoples to self-determination, just then got the illusion that freedom would lose to tanks. The illusion that it is just necessary to be cruel enough, to send a sufficient number of tanks, to intimidate the democratic world - and freedom will not endure and will inevitably fall. You hear exactly this illusion when the opponents of freedom say that it is necessary to more decisively suppress with tanks this or that protest, this or that uprising. When they say that it is just necessary to send more tanks to suppress the independence of this or that nation. This illusion caused a lot of evil after 1968. And this illusion is at the heart of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24. But right here, on our land, and right now, in our time, we have a historic chance to destroy this illusion! In Ukraine, there is now a decisive battle for freedom. I am grateful to you that we are not alone in this battle. I am grateful for the support we have received. Grateful for the unity we maintain. I want to note the role of the Czech Republic in the protection of freedom - it is really significant. The personal involvement of Prime Minister Fiala and many representatives of your state is really important for us. We have already done a lot. Tyranny has felt that free nations know how to defend themselves, and that the victory of freedom is absolutely probable. This was achieved in different vectors of confrontation. From the frontline, where our Ukrainian warriors physically defend freedom, to the political sphere, in which we managed to achieve a historic result for the sake of Europe. Even in such a terrible time, Ukraine did everything necessary to obtain the status of a candidate for membership of the European Union. I am grateful to the people of the Czech Republic, your government and parliament for supporting us on the European path. However, the battle for freedom still continues! The length of the frontline on Ukrainian soil is 2.5 thousand kilometers. Active hostilities - with the use of all possible types of weapons, except, fortunately, weapons of mass destruction - continue on a line of 1.3 thousand kilometers. Imagine this scale! It is like the road from Kyiv to Prague. Russia is throwing everything it has to the frontline. And it has a lot of weapons and ammunition left from the time of the Soviet Union. And the occupiers are not restrained by the norms of any conventions or even elementary humanity. They are brutally shelling our cities with artillery. Every day and every night, people die from these terrible shelling occasions, from missile and air strikes. The mass terror against the people in the occupied territory has reached a level that Europe had only seen during World War II from the Nazis. Russia is blackmailing Ukraine, Europe and the world with a radiation disaster at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Think about it! No enemy of humanity has ever resorted to such blackmail - turned a nuclear power plant into a battlefield. Therefore, we all need to do a lot more together to win this battle for life. Ukraine needs constant and sufficient support with weapons and ammunition. So that we can not only hold the frontline, but also expel tyranny from our land, finally destroy its plans to subjugate Ukraine and anyone else in Europe. We also need financial support, and all leaders of the free world, heads of European structures are aware about this need. Winning a war requires financial stability. The world has already armed freedom in this battle against tyranny with powerful sanctions against Russia. But the potential of the terrorist state has not yet been destroyed by these sanctions. Russia still hopes that it will adapt to the sanctions and be able to withstand the pressure of the free world. Therefore, new sanctions packages are needed. From everyone - without exception. Rosatom and the entire nuclear industry of Russia must face blocking sanctions for radiation blackmail at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Russian nuclear scientists are working to repeat the Chornobyl disaster - this must be punished. Before it's not too late. Thanks to sanctions, all potential aggressor states in the world should see that the price of radiation blackmail will be unbearable for the blackmailer. It is necessary to finally completely block the Russian banking system. How much can we talk about it? It is absurd that Russian banks can still work with the world financial system, as the Russian state is doing everything to cause the world as much damage as possible! We have already mitigated the acuteness of the food crisis provoked by Russia. Likewise, we must do everything to alleviate the energy crisis, due to which Russia is trying to destroy our unity and ability to defend ourselves. Russia is doing everything to ensure that the price crisis hits the democracies, hits powerfully, so that chaos spreads in Europe and the world. Hence, we must do everything we can to remove any energy dependence on Russia, to eliminate its ability to make money from energy sources and to help people survive this crisis. For our part, we offer our electricity to the EU countries - it is much cheaper than on the European market. Ukraine joined the unified energy system of the continent. We can export many times more electricity than now. Due to this, Ukraine can help at least its neighbors in the European Union overcome the price crisis, and this will definitely reduce the severity of the price crisis in the whole of Europe. We must think together how to get through this winter, given the situation on the gas market. No country in Europe - neither Ukraine, nor the Czech Republic, nor anyone else - should be left alone with the gas problem, as this is Russia's goal. To ensure that we do not help each other. And finally, there must be a value-based response to everything that tyranny has brought to Europe now. To all this terror. Of course, I hope for your support in the creation and functioning of the Special Tribunal to punish those who started the war against Ukraine for the crime of aggression. Of course, we must do everything possible together to punish everyone who killed, tortured, deported Ukrainians. And, by the way, all this will become a historical punishment, in particular, for the system that sent tanks to you in 1968. Another imperative step we must take now. A value-based step. An ethical one. Russian propagandists can still work in European countries. Russian television, which is probably the biggest disinformation source in the world, is still available in European countries. And who are they working against, tell me? What exactly are they trying to destroy or at least discredit in the first place? European democracy! And Europe needs full protection from Russian propaganda. No Russian propagandist should remain on the territory of the EU. No Russian state television channel should operate on the territory of the EU. And the territory of the EU should be closed to those citizens of Russia who use Europe to rest from the evil they condone at home with their silence. Visa restrictions will encourage Russian citizens to feel that freedom must be fought for. Closing the European visa space for tourists from Russia will definitely protect all countries from the killers who were in Salisbury or Vrbětice. Ladies and Gentlemen! I have no doubt that we will win the battle for freedom. I have no doubt that we are capable of protecting Europe from any crises that Russia creates. And I have no doubt that we will rebuild everything that was destroyed by the war. But for all this to happen, we must have no doubt that we will preserve our unity - the unity of all Europeans, the unity of the free world. I believe that the Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union will protect and strengthen our unity. Everyone who stands for freedom should stand together! Together until victory! Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today was a really busy day. I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. All relevant leaders were there: Zaluzhny, Monastyrskyi, Budanov, Maliuk, Danilov and others. I think it is obvious what issues we considered. The military reported on the situation on the frontline, on the development of the situation. I will not reveal the details now. I will say only one thing: on behalf of our intelligence, I want to thank all our people who support us very strongly in the south of our country, and especially in Crimea. The intelligence officers are grateful for the information provided and will use it to the maximum. Let the enemies not forget whose peninsula they are staying on. Temporarily staying. The fighting in Donbas remains fierce – the hot spots in the region have not changed. Our guys are holding their ground. I am grateful to every warrior for resilience! Today I held a meeting with representatives of the Parliament and the Government of Ukraine regarding the current plans of the state’s work. I took part in the work of a very respectable forum in the Czech Republic, in Prague, called Forum 2000. It was founded by Václav Havel and is attracting significant attention in Europe. I addressed the participants of the forum and urged them to strengthen the support of our state in this war and the protection of all of Europe from Russian pressure. In particular, the issue of limiting European visas for citizens of Russia should be finally resolved. I think it is humiliating for Europe when it is considered as just one big boutique or restaurant. Europe is primarily a territory of values, not primitive consumption. And when the citizens of the state that wants to destroy European values use Europe for their entertainment or shopping, for the vacation of their mistresses while they themselves work for the war or to simply silently wait out the immoral fall of Russia, which is happening right now, this is completely contrary to everything which Europe was united for in general. The European Union was intended to maintain peace on the continent. Work for peaceful and democratic development of European countries. Europe cannot become morally deaf. And none of the European leaders will be able to justify the fact that the money allegedly doesn’t smell for them with the consequences of COVID. Because if there is such deafness, if there is such a loss of the ability to distinguish the smell of blood on bills, there will be no Europe, there will be no peaceful Europe. I am grateful to those Europeans who understand that in wartime it is the duty of any normal person to fight for the aggressor to lose, for the occupation to end, for the Russian military to leave Ukrainian land. Today I want to thank all our agricultural workers, port workers, diplomats and government officials who returned the status of a real guarantor of food security in African countries to Ukraine. 23 thousand tons of Ukrainian wheat under the UN World Food Programme have already arrived at the port of Djibouti. And they will be delivered to the people of Ethiopia, where there is the worst drought in the last 40 years and millions of people are on the verge of starvation. We are also restoring the relevant connections with the countries of the Arabian Peninsula - almost 40 thousand tons of wheat are headed to Yemen. And in general, more than 1.5 million tons of our food have already been exported by sea from the three ports that became operational thanks to the grain export initiative. We are doing everything for the world to feel the importance of Ukraine and be grateful to our people. I signed the decree on awarding our warriors today. 149 combatants were awarded state awards, 15 of them posthumously. We will always remember our heroes! Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear participants and guests of the Venice Film Festival! I appreciate the opportunity to address you today and tell our story. Tell about Ukraine, its people and the war that Russia has been waging against us for 189 days. A story that is beyond competition and beyond the limits of humanity and common sense. A drama based on real events. Embodied in life by real savages, murderers, torturers, terrorists. A tragedy accompanied not by Morricone's brilliant music, but by gruesome ditties and sounds of explosions, gunshots and air raid sirens. Horror, not 120 minutes but 189 days long. 189 days of war, which continues in Ukraine and which Europe and the world are allegedly tired of. This is what Russia claims. This is what Russia wants. A primitive plot in three acts for the world to make three dramatic mistakes. To get used to the war. To put up with the war. To forget about the war. This intention should never succeed.  Cultural figures, directors, producers, actors, screenwriters, DOPs, composers, artists, designers, film critics and thousands of other people - from different countries of the world and one cinematographic family. Your position is important, your voice is influential, your word is loud. The least you can do today, or rather, NOT do, is not to be silent, not to be afraid, not to turn away, not to pass by and not to be indifferent to the war in Ukraine, which was unleashed by Russia. Ladies and Gentlemen! For someone, power is only missiles and nuclear warheads. For us, power is in philosophy, mentality, these are meanings and words. For us it is also a weapon. I want every country, every nation, every institution and community in the world to have a clear idea of what Ukraine is going through now. To hear about this war in the most understandable language. For you, this is the language of cinematography. But you won't see any scary footage now: explosions, gunshots, destruction, smoke, pain and tears. You will see things that most people don't usually see. An integral part of every film, which not everyone pays attention to. Important names that fade into oblivion and obscurity, because the moment they appear on the screen, most viewers do two things: stand up and leave. I know that the first thing today is important. The second is impossible. To be continued… To be continued? The answer to this question today depends on all of us. Whenever someone talks about being tired of Ukraine, these titles should be mentioned. To get tired of Ukraine means to brush off these names. To forget these names. I am confident that the whole civilized world will never do this, will never give up, will stand with Ukraine to the end, to the victorious end, when truth and justice will hear applause! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear children! Dear schoolchildren, students! Dear children of Ukraine who are going to school for the first time today! Dear schoolchildren returning to school! Dear students who acquire professional skills! Dear friends! Today, September 1st is your Day, an important day for all of us, the Day of Knowledge. This year's September 1st is very different from the thirty previous ones. But it still combines dozens of previous ones. Previous years, previous centuries. Battles that have been and battles that are going on. The victories that slipped away from our people, and the victories that the Ukrainians won, and the victory that will surely come. Today is the Day of Knowledge – the 190th day of knowledge. Knowledge that summarizes more than a thousand years of Ukrainian history, Ukrainian culture, Ukrainian life. Life – against all odds. Despite any threats. Despite enemy's aspirations that have always lost and will lose to our desire to live. Your desire. The desire to love and be friends, to develop and grow, to defend what was received from parents and learn new things. That is, to learn and get stronger. That's what makes this school year so special. It starts differently for everyone. Someone is far from home – in other regions of Ukraine. Someone is far from home – in other countries. Someone remotely – online. Someone is at their home school or at their university, but still – not at peace. However, it is important that the school year begins. It is important that learning continues. And that knowledge about Ukraine is not interrupted. Because this knowledge gives us strength. This knowledge has become our weapon. \"Knowing\" and \"defending\" always go hand in hand. To know more than a thousand years of history of our statehood and to defend when someone says that Ukraine did not exist. To know our geography – our beautiful land, our wonderful sea – and to defend not just the territory, but the incredible places where our identity was created at different times. To know our culture, to hear the Ukrainian word, because the answer is in our culture, in our literature, in our poetry. The answer of Shevchenko and Franko, Lesya Ukrainka and Stus, Symonenko and Honchar, Lina Kostenko and many others... The answer is why we will win. The crystal-white night was pierced by the sound of rockets. The sky is all in a bloody wreath, in a wreath of fires. How did the Ukrainians respond to this? On February 24, we united. Everyone united. We stood up for defending the dearest thing that we have. And you showed yourself – our children. We're warriors, not lazy, not lying down. And our cause is true and holy. Don't care what others are fighting for, We're fighting for independence. That's why our lives are so hard. Our children supported us, supported the state. They grew up very quickly. They did not get scared. And they helped. They helped – in bomb shelters. They took care of parents who were injured. They brought water and food – to the military. They raised money – to give to volunteers for the army. One can only be proud of Ukrainian children. Be patient, be patient – patience you grind, Steel your spirit - and be patient therefore, endure. No one will save you from troubles. No one will knock you off your own track. Stand on it. To death. Firmly. As long as light and sun, stand and wait. Pave your way – the one that you identified yourself, The one who chose you forever and ever. You have committed yourself to it since childhood, The Lord himself doomed you to it. This summer - no one had a summer. Time passed, as if from winter to winter. Instead of playgrounds, it was possible to be in basements. Instead of playing football in the street, children had to stay with adults and hear too much tragic news. But you were brave. And you made your choice – a choice in favor of Ukraine. Entire Ukraine – from Uzhgorod to Yalta, from Chornomorsk to Kharkiv. For the benefit of all our people. My Nation exists, and my Nation will always continue to exist! Nobody will scratch out my nation! All renegades and strays will disappear. And so will the hordes of conquerors-invaders! And it was a lesson for them, When the whole world could see, As if in millstones, our strong hands Ground the barbarian horde. We all know that victory will come. You all know that there will be victory. They stole part of your childhood, part of your youth... But you are free. You always will be. So be worthy of your will – and of our Ukraine. And everyone holds heavy iron hammer, And loud voice from top like thunder booms: \"Thou split this rock! Don't let no cold, nor heat To stop you! Endure the drudgery, and thirst, and hunger, Because you are to break this rock apart!\" And on the reborn earth There will be no enemy, no tyrant There will be a son, and there will be a mother, And there will be people on the earth. Today you go to school, begin your studies, continue getting an education. Today you are going to the opportunity to see, hear, know – Ukraine. Knowledge about it, words about it, dreams about it - which were all about you. About your life. Free, clean, brave and smart. Today, I cannot but congratulate our people for having such children in Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear friends! Dear Polish people, brothers and sisters! Already 83 years separate us from that morning that put Europe and the world on the brink of ruin. On September 1, 1939, around 4 a.m., the Polish city of Wieluń was the target of a terrible bombardment. Nazi Germany went to war against all free nations, starting with Poland. And there will not be such a generation of Ukrainians, Poles, all Europeans or people in general who will forget what Nazism brought and what the Nazi executioners were held accountable for. People believed that it would be possible to avoid the repetition of those terrible crimes and such a cruel war. But it was such a morning again. Only on February 24, 2022, when bombs and missiles hit peaceful cities. Once again, the ideology of hatred is trying to seize space in Europe through mass murder and terror. Wieluń is repeated – in Kharkiv, in Mykolaiv, in the cities of Donbas, in Mariupol. Burnt cities and villages were repeated. Katyń was repeated – in Olenivka. The deportation was repeated. But there is something that did not happen again. No one made criminal pacts with hatred. And from the first minute of this war, we receive real help from true friends and brothers, who have become our powerful rear and are doing everything to help us win. We will do everything to ensure that Ukrainians, Poles and all the peoples of Europe live freely. So that every generation of our peoples, all Europeans and people in general remember what racism was and what the racist executioners will be punished for. We will do everything to ensure that the morning of September 1, the morning of June 22 and the morning of February 24 do not repeat. Never again. We will do everything so that hatred finally loses. Thank you for your support! Thank you, dear Andrzej, for your leadership! Glory to Poland! Glory to Ukraine! Eternal memory to all innocent victims!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today, a new academic year began in our country, as it should be. Despite everything. More than six months of full-scale war. Extraordinary destruction caused by the occupiers. But the education of Ukrainian children continues. It takes place in various formats, yet systematically and professionally everywhere. And I am grateful to all our educators who continue their work and guarantee with their attention to children that all young Ukrainians have an opportunity to become educated and live a decent modern life. More than 300,000 first-graders, almost 4 million pupils - this is the scale of September 1 this year. So, in addition to many other conclusions, a very important political conclusion can be made today - about the resilience of our state, about the strength of our society. Our educational institutions are effective. Our state and local communities ensure the restoration of education even in those areas where schools were destroyed during the occupation. Today I was in Irpin, Kyiv region. I saw the beginning of the work of such a restored school. 1,300 pupils will get their education there. The children went to the first grade, as is customary. I was happy to see them starting to study and to see the conditions it happens in. A good, comfortable, humanly warm school. And it will be the same on the entire territory of our state, which we will definitely oust the invaders from. No matter what they destroyed, we will restore everything, we will rebuild everything. No matter how much they want to destroy Ukraine and anything Ukrainian, our children will still go to their schools and universities and get an education absolutely freely. National education. Humanistic education. Education built not on lies and propaganda spread by the terrorist state, but on real knowledge, openness to the world and the best human values. Today, the IAEA mission arrived at Zaporizhzhia NPP. It's good that it happened. The fact itself despite all the provocations by the Russian military and the cynical shelling of Enerhodar and the territory of the plant. Ukraine did everything to make this mission happen. But it is bad that the occupiers are trying to turn this IAEA mission - a really necessary one - into a fruitless tour of the plant. I believe that this will be prevented. It is good that the IAEA representatives have an opportunity to draw objective conclusions about the risks that have arisen at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant for the first time in history. Moreover, the risks that have arisen precisely because of the occupiers. The main thing is to have the will to draw objective conclusions. Constant shelling, the presence of Russian military and weapons at the plant, tormenting Ukrainian personnel and attempts to put the plant under the control of Rosatom representatives who are not at all capable of a responsible attitude towards such an object... These are the reasons for the risks. We have clear evidence that Russia did a lot of cynical things to deceive the mission. In particular, with the help of intimidation of residents of Enerhodar. The occupiers forced people to lie to the IAEA representatives - to hand over some papers, sign something, say something. When we met with Mr. Grossi and members of the mission in Kyiv, we agreed that the mission would be accompanied by journalists from Ukrainian and international media. Independent journalists. For the world to see the truth. To see what is really happening. Unfortunately, this wasn’t done. Although it was promised. Unfortunately, the occupiers did not let the journalists in, but organized a bunch of their propagandists. Unfortunately, the IAEA representatives did not protect the representatives of independent media. We are hopeful that the mission will nevertheless draw objective conclusions from the circumstances at the plant. For more than three decades, 5 facilities have been under the control of our specialists - the Chornobyl plant and 4 operational nuclear power plants. The IAEA never had any claims regarding the activities of any of these facilities until Russia invaded our territory and brought its madness here. When the Russian military finally leave the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, when they take away their weapons, ammunition, when they stop shelling Enerhodar and neighboring areas and cease their provocations, the Zaporizhzhia plant will be able to return to a completely safe functioning, which has always been the case under the control of Ukraine. And the key thing that should happen is the demilitarization of the territory of the plant. This is exactly the goal of Ukrainian and international efforts. And it is bad that we have not yet heard the appropriate calls from the IAEA. Although we talked about it with Mr. Grossi at our meeting in Kyiv. This was the key - the key! - security point of our agreements. It was clearly stated: demilitarization and full control by Ukrainian nuclear specialists. Today I had a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark who arrived in Ukraine. I thanked him for the support, which is a very useful support, in particular in the field of defense. We discussed further steps to defend Ukraine and the entire united Europe, the sanction policy and the restoration of our state after hostilities. I held the first conversation with the new Prime Minister of Israel Lapid. I emphasized the necessity of Israel’s accession to the sanctions on Russia, sanctions for all the evil brought by this war. The evil that should have never returned again. I addressed the Polish people - September 1 is the anniversary of the beginning of World War II. I said an important thing in this address: just as that aggressor was defeated and convicted, this aggressor will inevitably be defeated and convicted as well. When the free world is united and the victim of aggression is not left alone, when no one signs disgraceful pacts with evil, the war ends with the victory of the forces of good. I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 155 combatants were awarded state awards, 22 of them posthumously. In total, since February 24, 28,042 Ukrainian warriors have received state awards. Those who heroically defend our state in all directions. Who ousted the enemy from the north, who are beating the occupiers in the east, who are destroying them in the south and, what is very important now, are working for the liberation of our Crimea. And today I especially want to express gratitude to our defenders in the Kharkiv direction - the 92nd brigade, all warriors and сommanding officer of the brigade Fedosenko. Thanks for your bravery guys! And also to our Air Forces. Yesterday, the anti-aircraft troops in the Donetsk region did a very good job - shot down another helicopter of the occupiers, already the 205th during the full-scale war, and two UAVs. In total, more than 800 Russian drones have already been destroyed. Today, our Air Forces did a good job against enemy missiles - thank you for the result! I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear participants of the Forum! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you right now as we are all going through a very risky time in this war. I would like to start with a fact that you may have missed. But I ask you to pay attention to it. Pay attention to the fact that the work of the Forum is currently being monitored by independent media. As far as I know, representatives of such media as Corriere della Sera, Rai, La Repubblica, La Stampa, New York Times, Financial Times, Reuters, Fox Business Channel, CNBC Europe are present at the Forum. And I think many others. In general, 280 media representatives cover the Forum. We are open to all. And we are open to them. And I can't imagine that any of us are afraid of such or similar media. But I will tell you who is afraid of them. As you know, Ukraine is at the epicenter of Russian radiation blackmail right now. The Russian army seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant back in March and still holds it captive. This is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe - there are six nuclear reactors. The plant was repeatedly shelled. On the very first night, when the Russian occupiers entered there, on the night of March 4, they fired at the plant’s premises from tanks. There is video confirmation. Over the months after that, the situation has not changed - shelling and provocations every day, constantly. Under the cover of a nuclear plant, the Russian army is shelling neighboring cities and districts - this was the strategy. The occupiers are also shelling the plant itself - to put pressure on Ukraine and on all of you in Europe and on the world. The whole world. They want you to show weakness, to give up and stop supporting Ukraine. This is why Russia is doing this radiation blackmail. Recently, the Zaporizhzhia NPP was literally one step away from disaster - when the power transmission lines were damaged as a result of shelling, automation began to shut down the reactors. Only the Ukrainian nuclear engineers, who work there absolutely professionally even in such difficult conditions, manage to prevent the accident. If it was not for our professional people, Russia would have already provoked the worst disaster in the history of Europe - even worse than Chornobyl. And it is logical that this requires a strong international reaction. With the help of our partners, we ensured that the IAEA mission was sent to the plant - just yesterday the mission was there. We agreed with the head of the IAEA, Mr. Grossi, the members of the mission, when I met with them, that they would help with the key issue - the key issue of the safety of the nuclear power plant, the key issue is the demilitarization of the plant. Because this is key to protecting all of us, all Europeans, from a radiation disaster. We also agreed that together with the IAEA mission, independent journalists from Ukrainian and international media will arrive at the territory of Zaporizhzhia NPP. The same media that are currently covering this Forum. But what did we see? The Russian military stopped the journalists traveling with the mission at a checkpoint and did not let them go any further. Obviously, the occupiers felt that in the presence of a free media it would be impossible to lie to the IAEA and the whole world. Free media scares Russia. And this says everything at once - if you do not allow independent journalists to the plant, it means you are definitely aware of your responsibility for the catastrophe that the plant is on the verge of, and you are afraid that the world will draw conclusions about your responsibility. Unfortunately, the mission did not protect the journalists and did not put enough pressure on the Russians so that independent media would still be at the plant, so that everything would be open and fair there. And we talked about it with the mission and agreed. We said that without the admission of independent journalists, Russian propagandists would dominate the place. It would be a theater. Unfortunately, we also have not yet heard from the IAEA the key thing - the call to Russia regarding the demilitarization of the plant. And how can you do without it? I really hope that the mission will adhere to what the parties have agreed upon and what is in the interests of the entire international community. The greatest risk of a radiation disaster in 40 years must be removed. It is impossible to leave the military of the terrorist state at the nuclear power plant. There are situations when the fate of everyone on the continent depends on keeping one's word. This is exactly the situation now. Ukraine has repeatedly demonstrated that we always keep our word. Always. This is evident in many areas. Of course, we did everything to ensure that the IAEA got access to the Zaporizhzhia NPP. I believe that this mission can still be fruitful. And also - this is another example - we have fulfilled our obligations for the grain export initiative, which alleviates the food crisis in the world. And therefore, it prevents a new migrant crisis. Famine in the countries of Africa and Asia would lead to new waves of migrants to Europe and, in particular, to the Mediterranean coast, to Italy. But we do everything for this not to happen. Ukrainian food has already reached 20 countries by sea. Our wheat was also sent to such countries as Ethiopia and Yemen, where the situation is particularly difficult. We will continue to keep our word on food safety guarantees. We are ready to help stop the price chaos in Europe. While Russia is making efforts to increase gas shortages on the market and prices, Ukraine is willing to increase electricity exports to EU countries. The return of the Zaporizhzhia plant to a safe mode of operation and its connection to the Ukrainian power grid is important particularly for this as well. The Russian presence at the plant significantly weakens our ability to help Europe in the energy sphere. At the expense of our electricity exports, we can stabilize the energy consumption of our neighbors in the EU, and as a result, this will reduce Russia's energy pressure on the whole of Europe, and therefore on Italy. Even now, despite all the difficulties, we can export such a volume of electricity that corresponds to at least eight percent of the consumption of the whole of Italy. Moreover, Ukraine can become a green energy hub for Europe, which will replace Russia's dirty energy resources. Dirty - in different senses of the word: both environmentally and morally. Our country has a huge natural potential for the development of capacities in green energy and in the production of green hydrogen. This is a potential of at least tens, and possibly hundreds of gigawatts of green electrical power and millions of tons of green hydrogen. It is important that there is already an infrastructure for transporting electricity and hydrogen to the EU. All this is there. And we have always kept our word on providing Europe with energy resources. Just compare it to the typical behavior of Russia, which always breaches treaties and uses the economy for political blackmail, not fulfilling its own promises. Even during a full-scale war, Ukraine did everything to gain the status of a candidate for EU membership. We quickly and efficiently fulfilled our obligations and we will do everything to start negotiations on EU membership. We will definitely be together with you in a united Europe. I am grateful to Italy and I am personally grateful to Prime Minister Mario Draghi for supporting our country on this European path and in protecting it from Russian aggression. Every word of our agreements with Mr. Draghi has been adhered to one hundred percent. A truly worthy person, truly worthy relations between our states. And life itself demonstrates that we need even more integration, even more agreements and results. We must ensure full compliance with every promise to increase pressure on Russia to finally stop the radiation blackmail, guarantee the complete safety of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and four other large nuclear facilities in Ukraine. All words regarding the support of Ukraine with weapons, shells and finances must be confirmed by actions as long as this war continues. Russia does not understand the words of peace. But it feels the strength on the battlefield very well. Strength should be with Ukraine, with the free world. Including the sanctions that the world applies as self-defense against Russian aggression. Strength should also be with business, primarily in Europe. The reputation of none of the companies will withstand radiation sickness. Therefore, it is necessary to immediately sever relations with the country that resorted to radiation blackmail. And don't wait for disasters to make decisions, switch to predictable partners. Ukraine is just such a partner. Of course, now it is the war. Of course, Russian missiles hit our land. We lose people every day. And I will remind you of just one terrible number - 379. This is the number of Ukrainian children killed by Russian strikes. More than 735 children were wounded. All together in Europe and in the free world we have the power to end this war. And therefore, over time, we can move to much more meaningful economic relations. Ukraine is already one of the world's largest producers of agricultural crops. You have already talked about this today. And together we can build one of the largest agro-processing clusters, strengthen our ability to be a guarantor of food security making Ukraine a place of production of affordable food for the whole world. Also, Ukraine is ideal for locating any processing enterprises. From woodworking to all types of mechanical engineering. We have a large amount of almost all resources and minerals - from gas to lithium, qualified people, fast logistics to the European market, good access to it. We want it, we strive for it. Ukraine is an ambitious reconstruction project after hostilities. Reconstruction worth hundreds of billions of euros - of everything that Russia destroyed with its terror. Tens of thousands of different objects have to be created virtually anew. And I am grateful to those Italian companies that have already shown their interest. And Ukraine is a completely new defense and security sector, whose power will match what we experienced in this war, and which will make a fundamental contribution to the security of Europe in the coming decades. Of course, after we force Russia to leave our land and make peace. And this will be possible if all our partners keep their word. Just as Ukraine does. Just as Italy does. I thank you for the firmness of the Italian word, for the actions that confirm that word. Thank you for supporting our state, for supporting our people who found refuge on your land. We will never forget it. I say this frankly, honestly, from the heart, from every citizen. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health! Today, I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief this week. The heads of the defense and security sectors were present, as usual: Zaluzhny, Monastyrsky, Budanov, Maliuk, Danilov and others. The commanders of operational areas – Syrsky, Litvinov, Kovalchuk – reported on the state of affairs. I think that you all understand what the main questions are. Certain decisions have also been made. I think we will all see them. We also considered today the issue of supporting our military, comprehensive support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I held a meeting devoted to the state's further steps in European integration. This is another operational direction of our work – daily important work. For us, the movement of Ukraine to the European Union and the transformation within our country is one of the key elements of the long-term protection of the state, a guarantee of freedom for all Ukrainians. Therefore, the European integration process deserves not just separate attention to political, economic, social, and legal aspects, but a holistic approach. Moving towards Europe, we are strengthening Ukrainian national life as a whole. I am sure that Ukraine will become a full member of the EU. At least let's do everything for it. I took part today in the work of an important forum in Italy. One of the most influential economic forums in Europe is the Ambrosetti Forum. I thanked Prime Minister Draghi, all Italians who help us and also protect the Ukrainian desire for freedom, for Europe. He proposed new directions of cooperation between our states – now and after our victory. It is important for Ukraine to maintain and strengthen Italian support despite any changes in political attitudes. By the way, this week it was the second address to Italian society – after the address to the participants and guests of the Venice Film Festival. We are fighting for support and understanding of Ukraine in all European countries, in all audiences of European societies. I remind you every time that the protection of Ukraine is the protection of all of Europe. Not only ours, but the entire democratic world. It is from this point of view that it is worth considering the decision agreed today by the G7 countries to cap the price of Russian oil. When this mechanism is implemented, it will become an important element of protecting civilized countries and energy markets from Russian hybrid aggression. Indeed, the price of Russian gas must also be capped. I am grateful to Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, who said this today. It is long overdue for such energy sanctions against Russia. The sanctions that will not only limit the flow of petrodollars and gas euros to Moscow, but also, importantly, restore justice for all Europeans, whom Russia is trying to blackmail with artificially inflated prices on the energy market. I signed another decree on awarding our soldiers. 166 combatants were given state awards, 44 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our soldiers who beat the invaders everywhere in Ukraine, on our land! The Kharkiv area, Donetsk region, the entire Donbas, the south, Crimea – Ukraine is and will be everywhere. That's it! There will be freedom. That's it! And there will be Europe. We will never give ours to the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Today, our Air Force has a good result – downed Kaliber missiles, an attack helicopter of the occupiers, drones. I want to thank all our defenders of the sky from the East air command. Well done, today and always. Each such result is a saved life of our citizens, an opportunity not to be afraid for all our people. We will do everything so that Ukraine can fully defend its skies from Russian missiles and aviation. This is one of the fundamental issues for our country. And, of course, we are grateful to all our partners who help with the answer to this difficult question. Helping Ukraine with air defense is the most literal, most obvious way to protect people from Russian terror. Fierce fighting continues in many areas of the front – both in Kharkiv region, in Donbas, and in the south of our country. Russian troops again attacked Mykolaiv region, the districts of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk regions, and Kharkiv. Unfortunately, there are victims, and among them, unfortunately, are children. Ukrainian artillery is doing everything to destroy the striking potential of the occupiers, so that every Russian headquarters and all their ammunition depots, all logistical routes in the occupied territory are neutralized. I thank our soldiers who ensure this. Today, in particular, the fighters of the 55th artillery brigade in the Donetsk direction merit special mention – for their accurate fire on the enemy. I'm grateful to our intelligence and the Security Service of Ukraine for the accuracy of our answers regarding the positions and objects of the occupiers. Unfortunately, today we have an absolutely unacceptable event in the city of Chernihiv. In the afternoon, an explosion rang out at a public event in the city center, and a grenade launcher went off. Children are among the victims. The little boy is now in serious condition in intensive care. The law enforcement officers should find out as soon as possible why this happened, who brought combat weapons to this city event. All those responsible must be brought to justice. And they will be. And I call on the representatives of local authorities throughout the country, all our law enforcement officers to be very careful so that this never happens again anywhere. These days, Russia is trying to increase the energy pressure on Europe even more – gas pumping through the Nord Stream pipeline has completely stopped. Why do they do this? Russia wants to destroy the normal life of every European – in all countries of our continent. It wants to weaken and intimidate the entire Europe, every state. Where Russia cannot do it by force of conventional weapons, it does so by force of energy weapons. It is trying to attack with poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles. And to protect against this, we all in Europe need even more unity, even more coordination, even more help to each other. This winter, Russia is preparing for a decisive energy attack on all Europeans. And the key answers to this should be two things: first, our unity – unity in protection against the terrorist state, and second – Increasing our own pressure on Russia – this includes increasing sanctions at all levels, and limiting Russia's oil and gas revenues. The more strikes we all make together, the fewer strikes these terrorists will be able to make. Thank you to everyone who defends our country! Thanks to everyone who helps us! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today is the anniversary of the detention of the first deputy chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, Nariman Celâl, by the occupiers in Crimea. He did not commit any crimes. The only thing he annoyed the occupiers with was the defense of his people and his country – Ukraine. Nariman Celâl took part in the work of the Crimea Platform last year. He arrived at the summit from Crimea and told the guests and participants what was really happening on the peninsula. Told about repression against all those who try to preserve their freedom and their culture. About the degradation of life in Crimea during the occupation. The Russian presence in our Crimea has turned it into one of the most dangerous and unfree places in Europe. And Mr. Celâl wanted to do everything to change this - to return normal life to Crimea, to return Ukraine. I believe that the Ukrainian flag and free life will return to Crimea again. We will liberate all our lands, all our people. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence, special services are already taking the necessary steps for this. These steps can be heard. And everyone can see that the occupiers have already started fleeing Crimea. This is the right choice for all of them. We will return freedom to Crimea, to all our people in Crimea, we will return freedom to qırımlılar and we will definitely make Crimea one of the best, most comfortable places in Europe. Crimea deserves it. I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. Although it is Sunday, there are no days off during the war. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, the commanders of operational areas and the head of intelligence delivered reports. Those were good reports. And today I want to thank the warriors of the 63rd battalion of the 103rd territorial defense brigade who ensured the result in the Donetsk region: the settlement was liberated. The 54th brigade in the Lysychansk-Siversk direction also took good steps, advanced and regained certain heights. I would also like to mention the 42nd separate motorized infantry battalion - thanks to its heroic actions, two settlements in the south of our country were liberated. I am grateful to all of you, guys! I spoke today with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. It was, as usual, a very meaningful, very useful conversation about all the aspects of our relations. I expressed gratitude for the support already provided and for the efforts to limit Russian excess profits from oil and gas. I called for speeding up the provision of financial aid to us, to Ukraine. New sanction steps were discussed. In particular, I believe that the eighth package of sanctions should provide for pan-European visa decisions regarding Russian citizens so that none of those involved in this war can enjoy European hospitality. If the citizens of Russia support terror against Ukraine, against the whole of Europe, if they silently watch the genocide in Ukraine, they should not be able to use Europe for entertainment and fun. This is an important moral thing. Europe is a land of values, not Disneyland for supporters of terror. And visa restrictions will definitely demonstrate this. The free world must call the Russians to action - to action against those who started this war. By the way, it is the same as with the gas issue. Ukraine has repeatedly warned Europe that maintaining \"Nord Stream\" ties with Russia will be a problem that can turn into a disaster at any moment. That's exactly what happened. Visa omnivorousness regarding citizens of the aggressor state, financial ties with Russia, energy dependence on Russia are all things that Moscow uses against Europe. And I am grateful to those European leaders who are aware of the level of the threat A very important aspect of today's conversation with Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen is the ability of the European Commission to carry out a rapid assessment as soon as we implement all its recommendations. We work every day for Ukraine's accession to the EU! And every day we do everything to return our flag to our entire territory invaded by the occupiers. I am grateful to all our warriors who are holding and moving our positions forward! I am grateful to everyone who helps the defense of Ukraine! Together we will win! And finally. Today I received a report that two people who were directly involved in the tragic incident in Chernihiv were detained on suspicion of committing a criminal offense. The one who gave the order to bring combat weapons to a public city event. And the one who allowed the child to take the weapon in hands. Criminal proceedings are carried out by the State Bureau of Investigation. Once again, I warn all representatives of the authorities and law enforcement agencies on the ground: make sure that there are no combat weapons or other dangerous items at public events. People's lives are the joint responsibility of everyone who must guarantee safety. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and a great friend of our people, Boris Johnson, is leaving his office. But I believe that he will not leave political activity and will continue to support the defense of freedom in Ukraine, in Britain and around the world. I spoke to him today. As always, it was a very good conversation. It is usually said that there is no friendship in politics, but Boris is the case when you understand each other with half a word, when friendship exists, when it is strong and when it really strengthens both our states. From the first minutes of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine and Europe, Boris was with us. His first and most important question was always: How else can I help? And I want to emphasize: even before February 24, we always felt that Britain stood with Ukraine. In a few years, we really managed to bring Ukrainian-British relations to the highest level throughout the entire time of our independence. This is an unprecedentedly high level. We have signed a very ambitious Political, Free Trade and Strategic Partnership Agreement. We have done a lot to strengthen the ties between our societies - economic, social, cultural. We have launched a program to renew the Ukrainian fleet. And now, during a full-scale war, we have agreed on the specific participation of Britain in the program of rebuilding Ukraine after hostilities. Today I thanked Boris on behalf of all Ukrainians, and I am sure that this is truly a multi-million Ukrainian \"thank you\". I am already looking forward to continuing our cooperation with Boris in his new status. And I am no less looking forward to the start of cooperation with the new Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mrs. Liz Truss. We in Ukraine know her well - she has always been on the bright side of European politics. And I believe that together we will be able to do a lot more to protect our nations and to thwart all Russian destructive efforts. The main thing is to preserve our unity, and this will definitely be the case. Today I also spoke with President of France Emmanuel Macron, for more than an hour and a half. Very meaningful negotiations. First of all, about the situation at the front, about defense support for Ukraine. I am grateful to Mr. President and all the people of France for their unwavering striving for the protection of our common European values, our common united Europe. Separately and in great detail, we have focused on the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. We exchanged views on the results of the IAEA mission to the plant - by the way, the conclusions of the mission are to be presented tomorrow. I hope they will be objective. All the more so, today the last power transmission line connecting the plant to the energy system of Ukraine was damaged due to another Russian provocative shelling. Again - this is the second time - due to Russian provocation, the Zaporizhzhia plant is one step away from a radiation disaster. I consider the fact that Russia is doing this right now, right on the eve of the IAEA conclusions, very eloquent. Shelling the territory of the ZNPP means that the terrorist state does not care what the IAEA says, it does not care what the international community decides. Russia is interested only in keeping the situation the worst for the longest time possible. This can be corrected only by strengthening sanctions, only by officially recognizing Russia as a terrorist state - at all levels. Ukraine has a very clear, transparent and honest position: while we controlled the plant, there was no threat of a radiation disaster. As soon as Russia came, the worst scenario imaginable immediately became possible. This requires an international response - from the UN to every normal state. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to consistently, very thoroughly and accurately destroy warehouses, bases, crossings, headquarters of the occupiers. The Russian army entered the territory of Ukraine without expecting resistance. And it will run away from here having no other hope of salvation. And I want to once again thank all our defenders, our intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine who are doing everything to make it more and more difficult for the occupiers to stay in Ukraine every day. I also want to thank all our people in the temporarily occupied territories who help our army destroy the objects of the invaders. And today I especially want to thank the warriors of one of our rocket artillery brigades, who with their accurate fire destroyed the very Russian depot from which the occupiers took S-300 missiles to bomb Kharkiv. MLRS is a good thing. Thank you, our heroes! The occupiers will definitely get a response for today's missile attack on Kryvyi Rih, for the constant shelling of Zelenodolsk, shelling of Nikopol, the Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the Kharkiv region, the cities of Donbas and our entire territory. Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for the independence of our country! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for your interest in Ukraine! Today is the 195th day of Russia's full-scale invasion of our country. And today we are 195 times more confident in our independence than any time before this war. And it may sound paradoxical, but it is a fact. Ukraine does not for a single moment doubt itself, its future, its victory. Despite the fact that the enemy is still on our land, despite the fact that we still have a long way to go to liberate our entire territory. We have no doubt that it will happen. We already know the outcome of this war, and we are on our way to that outcome. I think you also feel this confidence of ours now, I believe that, at least, otherwise you would not waste your time on Ukraine. Today I want to talk to you about this feeling. About why any success story in Europe is now simply impossible without Ukraine - a story of both political and business success. They are possible only with Ukraine and in Ukraine. Let me provide some facts. First, the fact that we preserve and will preserve our independence is a fundamental factor of security for the entire region, for the entire east and center of Europe. The resilience of Europe depends on our resilience, and we have it. Just recall: when else was the European Union as united and capable of acting together as it is now, when else did we together with our partners - in particular with the United States of America, with President Biden - manage to unite Europe and the entire free world around the struggle for freedom, for our values, the values of freedom? We did an unprecedented thing. And this is not just a temporary thing, this is a fundamental factor. The struggle for our independence is a struggle for the right to stability, the right to security for all of us, for all of Europe. The second fact is that we are perfectly integrated with our region and will be fully integrated with the European Union. Ukraine has already obtained the status of a candidate for EU membership - this happened precisely during this war - and we will definitely obtain full membership. And not only geographically, economically or politically are we integrated with other European nations, but also in terms of values. It is very important. Ukrainians appreciate freedom, education and work. Appreciate in the same way as any developed society. Although our country is attributed to the group of developing countries, we already have all the foundations to become a developed country. It just takes time. Speaking purely about the economy, we already have very profitable logistics and trade relations with the EU market - and these are duty-free conditions. We also have special conditions for access to the markets of Great Britain, Canada and Japan. We have traditional and very strong ties with the United States market. Without our agricultural exports, it is impossible to imagine stability in the markets and in general in many countries, primarily in Asia and Africa, and this was proven by the Russian blockade of our ports - when our agricultural sector stopped, dozens of countries found themselves on the verge of starvation. Now we are re-establishing export links, including by virtue of new routes and partial restoration of traditional sea exports - millions of tons of Ukrainian food are already being exported again, again by sea. The third fact is that we have an almost complete range of natural resources and minerals. From gas to uranium, from lithium to titanium, from coal to quartzite and much more. And we have not only resources, but also a strong culture and tradition of extraction, processing and production. We have qualified people. We have a developed transport sector and convenient logistics - with access to the European Union market. By the way, one of the reasons why Russia started a war of aggression against Ukraine is their apprehension that we will become not just an industrial competitor for Russia, but a real substitute for it in many markets of many countries. The fourth fact is that Ukraine can and, I am sure, will definitely become a green energy hub for Europe. We are capable of replacing dirty Russian energy resources. Ukraine has a huge natural potential for establishing capacities in green energy and in the production of green hydrogen. This is a potential of at least tens, and realistically looking at things – hundreds of gigawatts of green electrical power. Look at the situation in the European energy market - this market desperately needs a player like Ukraine. Of course, we have already started exporting electricity to the EU. It is a very important factor that it happened during the war. We export, but the scale of cooperation can be hundreds of times larger - imagine the profit for each participant in the energy business. The fifth fact is that we have already started the implementation of the project of reconstruction of Ukraine after hostilities. At this stage, this is the Fast Recovery Plan, which allows us now to restore everything that is needed in the liberated territory urgently: social, educational infrastructure, heat supply, transport. But the general project of Ukrainian reconstruction will be the largest economic project in Europe of our time. The largest for several generations. Its volume is already estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. And with the necessary modernization of the Ukrainian infrastructure, taking into account security needs, it is more than a trillion dollars and in a fairly short term - less than ten years. No company will find such opportunities anywhere else in the world as in Ukraine. Your companies will not find anywhere else such opportunities as in Ukraine. Our government delegation headed by First Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Economy Yulia Svyrydenko is present in New York. Mrs. Svyrydenko and other members of the delegation will be able not only to answer your questions about opportunities in Ukraine, but also to present industries and projects for investment. Infrastructure funds will find a large number of projects in the airports and in the construction of new roads and bridges. Real estate funds will receive a market with hundreds of millions of square meters of new housing, offices, logistics, and industrial real estate. Banks and financial institutions can enter the huge lending market for all these projects in Ukraine. Insurance companies will be able to offer new insurance products, taking into account the specifics of our region and our risks. Hotel operators will be able to reveal our great tourist and business potential - the whole world is interested in seeing Ukraine, feeling it and being here. And I encourage you to plan your investment now. Without waiting for us to reach our victory. Pay attention - today about 80 percent of our territory is free from the enemy. Our warriors, our people are constantly increasing this figure. Moving towards victory every day. But victory is not only a military way, it is also an economic way. Our business makes its contribution. Our business is functioning. And most of Ukraine is already willing to implement new business projects. You all know very well that preparation for the implementation of any business project takes time. Time for team building, market analysis, site purchase, design, permitting procedures, etc. The preparation period is always a minimum budget, but a lot of time. Time that is spent while others could already start working. Therefore, start now - to be the first. We have hundreds of thousands of qualified young engineers and IT specialists, and this Ukrainian industry is world-renowned. We have an extremely favorable tax regime for IT. Taking into account all economic and logistical factors, we are a uniquely advantageous location for the offices of technology companies. Deploying production in Ukraine - from metal to pharmaceuticals, from mechanical engineering to agricultural products, you get advantages that you will not find in any other country next to the European Union market. Perhaps some of the companies whose representatives are here now or companies related to you are still working on the Russian market - and not just selling, but producing there. The prospect for all businesses is that they will have to leave Russia in any case. And therefore, it is profitable to come to Ukraine. It is on Ukrainian land that the new center of economic growth in Europe will be. You may ask me: how can you come to Ukraine now, as the war is still ongoing? I will answer you: any company that will have an opportunity to put the Made in Ukraine label on its product will automatically become a part of the story of Ukrainian bravery and victory, a globally known story, and at the same time - a part of our life, which we defend with all our strength - and with the help of the strongest world powers and leaders. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! We’ve got important events today. The European Union has taken a significant step in the visa issue regarding the citizens of Russia. The European Commission has approved a proposal to suspend the simplified visa regime currently in force between the EU and Russia. Of course, this is not yet a complete visa ban. But this already demonstrates to the citizens of the terrorist state that they bear certain moral responsibility for their state's aggression against Ukraine and the whole of Europe. There is such a situation now, when it is inadmissible to remain silent. And it is inadmissible not to oppose terror. It is absolutely unacceptable that European territory can be used for tourism or shopping by those who at home, in Russia, not only support the split and mockery of Europe, but also work for it. And it cannot be taken lightly that Russian propagandists can still stay in European countries, lie daily in reports and broadcasts from European capitals. Lie about Europe! Humiliate Europe! And at the same time be in Europe. An absurdity that must be stopped immediately. I am grateful to Mrs. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and to all European leaders who support visa restrictions for Russian citizens. And we must remember: in addition to the moral side of the issue, it is also a matter of elementary security. Russia has repeatedly sent killers to Europe under the guise of ordinary tourists. They have already admired enough the spire in Salisbury, German streets and warehouses with weapons in the Czech Republic. Enough. Europe is not a place for promenade for murderers and those who support them. The second important piece of news is the IAEA report. The mission, which visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, presented a documentary summary of its work. The report notes the presence of Russian military equipment on the territory of the NPP, emphasizes pressure on our nuclear specialists, and makes clear references to the Russian military occupation. That's good. As for IAEA Director General Grossi's proposal to create a protection zone at the plant, we need to look at the specific content of such an instrument: what exactly can be the protection? If the content of this proposal is to demilitarize the territory of the nuclear power plant - and this is logical, as it was the Russian military presence that put the Zaporizhzhia plant on the brink of a radiation disaster - then we can support such a demilitarized protection zone. In any case, I believe that modern international organizations need a much broader mandate for their actions. I believe that the world not only deserves, but also needs the representatives of the IAEA to force Russia to demilitarize the territory of the NPP and return full control to Ukraine. If Russia puts the world on the brink of a radiation disaster, the world must have adequate means to put Russia in the conditions where the terrorist state will be forced to stop the terror. I took part in a number of important economic events in New York today - our government delegation led by First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko is there. Resistance to Russian terror and protection of our state take place at different levels. Defense goes hand in hand with diplomatic efforts, information work and, of course, the economy. Saving and creating new jobs in Ukraine, attracting investments and business projects, expanding logistics capabilities, protecting our needs for financial assistance - all this is absolutely necessary. And it is necessary now - when the war is still ongoing. One of the most famous stock exchanges in the world, the New York Stock Exchange, is one of the best places to attract the world's economic attention to Ukraine. And today was a Ukrainian day at the stock exchange. And this Ukrainian day started a global campaign to promote our economic potential. We will do everything to ensure that the world's leading businesses work with Ukraine and in Ukraine. It is obvious that the key challenge here is security. We are constantly improving our ability to respond to this challenge - to protect our state and our people. Today I want to thank the warriors who distinguished themselves in this. Five out of six Russian Kh-101 missiles were shot down only in the first half of the day. This is an expensive loss for Russia - and it saved many Ukrainian lives. Four of these missiles were shot down by servicemen of the Air Command South. Well done, guys! Also, special thanks today to the warriors of the 79th airborne assault brigade, who heroically repel the enemy in the Donetsk direction. By the way, today I want to address all our people who create an information picture - in one way or another. Please draw your attention and the attention of society to the fact that the fierce confrontation continues almost along the entire frontline. This is one thousand three hundred kilometers of active hostilities. And it is simply unfair, when there are a lot of talks about certain areas of the front, while others seem to be forgotten. Although our warriors in many directions are doing an absolutely great job, they are absolute heroes. In Donbas, in the Kharkiv region, in the Zaporizhzhia region, in the south, in the border regions of the north and east of the country. The defense of the whole state needs equally sincere and serious attention. I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief - we are solving all issues related to the advance of our Armed Forces and the destruction of the occupiers as quickly and accurately as possible. 50,000 Russian lives have already been lost in this completely senseless war for Russia. And the occupiers do not care about even such a level of losses. And we do care about every life of our heroes, our defenders. We do everything to protect the lives of Ukrainians. And I am grateful to the partners who help us with this. Today, my diplomatic day began at 8 am - with a conversation with Mrs. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives. As always, productive and very warm. We coordinated our steps to protect Ukraine and freedom as such from Russian aggression. In the afternoon, I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte about increasing sanction pressure on Russia, about new defense and macro-financial assistance to our country. I am very grateful. I have just had a conversation with the new Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mrs. Liz Truss. It was her first conversation in her new status with a foreign leader - and it is a great honor for Ukraine. I congratulated Mrs. Prime Minister on the beginning of her work and I feel that we will be able to build a profound and productive relationship. Mrs. Prime Minister takes office at a time of great difficulties. Russian energy blackmail, constant efforts of the terrorist state to destabilize the political situation in Europe and the free world, constant Russian disinformation... However, by maintaining our unity and working in full coordination, we can overcome this, too. We have discussed how to further increase the pressure on Russia, so that the price of aggression for it would constantly increase. And so that the defense support for our state would also constantly increase. I’ve heard very important words about our cooperation, future security guarantees for Ukraine, and about the reconstruction of our state. It is very important that Great Britain retains a leadership role in consolidating the free world and protecting freedom. I invited the Prime Minister to visit our country. And I am thankful for the firm confidence that Ukraine and the free world will definitely win in this war started by Russia. I am grateful to everyone who protects Ukraine and freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! From now on, every year on September 7, Ukraine will celebrate Military Intelligence Day - a professional holiday of people whose contribution to our defense and future victory cannot be overestimated. Previously, we did not have such a holiday specifically at the state level, although military intelligence officers usually received congratulations on this day. I signed a decree that brings this day to a proper level. In the morning, I congratulated our intelligence officers, thanked them for their service, thanked Kyrylo Budanov, Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, for the results Ukraine needs. Presented state awards to the best intelligence officers. And I believe that I will repeatedly award representatives of the intelligence community of Ukraine for their achievements, for operations that continue constantly, and for successes that help our Armed Forces and the entire state move towards the liberation of our entire land. This week we have good news from the Kharkiv region. Probably, you all have already seen reports about the activity of Ukrainian defenders. And I think every citizen feels proud of our warriors. It is a well-deserved pride, a right feeling. Now is not the time to name the settlements to which the Ukrainian flag returns. But it's time to say thank you to the 25th airborne brigade, the 92nd separate mechanized brigade and the 80th airborne assault brigade for their bravery and heroism shown during combat missions. I also express gratitude today to the 406th separate artillery brigade for the extremely successful hits in the areas where the occupiers are concentrated in the south of our country and to the 60th separate infantry brigade, which consistently advances our positions. Each success of our military in one direction or another changes the general situation along the entire frontline in favor of Ukraine. The more difficult it is for the occupiers, the more losses they have, the better the positions of our defenders in Donbas will be, the more reliable the defense of Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and the cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region will be, the faster we will be able to liberate the Azov region and the entire south. I want to say one more thing today - it is very important and very sensitive. This applies to Ukrainians held captive by the occupiers. At the level of Ukrainian intelligence and other involved structures and people, we are constantly trying to achieve the liberation of our prisoners of war. This work never stopped. And the active actions of our defenders also mean the possibility of capturing a sufficient number of enemies to encourage the exchange and release of Ukrainian prisoners of war. I emphasize: we remember all our people held captive by the occupiers. An important decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine was made today. Sanctions have been applied to 606 individuals who belong to the ruling elite of Russia. 28 members of the Security Council of Russia, 154 members of the Federation Council of Russia, 424 deputies of the State Duma of Russia. They are all responsible for this war, for the terror against our people. And none of them will avoid responsibility - it's only a matter of time. We have already taken some of the necessary legal, diplomatic and political steps for this responsibility for them. We also take all other steps deliberately. Today, an important operation was carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine - regarding the activities of some persons subject to sanctions on the territory of our country. I have repeatedly emphasized: there will be no place for smugglers and criminal networks in Ukraine. It seems that some of them did not understand. Well, they will understand. The customs officials who helped the smugglers, including the leadership, have been removed from office and will receive a legal response for all their illegal actions. As for those persons subject to sanctions, who also have foreign citizenship, in particular Russian and Romanian, based on the proposal of the Security Service of Ukraine and in accordance with the norms of the current legislation, I made a decision to terminate the Ukrainian citizenship of these persons. I’ve held a meeting with the head of the government, the minister of finance, the relevant deputy head of the Office regarding the draft budget for the next year. It is clear that this will be the budget of a warring country. Government officials will present the parameters of the project, but I will now mention some important points - politically important points. First. More than a trillion hryvnias will be allocated to the security and defense sector next year. That will be priority number one. Second. Social obligations must be provided in full. In particular, I want Ukrainian pensioners to hear me: next year, as well as this year, the government is tasked with indexing pensions for all our pensioners. Third. To withstand this period and ensure financial and social stability, it is necessary to reduce as much as possible all non-critical expenses of the state, all that does not help defense, does not help the economic development of the country, social and cultural provision of our people. Accordingly, the government should present a program to reduce expenditures on the state enterprises, on the apparatus, on the institutions that do not meet the needs of this special time. I am waiting for proposals from government officials. Fourth. This is the intensification of economic relations. The lending program \"5-7-9%\" is maintained. There will also be other programs and solutions that should help businesses work, save jobs and attract new employees. And fifth. A special recovery fund will be established, which will be filled, in particular, at the expense of confiscated Russian assets. I expect that the draft budget will be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on time, as required by law. I spoke today with German Chancellor Scholz. Many topics: the responsibility of the terrorist state, the further strengthening of the defense capabilities of Ukraine, and the financial support for our state. I thanked Mr. Chancellor for confirming the €5 billion macro-financial aid from the European Union. This is an important decision. A decision that will enable us to support Ukrainians and provide social payments for our people. I also thank the European Commission and all our partners in the EU for this financial package. The provision of another three billion euros is being discussed, we are waiting for the format of the decision. The implementation of the grain export initiative, which is an important tool for our economy and for all partners of our state, continues. Ukrainian food was exported to three continents. To Africa, Asia and Europe. In detail, 54 vessels have already been sent to Asia, 16 vessels have already been sent to Africa, 32 vessels have already been sent to Europe, and part of this volume, by the way, is again sent to Asian and African countries afterwards. Today Russia voiced another blatantly false statement that the absolute majority of Ukrainian grain is allegedly exported to European countries. Well, words of truth have not been heard at the official level in Russia for a long time, and this does not surprise anyone. By the end of this month, at least 3 million tons of agricultural products can be exported from our seaports. And a significant part is for the poorest and most needy countries. In particular, the first cargo was delivered to Ethiopia. The route was not easy: first by sea, then by trucks. But hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians are actually saved from starvation. Perhaps Russia is not OK with this and does not want to notice it. However, this is exactly what the world needs. It is necessary to save countries on different continents from chaos, it is necessary to save people from starvation. Unlike Russia, we do not make a racist division of the world into those who deserve security and those who supposedly do not, into those who deserve to live without famine and those who supposedly do not. We support all people, all countries. Both those who help us and those who still refrain from helping us. Both those that are more stable and those that are less stable. I emphasize once again: Ukraine was, is and will be the guarantor of world food security. I am thankful to everyone who defends our country! I am thankful to each of our partners who help us fight for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! It is with deep sadness that I learned of the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. A great loss for all of Europe, for the world. On behalf of the people of Ukraine, I extend condolences to the Royal Family, the entire United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken paid a visit to Kyiv today. We held negotiations very useful for both our countries, as we are making a common cause, defending freedom. I thanked the Secretary of State for his personal role in helping us; President Biden – for the decisive and effective leadership; the US Congress – for the unwavering bipartisan and bicameral support, and every American – for their sincere understanding of our struggle. We have President Biden's decision on a new $675 million defense aid package. It was also announced that Ukraine will receive more than a billion dollars from the general package of support for European democracies. Each of these steps of our partners has a real impact on the strength of our state and the whole of Europe in defense against Russian terror. As always, the range of topics at the negotiations with Mr. Secretary of State was wide. We discussed political cooperation, our interaction in the financial sphere - macroeconomic support is now as important as support with weapons and ammunition. Of course, attention was paid to the Fast Recovery Plan and, in general, to the reconstruction of Ukraine after the Russian strikes. I’ve raised the issue of officially designating Russia a terrorist state. The legal reality must always correspond to the actual reality. And it is a fact that Russia has become the biggest source of terrorism in the world. You can choose one or another format of procedures, one or another formula of legal pressure against Russia for terror, but the world must receive an unequivocal signal that Russian terror will not be forgiven. I continue to establish new ties for Ukraine - I had a conversation with the President-elect of Kenya, the first conversation in the history of relations between our states. I congratulated him on winning the elections, and we agreed to enhance cooperation. We also talked about overcoming the food crisis - we are doing everything for this. Just today, four ships with agricultural products for Asian countries left our ports. At these hours, more than 65 thousand tons of wheat enter the port of Sudan for unloading. Yesterday, a bulker with wheat departed for Kenya - more than 50 thousand tons. Vessels for Lebanon and Libya are now being loaded in Odesa. In the Pivdennyi Port, a ship bound for India is waiting to be loaded... That is, the geography of Ukrainian agricultural exports by sea is very broad. Literally every working day of the grain export initiative refutes Russian lies about it. Ukraine supplies agricultural products to consumers from different continents. And it is our supply that guarantees food security at the global level. I held a new meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. First of all, regarding our active actions on the frontline. Within the ongoing defense operations, our heroes have already liberated dozens of settlements. And today this movement continued, there are new results. In total, more than a thousand square kilometers of our territory have been liberated since September 1. I am grateful to everyone who made it happen! I am grateful to the army, intelligence officers, and special services for every Ukrainian flag that has been hoisted these days. We listened to the reports of the commanders of operational areas at the meeting today, there are certain decisions. The Staff will continue its work in the format of such fairly frequent meetings, so that our commanders on the ground have full support at all levels and so that the Armed Forces of our country, intelligence and the entire defense and security sector receive all the necessary resources, all the necessary material, political, information, diplomatic and any other means for the effective defense of Ukraine and the expulsion of the occupiers. All state activity is focused on the needs of the front and protection of our people. I am grateful to all Ukrainian warriors, to all those who fight for freedom for our people - both in the south and in the east, those participating in the battles at the front and those who contribute to our victory with respective operations in the rear of the enemy. The liberation of our land is the merit of everyone who clearly and timely fulfills the general defense plan. And I especially want to thank today the fighters of the 115th separate territorial defense brigade of the Operational Command \"North\", who distinguished themselves with bravery and the necessary results for Ukraine in the battles in February-March, when they stopped the advance of the enemy, and who continue to defend our state in the north direction. I am also grateful to the fighters of the 117th separate territorial defense brigade operating in the direction of Sudzha - Sumy, and the 1st tank brigade, which is firmly holding its position in the direction of Gomel - Horodnya. We remember all the threats, we thank all our heroes. I want to once again call on those who inform the society, who comment on the military situation: please analyze the whole picture, express gratitude and support to all our defenders, do not forget about any of them. Eternal glory to all those who stood up for the defense of Ukraine! Eternal glory to our indomitable people! Ukraine is and will be free! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! We have good news from the European Union. The provision of EUR 5 billion of macro-financial assistance to our state has been approved. It's very important. And secondly, there is a decision of the Council of the EU to suspend the visa facilitation agreement signed by the EU and Russia. This decision will be effective from Monday. And there are specific recommendations of the European Commission regarding visa restrictions for citizens of Russia. This is the protection of Europe, it will make it difficult for those who do not want to change anything, do not want to fight against the war, but just want to consume and have fun, as if nothing is happening in Europe, as if there is no Russian terror. United Europe is the second target for Russia after our state, our independence. And it is right that Europe defends itself. Today in Kyiv, I discussed this topic with our friends – the President of Latvia and the Prime Minister of Poland, who arrived on a visit. Of course, the recommendations at the pan-European level are very important. However, there is legal scope to go further to do more. As the Baltic states and Poland did. A terrorist state can hardly be regarded as a source of tourism or any business visits. We also talked today about our bilateral cooperation with EU countries. In particular, this concerns the mitigation of procedures at our border. We must remove the barriers that still hinder our citizens and companies. Peoples who together defend European freedom should be as close as possible. It is known that there are certain difficulties and queues at the Ukrainian-Polish border. I discussed this with the Polish Prime Minister today – we agree on how to solve this problem. The Prime Minister of Ukraine and his Polish counterpart will agree on all technical details. So today, we discussed the issue of joint customs control, expansion of border crossing points, facilitation of postal exchange between Ukraine and the EU countries - I turned to Mr. Prime Minister of Poland with a proposal to lower the price of postal items. This is important for our people, for everyone who needs special support now. And one more important aspect: Poland asked us to help in the energy sector, in particular with the export of electricity. Of course, we will provide it. We will always help the Polish brothers who have been helping us since the first day. Two more plaques appeared on our Alley of Courage in Kyiv today – with the names of Mr. Levits, the President of the Republic of Latvia, and Mateusz Morawiecki, the head of the Polish government. We will gradually note all the leaders of politics, culture, sports and business, who personally visited Kyiv during the most difficult half-year from February 24 to August 24, and personally participated in the defense of our state. Today, I had the honor of presenting state awards to representatives of the media who were honored on the occasion of Independence Day this year. These are reporters, operators, producers, editors, and presenters... They all made a significant contribution to our victory in the media confrontation with Russia, to break through Russian propaganda and spread simply the truth about the war, about our independence. A moment of silence was observed for representatives of the media whose lives were taken by this war. As of today, they are 38 people – not only citizens of our country, but also foreigners who came to Ukraine for the truth and died from Russian weapons. Our army, intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine continue active actions in several operational areas. They continue successfully. I want to once again appeal now to some bloggers, who are sometimes in a hurry to announce the results of certain active actions of our troops on the front lines... Please do not hurry with the reports, do not complicate the task for our army with your haste. Please do not report the specific details of the defense operation earlier than the official representatives of our state will say about it. At this time, the Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated and took control of more than 30 settlements in Kharkiv region. In part of the villages of the region, actions to check and secure the territory continue, we are gradually taking control of new settlements - everywhere we are returning the Ukrainian flag and protection for all our people. I am asking Ukrainians from the liberated territory: please give the representatives of our forces any information known to you about the crimes of the occupiers on Ukrainian land. Units of the National Police are returning to the liberated settlements of Kharkiv region. And I want to thank today our intelligence, our secret services, who once again showed themselves very effectively in throwing the enemy out. Many thanks to the soldiers of the 14th separate mechanized brigade named after Prince Roman the Great – the commander in the Kharkiv direction especially noted the heroic actions of the guys from this brigade. We do not forget about other directions. Fierce battles continue both in Donbas and in the south of our country. I'm thankful to the Marines of the 503rd Battalion for their courage in Donetsk region. My thanks to the intelligence of the 131st Separate Reconnaissance Battalion who, risking their lives, are the first to come forward and ensure the performance of the assigned tasks by the combined military units in Kherson region. I'm thankful to all our boys and girls, men and women who are fighting for Ukraine! I signed new decrees on awarding our soldiers. 293 combatants were given state awards. And today in Kyiv I held a meeting with Haluk Bayraktar - a person whom Ukrainians do not need to introduce. The context of the meeting is clear, and the results will be clear. We are strengthening our state. I presented Mr. Bayraktar with the Order of Merit of first class – it was truly deserved. Glory to everyone who helps us! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! First of all, today I want to congratulate two of our cities, beautiful, strong cities, on their day – Lyman and Dnipro. Lyman in Donetsk region is still waiting for our flag, and this is inevitable – Ukraine always returns. We demonstrate it well. The entire Donetsk region will be liberated, will be safe and happy again, as it should be in Ukraine, as it should be everywhere on our land. The Armed Forces of Ukraine and all those who defend our state, the Special Operations Forces, our intelligence, special services, the National Guard, the police will restore peace in every corner of our state, where Russia has brought only grief and suffering. There will be peace. Peace goes together with the Ukrainian flag, together with our defenders. Dear residents of Dnipro! Your city has done so much for Ukrainian defense both since 2014 and since February 24 that the history of our victory is also the history of Dnipro, it is undoubtedly well deserved. The health and lives of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers were saved in Dnipro. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians received shelter and help in Dnipro during the war years. The front has always felt and still feels the support of the people of Dnipro. I thank you all for this! And I wish you all, as well as all Ukrainians, one thing – the fastest possible victory. I held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Headquarters today. Reports on the situation on the front lines from the commanders of operative areas were presented. The necessary decisions were made. We discussed support of our military. We listened to the report of Defense Minister Reznikov on the results of the meeting at Ramstein Air Base. Thanks to our partners for their support! The movement of our soldiers in different directions of the front continues. As of now, as part of active actions since the beginning of September, about 2,000 kilometers of our territory have already been liberated. These days, the Russian army is showing its best – showing its back. And, in the end, it is a good choice for them to run away. There is and will be no place for the occupiers in Ukraine. However, I emphasize once again: if any of the Russian troops or security forces men are afraid to return to Russia now, we guarantee that everyone who is detained by our soldiers will be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. I spoke today with French President Macron. I briefed him on our activity at the front, about further prospects. We discussed Russian provocations at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and the need for immediate demilitarization of the plant and the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from there. I also talked with Mr. President about increasing defense support of our country, about increasing pressure on Russia, in particular about sanctions pressure, about visa restrictions for citizens of the Russian Federation. The arrangements reached during yesterday's agreements with Head of the Polish government Morawiecki were developed at a meeting devoted to the issues of support for our Polish brothers during this autumn and winter, our energy cooperation with Poland, as I promised him. I instructed to speed up the reconstruction of the power transmission line from the Khmelnytsky NPP to the Polish city of Rzeszów – the first Savior City. Thank you, Rzeszów. Let me remind that this special title was awarded to Rzeszów back in the spring for extremely important assistance to Ukraine. We must complete this reconstruction by December 8 and provide Poland with the necessary amount of electricity. Of course, all this is possible only if Ukraine maintains normal control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. We are working on the international solutions required for this. I also instructed the Cabinet of Ministers to work out the possibility of an urgent supply of 100,000 tonnes of thermal coal to Poland right now. We currently have sufficient volumes for ourselves and can help our brothers prepare for this winter. Today, I welcomed the delegation of UK parliamentarians who arrived in Kyiv. Their negotiations with Head of the Office Andriy Yermak took place – they were very substantive. Among the most important things are security guarantees for Ukraine, our interaction with the UK, as well as the possibilities of our coordination in such regions as, for example, Latin America. We must continue expanding our anti-war coalition. Today, I had a very interesting and useful meeting with Timothy Snyder, a well-known historian, Professor at Yale University and a great friend of Ukraine. Mr. Snyder did a lot to make our country, our people, and our history known and understood in the world. His books are well known to Ukrainian and international readers. And soon there will be another book, he is preparing it now. I was pleased to share some memories of both February 24 and the events of the previous time. We discussed the nature of Russian aggression, propaganda, and the evil that the occupiers are doing. They will definitely be responsible for everything they have done on Ukrainian land. Today, I'm thankful to the soldiers of the 15th Slavic Regiment of the National Guard of Ukraine, who distinguished themselves in the Kharkiv direction. Well done! I'm thankful to the troops of the 214th separate rifle battalion for securing the situation in Balakliya, who, together with units of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Special Operations Forces, special forces of the National Guard and the police, returned full control to the city. I'm thankful to all our defenders, who during these weeks made the approach of the main thing we need – our victory – even more tangible! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear attendees! Mr. President Levits! Dear Mr. Prime Minister of our friends - the Republic of Poland, Mr. Morawiecki! Dear participants and guests of the forum! Dear journalists! I am glad to see you all here at the annual meeting of the Yalta European Strategy. This year, we are meeting at the forum in Kyiv again, but still we are the closest to our Yalta in all eight years of the Kyiv YES period and the most united for the sake of Ukrainian interests in all the years of independence of our mighty state. I think you all have this feeling - even confidence. I think you have a feeling that we are coming back and getting stronger. And I’m asking now all of you who are in this hall to express gratitude with applause to our warriors who are bringing our victory and our return home closer. The path to the return of our entire territory is all there, every day it becomes clearer. We see the contours of restoring the territorial integrity of our state. We know that this is a difficult path, but we know that this difficult path is real and we are doing it. But this is the path. The path, on which there are certain difficult stages, and none of them can be bypassed unfortunately. This is a path that requires bravery – all the time. A path that requires endurance all the time as well. A path on which we cannot allow the weakening of our unity, both within the state and the unity of our global anti-war coalition. This is the path from the Kharkiv region, where people who have been under occupation for months are now greeting the Ukrainian soldiers with tears of happiness... The path to those cities and villages of ours that are still waiting strenuously, and also many with tears, because they are living people, for the return of the Ukrainian flag, and therefore, the return of freedom, security, a chance for the future. We cannot afford to stop. This is my main message to anyone out there who is thinking about something. Even to some of the leaders that are pushing us somewhere, into someone's inappropriate embrace. No, we cannot afford to stop. The path from this time, when the whole state is fully focused and united for the sake of victory, to that special moment when we will finally be able to feel that the victory has taken place. I know the key question on everyone's mind right now is when? When will we pass this path? When will the victory come? The answer to this question can be given by the stage that is right ahead of us. I speak frankly: it will be a difficult stage. We have to endure this winter. I don't want to talk in ephemeral numbers, just some words, I'm talking about specifics. This will be the most difficult winter in the whole world. These will be 90 days that will be a test for our faith in victory. A test for our endurance and unity, for our ability to protect ourselves, the whole world, freedom and fundamental values for any person in the world. Russia is doing everything to break the resistance of Ukraine, the resistance of Europe and the world in 90 days of this winter. Because this is what Russia hopes for. This is its last argument. The last one, I am sure of it: the cruelty of the winter period, which is supposed to help when the cruelty of man is not enough. And we must be ready - not to break down, not to split, not to deviate from our path. There are 90 days ahead, which will be more crucial than 30 years of Ukraine's independence. 90 days that will be more crucial than all the years of the existence of the European Union. Winter will determine our future and the risks. We have no doubt in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in our intelligence, in our special services and in all our people - great people of Ukraine in the occupied territory, who are helping Ukrainian warriors liberate our land. But for this to happen, we need specifics - weapons, ammunition, financial and political support, stronger than ever diplomacy, determination at different levels of the world. Therefore, we need the preservation of the unity of our partners and their willingness to help. To help without waiting for us to say that that’s enough. We are grateful for everything you have done, but there will not be enough for victory until there is victory. We have no doubt that we can get through the winter without Russian energy resources. Not only Ukraine, but all reputable European states. But for this to happen, you need to be ready to prevent any Russian sabotage - armed or political, and it is very important to prevent disinformation steps by Russia. And therefore, we need even more coordination, firmness, and pressure on Russia. The world must overcome the price crisis, which Russia is trying to exacerbate with various of its well-known tools - it destabilizes markets, provokes hunger, intimidates people, ordinary people, intimidates them in various countries. And it is possible to protect yourself from this price crisis only through the complete dismantling of Russian influence - influence on European societies, on world markets and on the global information space. It is an ambitious, complex goal, it exists, it is alive, but it is necessary to complete the dismantling of Russian influence now in preparation for winter - before the crucial 90 days. During the autumn, it is necessary to strengthen sanctions on Russia, officials, banks, and companies as much as possible. You know all this. It is necessary to agree on all mechanisms for real limitation of Russian export income. It is necessary to provide all the legal and political bases for the implementation of an international compensation mechanism and the confiscation of Russian assets abroad to compensate for the losses caused by this war to the people of Ukraine. Maximum visa restrictions for the citizens of the Russian Federation are needed to encourage them to launch a visible anti-war movement. Not just populism, but a noticeable movement, noticeable courage. And also the blocking of Russian propaganda and the deportation of all propagandists from all democratic countries - so that Russia does not even have a chance to sow political and social chaos. Chaotization, splits, discord are Russia's bet, the bet in their bloody casino, the bet there and then, where and when it cannot use conventional weapons. We must prepare our societies, they must know the truth, for the existing risks. The winter will be difficult for everyone - from Latvia and Poland to Britain and the United States. War is war. It is in the world. Winter will be hard. But we can make this winter the most difficult for Russia, for the one who is responsible for all the created problems - military, social, price problems, energy problems and many others. We can make the path to our victory clearer after these 90 days. Although different societies will have a hard time in the winter, each society should know that after these 90 days, real security begins for decades from all those threats that are so painfully experienced now. When we endure all this, our neighbor will never be able to do anything to all of us. Russia has already embarked on the path of its historic defeat - and the clarity of this path, the contours of its defeat will become obvious after these 90 days. If we are all honest and persevere. All who value peace more than war. Ukrainians, Europeans, the whole world. We see how the countries of our continent are now preparing for the winter. These restrictions are complex - restrictions on energy consumption, restrictions on temperatures in homes for the heating season. The EU already did a lot to protect itself when Russia triggered this energy price shock, and today only 9 percent of gas is supplied to EU countries from Russia. And be sure that Russia will make zero gas supplies, and our energy systems must be fully prepared for this. Every day we try to do everything necessary to protect our sky. This is even more important in the winter, when Russian missiles can and will target enterprises and infrastructure that provide people with heat and electricity. Now is the time for partners to fulfill their promises to help Ukraine with air defense systems. Now is the time to end the Russia-created crisis at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The threat of a radiation disaster is definitely not what the European Union, Turkey and other states - those in the directions of the wind that can spread radiation pollution - should enter the winter with. But something else is also important - the stable operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the framework of the Ukrainian energy system can become one of the key, important elements of guaranteeing stable energy consumption by Europe during these 90 days. We already export electricity to our neighbors, which helps replace dirty Russian energy resources, and we can easily increase exports to at least two and a half gigawatts, and eventually even more. Today we talked about it with the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland - they want it, we want it. So we will do it. But for this, it is necessary to ensure that the Russian troops withdraw from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. This is a fundamental European interest now, at this time before winter. Ladies and Gentlemen! When I said that we cannot afford to stop, I did not mean only our heroic warriors who are liberating the Ukrainian land. Now there is a change in the geopolitical configuration in the world as a whole, in Europe. And economic unification in Europe has been achieved. I believe that political unification in Europe has been achieved. This is all obvious at the level of institutions, relations, and everyday life. But now a real value-based unification of the entire continent is being achieved - and, by the way, thanks to Ukraine as well. The last barriers that existed between European countries are disappearing - and this is thanks to the fact that Europe really protects freedom. Europe is gaining real independence. Russia creates the illusion that Europeans must make a choice - such a difficult choice between prices and values, between freedom and security, between independence and peace. But there is no such choice. It is an impossible choice. When values are weak, prices are sky high. When freedom suffers, there is no security. When independence is lost, peace is impossible. Therefore, we must not deviate from our path, we have no right to get tired, God forbid, of Ukraine and stop. All of us - all Ukrainians and all of us Europeans. We must fight. Endure the winter. Help those who are weaker. Protect those who need protection more. Limit ourselves in what can be limited. And limit Russia in everything that should limit it. Give warmth to those whom Russia wants to leave without warmth. And give food to those who are forced by Russia to starve. Continue to fulfill the three fundamental conditions for achieving peace - weapons, ammunition, finances. Support for Ukraine in the war must be maintained. And one more important element. Completing the unification of Europe is impossible without Ukraine. Therefore, this winter we must do absolutely everything to say in the spring: we are fully ready to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union. It will be a historic moment, a historic time - when it will be an honor for Europe to welcome our state. The state that wins. Believe in victory! Defend Ukraine! Help our heroes! And we will definitely endure the winter! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Fellow Ukrainians! Today is 200 days of our resistance. Our struggle. Our people’s war. For freedom, for independence, for the right to be. In these 200 days, we have achieved a lot, but the most important, and therefore the most difficult, is ahead. And I want to dedicate this address to those who are ahead. Who are having the hardest time now, as they are doing the most important thing. These are all defenders of Ukraine. All those who have been courageously standing for 200 days, being the exact reason why Ukraine stands. Strong, and that is why we are free. Unbreakable, and that is why we are independent. Our fighters, who heroically restrained the enemy, and now they do not restrain themselves. And they drive the occupiers out in the north, south and east. In all directions, but moving in only one direction - forward and towards victory. 200 days of Ukrainian resistance. Almost 5 thousand hours. Almost 300 thousand minutes. Almost 20 million seconds. And just as many reasons to say \"thank you\" today to everyone who made this possible. Millions of times. Without any \"almost\". To say that we believe in them, believe in their victory. Without any \"almost\". These are all our warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ground troops, our infantry. You know better than anyone else: there is little romance in war and a lot of hard work. These days, it is courageously and selflessly performed by our separate mechanized brigades. The 92nd – named after Kish otaman Ivan Sirko. The 54th – named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa. The 14th – named after Prince Roman the Great. The 60th Inhulets separate infantry brigade. Step by step in the Kharkiv region, Kherson region, Donbas, with weapons, shovels, hands, teeth – you are \"gnawing away\" every meter, every frontier, every city and village of ours. These are our tank troops. Those who forge the future victory in iron gloves. And today, on the day of the professional holiday, as well. These are the 3rd, 4th, 5th separate tank brigades, tank regiments and battalions, tank companies within the airborne assault troops, the 17th separate Kryvyi Rih tank brigade named after Kostiantyn Pestushko. And especially - the 1st separate tank Siversk brigade. I sincerely congratulate all of you and everyone involved on Tanker's Day. These are our missile troops and artillery. You are rightfully called the \"gods of war\". You send the occupiers to the divine trial. You send the demons back to hell. Today, the 406th separate artillery brigade named after brigadier-general Oleksiy Almazov is doing this with special fervor and spark in their eyes. We are grateful to its fighters and in general to everyone whom we warmly call \"our arta\". How would one describe your jewelry work in two words? Accurate and loud. We thank you for every \"accurate\" and every \"loud\". For all destroyed enemy convoys, warehouses, bases and headquarters. Important crossings and bridges. Where your efforts cause fire and where the enemy violated the rules of fire safety. People online wish you accurate calculations and new hits, and they address the occupiers in a language they understand: \"Stop smoking everywhere. Smoke where there hasn’t been a hit yet\". These are our Air Forces. Bombing, assault, fighter, reconnaissance, military transport aviation. Defending Ukraine you are always on top. These are our Airborne Assault Troops. You are always the first! Because it is no one but you! These slogans are not just words. The enemy has been aware of this for eight years and 200 days. And today, the occupiers especially feel the strength and power of the 79th airborne assault brigade, the 25th and 80th airborne brigades. In particular, in the Kharkiv region, which you are successfully liberating from the enemies. And in the Donetsk region, where you are successfully repelling the enemy. We are sure: in both areas there will be one finale - your victory. For this, one doesn’t need to read forecasts, it is enough to read your oath. You are the paratroopers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. You will never accept defeat. You will never retreat in the face of difficulties. You will never leave your brothers-in-arms in danger. You are always ready to destroy the enemies of Ukraine in battle. You are the paratroopers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine! These are our Naval Forces. You proved that it doesn't matter what fleet the enemy has, what flagship he has, when Neptune is on your side. Guards of native shores. Missile boats, artillery, minesweeping and landing craft, naval aviation, naval artillery and, of course, marines. And I especially want to note the 503rd separate battalion of the marines. On your chevrons there is an inscription: \"If this is an offensive, this is us.\" In our hearts there are words: if this is you, this is success and victory. These are the air defense troops of Ukraine. Anti-aircraft missile troops, radio engineering troops, air defense of the Ground and Naval Forces. You hear an air raid alert differently than most. Most descend into shelter. You direct your gaze upwards to destroy enemy missiles, aircraft, helicopters and drones. This is our intelligence. For obvious reasons, very few people know your names, your faces. Your operations are not usually written about in the news, but they will definitely be written about in military science textbooks. Your successes are often quiet and imperceptible to our people, but always painful and tangible to our enemy. These days, intelligence officers are especially showing themselves. The 131st separate reconnaissance battalion of military intelligence of Ukraine. Those who are always ahead. I thank you, I thank all the units of the Main Intelligence Directorate and all our intelligence officers, thanks to whom we always see, always hear, always know, always act. And we will definitely win. These are our special forces, Special Operations Forces. Those who attack. Those who prevail not in quantity, but in quality. Those who have a special power to fight on the edge of possible and impossible. These are the territorial defense forces. And we especially note the fighters of the separate 115th and 117th territorial defense brigades. These are medical troops that save the lives of our warriors. These are military clergy, chaplains who pray for the lives of our warriors. These are our engineers, communications officers, cyber army. These are those who have been defending and serving the state side by side with the Armed Forces of Ukraine for eight years, for 200 days and right now. I thank all the warriors of the National Guard, its special forces, in particular the 15th Sloviansk regiment. I am thankful to all our border guards. To the officers and employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Police, the State Emergency Service, our firefighters, rescuers, sappers. And altogether - to all our warriors, defenders, the best sons and daughters of Ukraine who are liberating its north, south and east today. To everyone who in 200 days destroyed more than 2,000 enemy tanks, 4,500 armored combat vehicles, more than 1,000 enemy artillery systems, 250 aircraft and 200 helicopters, almost 1,000 drones, 15 ships and boats, thousands of other enemy equipment units. Liberated hundreds of our towns and villages. Who broke the plans of the enemy, because they did not break themselves. All those who held the defense and defended Kyiv. Saved our capital, and thus preserved our faith in our victory. All those who strengthened and multiplied it by protecting Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro. Everyone who defended Mariupol and Azovstal. Liberated the Kyiv region, Zhytomyr region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region. Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Vorzel, Hostomel, Makariv. Okhtyrka, Sumy. And now - Balakliya, Izyum, Kupyansk. All those who liberated, liberate and will liberate all temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Bring back the Ukrainian flag to Kherson, Berdyansk, Melitopol, Luhansk, Horlivka, Yenakijeve, Mariupol and Donetsk, Yalta, Dzhankoy, Kerch, Yevpatoriya, Simferopol. Who have been working 200% all these 200 days. The enemies said that they got lost, that they were going to an exercise. You taught them a lot. The ability to quickly get dressed and get out of our land, and the understanding that, by abandoning equipment and weapons, it can be done much faster and easier. Many of them have forever learned that it is correct to say not \"on Ukraine\" but \"in Ukraine\". I am talking about all those who set foot on our land and stayed in it. Many will forever remember what awaits all uninvited guests in Ukraine. Our warriors. Today, everyone sees and notes your actions in the north, south and east of Ukraine. The world is impressed. The enemy is panicking. Ukraine is proud of you, believes in you, prays for you, and is waiting for you. The path to victory is a difficult one. But we are sure: you are capable of it. You will reach our border, all its sections. You will see our frontiers and the enemies’ backs. You will see the shining of the eyes of our people and of the occupiers’ heels. They will call it \"goodwill gestures\". We'll call it a victory. We believe in you, in those who have been doing their job, risking their lives, defending their country for all these 200 days at -15°C or +35°C, at 2 am or 6 am, on an ordinary Monday or on Independence Day, despite fatigue, tension and danger. All who were definitely ready. Who do not pay attention to rumors and gossip. Who do not read fakes on the Internet, but write the history in real life. The history of independence. The history of victory. The history of Ukraine. Our warriors, our fighters, our defenders. For us, you are definitely the first army of the world. Glory to you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All Europeans! And everyone in the world who believes that terror should have no place on earth. Why is the biggest source of terror in the world - Russia - still able to wage this war? And why can it wage the war so cruelly and cynically? There is only one reason - insufficient pressure on Russia. The response to the terror of this state is insufficient. Just look at what Russia can afford. No other terrorist has ever done this in history - so many things at once. Radiation terror at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Six power units! The presence of Russian troops at the plant, constant Russian provocations and shelling of the plant’s territory alone put Ukraine and all of Europe on the brink of a radiation disaster. Energy terror. Residents of many countries around the world are suffering due to the painful increase in prices for energy resources - for electricity, for heat. Russia does it deliberately. It deliberately destabilizes the gas market in Europe. With its strikes it deliberately limits our Ukrainian ability to export electricity to Europe. The export of electricity from Ukraine could alleviate the severity of the energy crisis in Europe in the same way that the export of our food relieves the severity of the food crisis in the world. Hunger terror is a very cynical and completely deliberate tactic of Russia. And it is directed not just against poor countries, but specifically against those regions of the world from which a new inflow of refugees may come to Europe. Severe migrant crisis in Europe - this is the calculation of the terrorist state. Fortunately, together with our partners, together with the UN, Turkey, we managed to achieve an export grain initiative. Russia was forced to unblock our ports. But now it is threatening a blockade again. And how does the world react? There is still no official recognition of Russia as a state - sponsor of terrorism. Citizens of the terrorist state can still travel to Europe for vacation or shopping, they can still get European visas, and no one knows whether there are torturers or murderers among them who have just returned from the occupied territory of Ukraine. Until now, Russian propagandists can still work precisely in those countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, which are threatened with the greatest chaos due to price and energy crises created by Russia. We are still forced to ask for help in protecting our skies from Russian missiles - after 200 days of full-scale war! Yesterday and today, the Russian army struck the Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians found themselves in the dark - without electricity. Houses, hospitals, schools, communal infrastructure... Russian missiles hit precisely those objects that have absolutely nothing to do with the infrastructure of the Armed Forces of our country. On the one hand, this is a sign of the desperation of those who invented this war. This is how they react to the defeat of Russian troops in the Kharkiv region. They can't do anything to our heroes on the battlefield, and that's why Russia is directing its vile strikes against civilian infrastructure. On the other hand, Russia is trying to prevent us from directing Ukraine's capabilities in such a way as to stabilize the situation in Europe. Our electricity export is something that Russia is very afraid of right now. Because we can disrupt Russian plans to empty the pockets of Europeans this winter due to crazy energy prices. We still need to strengthen our cooperation in order to overcome Russian terror. Russia must be designated a terrorist state. Strengthen sanctions - the eighth EU sanctions package is needed. Increase aid to Ukraine, and above all speed up the provision of air defense systems. I am grateful to all the rescuers who fought the consequences of Russian missile strikes at energy facilities. Hundreds of settlements in several regions of Ukraine were cut off due to these strikes. At the request of the Minister of Internal Affairs, today I would like to especially note the contribution to the stabilization of the situation of Major General of the Civil Protection Service Oleksandr Volobuyev, Colonel of the Civil Protection Service Oleksandr Mislavskyi, Senior Lieutenant of the Civil Protection Service Vitaliy Dzyabko, Ensign of the Civil Protection Service Denys Kostenko and fireman, Ensign Oleksandr Gulyi. Thank you. I am grateful to you and your colleagues! The energy supply of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Poltava region, Sumy region, Kharkiv region and the city of Kharkiv was restored. But today there are new strikes at energy facilities. New blackouts in Kharkiv. And we must be aware that the meanness of Russian terrorists knows no bounds - they will try to make such a form of terror systematic. On my behalf, the Prime Minister of Ukraine held a meeting today with the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Territories and Communities Development of Ukraine, the Ministry of Finance and Naftogaz. A coordinating headquarters will be formed to quickly respond to all such manifestations of Russian terror. Funds will also be allocated for the restoration of damaged objects and for assistance to the de-occupied territories. From the beginning of September until today, our warriors have already liberated more than 6,000 square kilometers of the territory of Ukraine - in the east and south. The movement of our troops continues. I am thankful to the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade, which has recovered from heavy fighting in the east and is advancing very bravely, very confidently in the south direction. I am thankful to the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade for steadily moving forward despite everything - despite the features of the open terrain, despite the artillery of the occupiers. I am thankful to the fighters of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade for the liberation of several settlements and very effective actions to neutralize the enemy's activity. Guys, you are true heroes! Separately, I want to thank our anti-aircraft fighters today. Yesterday, we all saw the consequences of the Russian strikes. But at the same time, most of the terrorists' missiles were shot down. Nine of the twelve missiles were shot down. Seven missiles were shot down by warriors of the 138th Dnipro anti-aircraft missile brigade of the \"East\" air command, and two missiles were shot down by the sky defenders of the 96th Kyiv anti-aircraft missile brigade of the \"Center\" air command. Thank you, our defenders! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who is really ready to fight against Russian terror! We bring victory closer every day. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The participants, as before, are Reznikov, Zaluzhny, Syrsky, Kovalchuk, Litvinov, Yermak, Monastyrskyi, Kubrakov, Danilov, Lebid and others. The first and most important issue is the reports of commanders by direction. Oleksandr Syrsky reported on the successes in the Kharkiv region, Andriy Kovalchuk - on the movement of our troops in the south. We considered the draft budget for defense and security for the next year. The situation in the liberated territory of our state was analyzed in detail. As of now, stabilization measures have been completed in the districts with a total area of more than 4,000 square kilometers. Stabilization continues in the liberated territory of  approximately the same size. Remnants of occupiers and sabotage groups are being detected, collaborators are being detained and full security is being restored. Border guards are tasked with protecting the state border in the liberated territory. Once again, I thank all our fighters who ensured such a large-scale and quick defeat of the invaders in the territory of the Kharkiv region! By the way, today I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 153 combatants were awarded state awards, 12 of them posthumously. All - for bravery in the battles in the east of our country - in the Kharkiv region, in Donbas. It is very important that together with our troops, with our flag, ordinary normal life comes to the de-occupied territory. As an example, in Balakliya, in Hrakove, the payment of pensions for five months at once, for the time when we simply could not make payments due to the occupation, has already been started. And all Ukrainian pensioners in the liberated territory will receive payments. Ukraine always fulfills its social obligations to people. Today I held a meeting with the Defense Ministers of Denmark and Estonia who arrived in Kyiv. Of course, we talked about further support for our state, about further pressure on Russia. I thanked them for the principled and consistent help in protecting people's freedom and life. I held negotiations with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. I thanked her for the allocation of $1.4 billion in additional support for our state. We discussed a new program of cooperation and, in general, the preservation of Ukraine's financial stability. We have a result in our work on security guarantees for our state. Today, a package of recommendations was presented by the international group led by Andriy Yermak and Anders Fogh Rasmussen - these are the recommendations that should form the basis of the future system of security treaties that will give Ukrainians peace of mind and guarantee the prevention of any war against Ukraine. We are working to ensure that the strongest subjects of the free world become guarantors of the security of our state. So that at the multilateral and bilateral level, it is stipulated in detail who, how and when should react in case of any threat to the state security of Ukraine. React with sanctions, arms supply, all the necessary material and financial support. The main thing is clear and legally binding steps, specific and timely actions, in particular, preventive actions aimed at preventing war and cooling the aggressor's intentions. That is, everything that our country did not have before and because of which Russia had the illusion it could go unpunished for the war against Ukraine. Together with our partners, we have already built a powerful anti-war coalition, which includes dozens of different states. And now we are working to ensure that the most powerful states that are already helping us become a coalition of peace that will last forever. I spoke today with Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi. I informed him about the situation on the frontline, about the successes of our state. We always note: in every victory of Ukraine there is also a victory of those who, together with us, defend freedom and European values. Italy is among the strongest. Mr. Draghi and I discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the Russian provocations in great detail. Thank you for understanding that the demilitarization of the ZNPP is a fundamental condition for the return of radiation safety to all of us in Europe. I am grateful to everyone who helps our country expel the occupiers! I am grateful to each of our warriors who do everything to bring victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! I’ve returned from the Kharkiv region - from our Kharkiv region, from the districts that were liberated. As of today, almost the entire region is de-occupied. It was an unprecedented movement of our warriors – Ukrainians once again managed to do what many considered impossible. On the first day of active operations alone, our troops advanced 19 kilometers. 110 kilometers were covered in five days of fighting. In total, almost 400 settlements were de-occupied. The 150,000 Ukrainians who remained in this territory feel again now what an ordinary, safe, normal life is like. The Russian army has been in the Kharkiv region for more than five months. And during this time, the occupiers did not even try to do anything for the people. They only destroyed, only deprived, only took away. They left behind devastated villages, and in some of them there is not a single undamaged house. The occupiers left schools turned into garbage dumps, and churches – broken, literally turned into toilets. Journalists - both Ukrainian and foreign journalists - gained access to the liberated areas. The world must see this destruction, must feel the pain that Russia has brought to Ukrainians. Our law enforcement officers already receive reports of murders, tortures and abductions by the occupiers. What the world saw in Bucha, what we saw in the de-occupied territory of the Chernihiv region, Sumy region, and what we are seeing now in the Kharkiv region are evidence of genocide against Ukrainians. Evidence that Russia cannot bring anything else except for genocide. And I will speak in Russian to \"comrades\". Your missile attacks today, Russian missiles targeting Kryvyi Rih, the dam of the Karachunivske Reservoir, the objects that have no military value at all, in fact hitting hundreds of thousands of ordinary civilians, is another reason why Russia will lose. And not just this war, but history itself. History is written by people, never by savages. Who will you remain in history? All those who launch these missiles. Those who came to our land. Weaklings. You are weaklings waging a war against civilians. Scoundrels who, having fled the battlefield, are trying to do harm from somewhere far away. You will remain terrorists whom their own grandchildren will be ashamed of. Events show that the only way out for Russian soldiers is to surrender to Ukrainian forces. This is the only option that guarantees them life and attitude in accordance with all conventions. Every Russian soldier should have already understood that only in Ukrainian captivity will no one use him as cannon fodder in a war that is obviously losing for Russia. At the site of the missile attack on Kryvyi Rih, everything is being done to eliminate the consequences of this yet another Russian vile act. A vile act, which may please insane Russian propagandists, but will certainly not save the moral and psychological state of Russian soldiers. They understood that the Russian command is incompetent, and that a rout awaits them in Ukraine on all fronts. Russia will not fix this with any terror, as terror only confirms the weakness of the one who resorts to it. Today in Izyum, I awarded our heroes. It was an honor for me to present state awards on this very land to those who liberated this land. I am grateful to the warriors of the 14th and 92nd separate mechanized brigades, the 25th separate airborne brigade, the 80th separate airborne assault brigade - everyone who in just five days forced the enemy to retreat in panic, abandoning equipment, ammunition, numerous Russian flags. I am grateful to the 107th MLRS brigade, the 40th, 43rd, 44th separate artillery brigades, the 26th artillery brigade. I want to thank the 15th separate artillery reconnaissance brigade - all the warriors who ensured the timely destruction of enemy targets and the advance of our ground units. And, of course, I am grateful to the fighters of the Main Intelligence Directorate, all who skillfully turned the enemy's panic into real hysteria. I am grateful to Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrsky and the officers of his staff - everyone who planned and successfully conducted the military operation to liberate the Kharkiv region. The Ukrainian flag will return to all parts of our country. Just like in the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian warriors will be met in Donbas, in the south, and in Crimea. It will happen, it will definitely happen. I also held a meeting today in Kharkiv regarding the energy situation in the city and the region. We take into account the fact that the terrorist state can resort to any new vile acts. All levels of Ukrainian authorities - both central and local, rescue services, energy companies, transporters - are tasked with preparing for any scenarios. Reserves for energy, heat and water supply are needed - for all possible cases. We are preparing for tomorrow's active day. We are waiting for the news from the frontline. There will be diplomatic news from Kyiv - President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen is paying a visit. Today was almost a Ukrainian day in Brussels. For the first time in the history of the European Union, a state from outside the EU was actually represented at a special session of the European Parliament during the annual State of the EU Report - this is our state. So far - from outside the EU. We are working for full membership – politically, legally, symbolically. The First Lady of Ukraine was present during this annual report of the President of the European Commission. We have an important result of this visit - one hundred million euros for the reconstruction of 74 schools in Ukraine in the framework of the Fast Recovery Plan. We will do everything to implement a large-scale social initiative - cancellation of roaming charges for our people in the EU and for Europeans in Ukraine. This will be a strong signal of our rapprochement. And I thank Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, I thank all our friends in the European Union for their unwavering support. I am thankful to all our warriors! I am thankful to everyone who participates in the rescue operations after the Russian strikes. We will respond to the terrorists for each of their vile acts, for each missile, for each projectile. We are capable of that. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today in Kyiv, a new plaque dedicated to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen was unveiled on the Walk of the Brave. It was really a great honor and simply a pleasure for me to take part in this unveiling, in the recognition of Mrs. Ursula's bravery. She is one of the central figures of the European policy towards Ukraine, she is one of those thanks to whom the European space and European values are now really being protected. Today Mrs. Ursula has visited our country for the third time since February 24. And every time her visits open a new stage in the rapprochement of Ukraine and the European Union. We discussed all the key points in our relations. But now I want to highlight the issue of integration, the movement of our country towards full membership in the EU. Whatever the circumstances, we will still implement every detail of our arrangements to open the possibility of membership negotiations. Already in November, we are to fulfill the seven recommendations of the European Commission, which we received when we obtained the candidate status. The assessment by the European Commission of our progress in integration should begin as soon as possible. And next year, we should clarify the key issue: when we can start membership negotiations. The Ukrainian side will do everything for this. And as elements of rapprochement, we consider such things as the regime of the EU internal market for Ukraine, as the unification of our institutional work, for example, at customs - in joint customs control between Ukraine and EU countries. We are already working on this. Today I thanked Mrs. Ursula for the support already provided – macro-financial, sanctions, defense. We also discussed energy cooperation, which is extremely important for Ukraine and for every EU country on the eve of this winter, which Russia will try to use against all of us in Europe. I told about a new and particularly vile tactic of Russian terrorists - attacks on energy and hydrotechnical infrastructure. Just during the stay of the President of the European Commission in Ukraine, the Russian army launched new missile attacks on Kryvyi Rih, on the Kirovohrad region. In both cases - on hydrotechnical structures. The purpose of these strikes is completely clear. These are attacks on people, on the normality of life in Ukraine. The terrorist state is trying to show that it can allegedly compensate with such strikes for the cowardice and incompetence of its military, for the failure of its efforts to avoid sanctions and economic isolation. In response, we must show that there will always be a tough and principled reaction to every manifestation of Russian terror. That is why the eighth EU sanctions package is needed - we talked about it with Mrs. Ursula. A principled decision by the United States of America regarding the terrorist state, the legal recognition of this status is also needed, and we discussed this, by the way, recently during the visit of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Kyiv. We also discuss this issue during contacts with congressmen. Progress is needed in providing Ukraine with air defense systems. We already have agreements with certain countries, our diplomats are working with others. I want to emphasize that without providing us with a sufficient number of sufficiently effective air defense systems that will protect the Ukrainian skies, Russia will continue to feel impunity and provoke new local and global crises. Therefore, protecting Ukraine from Russian missiles is truly a basic element of global security. In general, supporting Ukraine with weapons, ammunition and finances is crucial for peace in Europe. The better support we have, the sooner this war will end. I talked about it with the representatives of the leading think tanks of Poland, Britain, France and the US who arrived in Kyiv. Real protection of freedom and common values of the free world is possible now only as a result of Ukraine's victory in this war. I also spoke about further support for Ukraine with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. As always, very substantive, specific. We discussed various security issues, including Russian missile strikes, defense assistance, training of our military, prospects for the developments on the battlefield, restoration of critical infrastructure before the winter period. I am grateful to Mr. Prime Minister for the support already provided to us, in particular financial, for the funds for the purchase of gas. And for understanding the steps we need to take to ruin Russia's terrorist plans. An important IAEA resolution was adopted today - a resolution demanding that Russia cease all actions against the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant at the plant itself, at any other nuclear facility in Ukraine. Although international organizations are often limited in their ability to respond, we see that the IAEA clearly identifies the source of radiation danger, namely: the Russian military presence at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, Russian actions against the nuclear power plant. Therefore, the complete demilitarization of the plant, the immediate withdrawal of all Russian troops from there is the only thing that can ensure the implementation of this IAEA resolution. And this is also a basic element of global security. As long as Russian soldiers remain at the nuclear power plant, the world remains on the brink of a radiation disaster – worse than even Chornobyl. And it is the joint responsibility of everyone in Europe and the world - to remove the Russian presence from the territory of the ZNPP. Today I want to thank all the representatives of the State Emergency Service, utility services, construction workers, police officers, military personnel, representatives of local authorities, business representatives - everyone who is involved in eliminating the consequences of Russian missile terror, who helps those who suffered from the strikes. In Kryvyi Rih and the Kirovohrad region, in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, in Mykolaiv and the Donetsk region - in all the cities and communities that Russia tortures with its missiles. The terrorist state has already used more than 3,800 different missiles against us. But no missile will bring Russia closer to its goal. There will be no subjugation of Ukraine. And each missile brings Russia closer to greater international isolation, greater economic degradation and even clearer historical condemnation. And finally. A mass burial site was found in Izyum, Kharkiv region. The necessary procedural actions have already begun there. There should be more information - clear, verified information - tomorrow. Tomorrow there will be Ukrainian and international journalists in Izyum. We want the world to know what is really happening and what the Russian occupation has led to. Bucha, Mariupol, now, unfortunately, Izyum... Russia leaves death everywhere. And it must be held accountable for that. The world must hold Russia to real account for this war. We will do everything for this. Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken away by the occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! In Kharkiv region, investigative actions are ongoing in the areas that were liberated from the Russian occupation. All the crimes of the Ruscists are being recorded, evidence of their guilt is being collected. Torture chambers where civilians of occupied cities and towns were abused, premises where people were kept – even foreigners – were found. In particular, seven citizens of the Republic of Sri Lanka, students of the Kupyansk Medical College. Back in March, they were captured by Russian soldiers and subsequently kept these people in the basement. Only now, after the liberation of Kharkiv region, these people were saved, they are provided with proper medical care. Exhumation of bodies continues at a mass burial site near Izium. As of now, more than 440 graves have been found. It is too early to say about the number of people buried there, investigations are ongoing. There is already clear evidence of torture, humiliating treatment of people... Moreover, there is evidence that Russian soldiers, whose positions were not far from this place, shot at the buried just for fun. The world must react to all this. Russia has repeated in Izium what it did in Bucha. And now we have just begun to learn the full truth about what was happening in Kharkiv region at that time. It is good that the UN units are already preparing a group of employees who will visit this place near Izium, who will see and be able to report to everyone in the UN system about what the Russian terrorists did. We will ensure full access of journalists to the liberated territory and all places of human abuse. We will provide access to tell the world that ruscism must be condemned. I thank all our partners, all leaders and just our ordinary people who help fight for justice. Fight for the official recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, for the strengthening of sanctions against Russia for this terror. I held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Headquarters today. As always, key leaders of the defense and security sector, key representatives of the central government, who ensure the implementation of the defense plan, attended it. Commanders of operative forces reported on the situation on the front line. In addition to completely understandable issues and solutions, the topic of advanced weapons, which will significantly strengthen our army, was also touched upon. I spoke today with the President of Finland. I thanked us for the support we have already received and outlined the additional needs we have. An important topic of conversation was the European policy regarding visas for citizens of the terrorist state. I believe that for every country that shares a common border with Russia, the visa issue is vital and should be resolved in favor of a complete restriction of access for Russian citizens. I also spoke today with representatives of the Nike company. I thanked them for the decision to leave the Russian market. The right decision. This is an example of how business can play a significant role in protecting humanity and freedom. If a state chooses the path of terror, it is the duty of every self-respecting company to distance itself from such a state. Today, a meeting of the group led by Andriy Yermak working on Ukraine's accession to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development took place in the Office, a meeting with the G7 ambassadors and other partner states. This is an extremely important direction, which is important both in the context of European integration and in the context of the internal transformation of our state. During the meeting, the diplomats were given the details of our initiative to create an ad hoc international tribunal to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. I'm thankful to the G7 representatives and other partner countries for their willingness to support Ukraine! And one more thing. This Saturday we celebrate Rescuer's Day – a professional holiday of those who dedicated their lives to saving others. And it is also the day of those who, under certain circumstances and thanks to their decency and courage, became a rescuer by helping someone else. Today, I honored such people with state awards. And, of course, tomorrow in the evening address I will say more about it. But I want right now, without waiting for tomorrow evening, to congratulate everyone who performs this noble work, who saves people. I want to thank you for the thousands of saved lives, for the security you are returning to us, all Ukrainians. Eternal glory to all who care about people! Please always help each other, always keep unity in everything. We must stick together, all Ukrainians, and that's how we will win. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Today, several of our cities should celebrate their days – the day of the city. In particular, Kherson and Berdiansk, which still remain under the control of the occupiers. Yet. No matter what forces the occupiers spent on them, no matter what they said there, our Kherson and our Berdiansk never lost their Ukrainian soul, never lost their faith in Ukraine. And we do not forget them for a single moment and will definitely return. Just like Kyiv region, Chernihiv region and Sumy region, just like now Kharkiv region, we will liberate other regions and all our land. Wherever there is Ukraine, there will be our flag and nowhere will this atrocity remain – ruscism that repeats what the Nazis did. They don't make soap out of people, they don't make lampshades out of leather... The scale is not the whole of Europe... But the principle is the same. Camps where people are gathered to kill. Deportations. Burnt cities and villages, completely destroyed – nothing remains alive after ruscism. Missile terror. Mass burials. Executioners. The cruelest torture of people still alive. And the boundless, undisguised hatred with which they justify this war that they started. Exhumation work continued today in Izium, Kharkiv region, at the site of the mass burial that had been found. Examinations of the bodies are being conducted. New evidence of the torture used against the people buried there has been found. More than ten torture chambers have already been found in the liberated areas of Kharkiv region – in various cities and towns. As the occupiers fled, they also dropped the devices for torture. Even at the ordinary railway station in Kozacha Lopan, a room for torture and tools for electric torture were found. It's just a railway station! Torture was a widespread practice in the occupied territory. That's what the Nazis did. This is what ruscists do. And they will answer in the same way – both on the battlefield and in courtrooms. We will identify all those who tortured, who humiliated, who brought this atrocity from Russia here, to our Ukrainian land. The situation on the front line has not undergone significant changes over the past day. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, units of our intelligence, SBU, National Guard are gradually, step by step, pushing the occupiers out of our land. But we still need time, we still need effort, we still need to be fully focused on defense and keep all our strength. Many of the Russian soldiers have already realized that they have no chance in Ukraine, that they will be defeated. The most intelligent of the Russian military are surrendered, and we guarantee them compliance with all rights according to the conventions. And we will continue pressing so that all the occupiers understand this. We will beat them harder than before. I'm thankful to all our soldiers – from commanders to privates! I'm thankful to everyone who helps our defense! I'm thankful to all partners who support the investigation of the crimes of the occupiers and work with us to hold Russia accountable for this war and its consequences! And I thank everyone who helps restore normal life after our heroes liberate our land! Now the liberated areas of Kharkiv region can finally live – food and medicine are delivered, energy supply is restored, pensions have been brought, we are restoring the operation of transport and railways. The time will come – we will also rebuild everything that was destroyed by the occupiers. And there will be a day when I will be able to say this about each of our cities that are still under occupation. And about Kherson, and about Berdiansk, and about Donetsk, and about Luhansk, and about Mariupol. Of course, about Crimea. Ukraine will return. Ukraine will win! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I started this day, as always, with a morning conference call. The Commander-in-Chief, the Minister of Internal Affairs, the heads of intelligence, the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Infrastructure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, the Security Service, the Head of the Office, \"Ukroboronprom\" and some others who are responsible for the most important areas of assistance to our defenders. This is how my day starts. Often - with the same questions, often - with similar answers. And this is always the time for the most important words for Ukraine. Izyum, Balakliya, Kupyansk and the Kharkiv region in general are the cities and communities that we have liberated. These words are heard now. They are heard everywhere. Mariupol, Melitopol and Kherson are also heard, but they will sound even more often and louder when we liberate them. Donetsk, Horlivka and Luhansk - they will be heard as well. Dzhankoy, Yevpatoriya, Yalta - and they will, too. Definitely. We do not talk about what’s not ours. Only our words, Ukrainian words, sound. Every morning, every afternoon, every evening, every night - for 207 days already. They sound thanks to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, thanks to the Special Operations Forces, thanks to the Main Intelligence Directorate, thanks to the Security Service of Ukraine, thanks to the territorial defense, thanks to the border guards and the entire system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs - from the National Guard and the National Police to the rescuers of the State Emergency Service. The most important words that are heard thanks to our medical workers and transporters, thanks to energy workers and volunteers, thanks to fighters of the information front and educators, thanks to diplomats and many others who do their job in a way that makes us all stronger. Strengthens our ability to fight and win. Perhaps it seems to someone now that after a series of victories we have a certain lull. But this is not a lull. This is preparation for the next sequence. For the next sequence of words that are very important to us all and that definitely must be heard. Because Ukraine must be free - the whole of it. And in conclusion, as always, words that sound and will always sound. They are heard by us, they will be heard by our children, they will be heard by our grandchildren. They will be heard in free Ukraine. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief – we meet every time we have significant news from the frontline. The Kharkiv region – we are stabilizing the situation, holding our positions. Firmly. So firmly that the occupiers are panicking tangibly. Well, we warned that the Russian soldiers in Ukraine have only two options: flee our land or surrender. The collaborators have similar options - either they will try to escape, and it remains to be seen whether Russia will let them into its territory, even despite giving them its passports, or the collaborators will be convicted according to the current legislation of Ukraine. By the way, I want to thank the National Police for quickly restoring law and order in the newly liberated territory. And the Security Service of Ukraine – for the fact that it is now working with remarkable effectiveness. I cannot reveal all the details, but thanks to the Security Service of Ukraine, we are now confident that the occupiers will not have any foothold on Ukrainian soil. What’s important: the situation at the state border and the protection of our border were discussed at the meeting. The Head of the State Border Service delivered a report. The state will provide all the necessary power to protect our border. We heard the reports by the Commander-in-Chief, commanders of operative directions. We are very attentive to the provision of our warriors on the eve of the winter. Today I want to thank the warriors of the 54th separate mechanized brigade, who are showing resilience in the defense of the Donetsk region. The 95th airborne assault brigade - for extremely brave actions on liberating our territory. The 59th separate motorized infantry brigade is also doing a great job! In the conditions you are fighting, guys, moving forward steadily is truly heroism! The 57th separate motorized infantry brigade - thank you guys for your strength! Thank you for advancing! The pace is very important now. The pace of stabilization in the liberated areas. The pace of movement of our troops. The pace of restoration of normal life in the liberated territory. And the pace of support from partners. We speak about this honestly - the pace of providing aid to Ukraine should correspond to the pace of our movement. This was also considered today at the meeting. I spoke with Aleksander Čeferin today. I am grateful for the support of our athletes, for unwavering principles. I thanked the UEFA President for his assistance in restarting the Ukrainian Football Premier League. We discussed the opportunities of UEFA to help in the liberation of our athletes - prisoners of war, in providing public support to them. These days, a farewell ceremony for Queen Elizabeth II took place in London. Ukraine honored her memory at a high level - the Prime Minister of Ukraine and the First Lady were present. Among the millions of people who came to pay respects to Her Majesty, there were many Ukrainians. I am thankful to all Ukrainians in the United Kingdom who showed our British friends at this sorrowful moment that Ukraine stands with them. Tomorrow will be a very important day – we are preparing a speech at the UN General Assembly. There will be important signals from our state. I will also take part in the summit on food security – this is a fundamentally important element of global security, and Ukraine has something to say. There will also be online meetings with American partners and investors. We are doing everything to ensure that Ukraine's needs are met at all levels: defense, finance, economy, diplomacy. I am grateful to everyone who helps our country! I am grateful to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! I’ve just taken part in a high-level meeting on food security. This meeting took place within the regular UN General Assembly. The topic of food security is strategically important for our country. This is where we have – and must retain – a global role. This is what gives us economic strength and strengthens our moral leadership. The leadership of people who help others even when they themselves are in extremely difficult circumstances. We participate in the implementation of the UN World Food Programme and help African countries. We have resumed our seaborne agricultural exports, and this enables us to export our agricultural products to countries already on three continents. We are working on opening the markets of Latin America and other important parts of the world for our producers. Tomorrow I will participate in the General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly. Obviously, in a video format. But no matter what the format is, the position of our state will sound, as always, clearly and strongly. Especially since the visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to the United States has already begun, meetings within the UN General Assembly have begun. Olena has already met with the First Ladies of Poland and Lithuania - this is our format of the Lublin Triangle. And she also met nine wives of presidents and prime ministers from different countries at the Ukrainian Institute of America in the framework of the Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen. This is the first such event within our cooperation format. I expect important decisions after the meetings of Prime Minister of Ukraine Shmyhal with the leaders of the states in the framework of the General Assembly. Today I spoke with the American friends of our country within the Clinton Global Initiative. And also with representatives of the leading American investment circles. I felt a great interest in Ukraine, in our reconstruction, in our capabilities. Unequivocal faith in Ukraine. Good knowledge of the situation in our country. We are developing our relations with the US at all levels. I spoke with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. The key topic is security. Head of the Office Andriy Yermak had another conversation with US President's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan today. A very useful, substantive and efficient conversation. We continue stabilization measures in the areas liberated from the Russian occupation. The regular facts of Russian atrocities are recorded - people show where the occupiers had torture chambers, where they hid the bodies of the murdered, testify about who helped the occupiers. I am thankful to all law enforcement officers involved in establishing the truth about the crimes of the occupiers. I am thankful to everyone who helps them. This is a colossal job that is needed for the sake of justice, for the sake of punishing everyone guilty of crimes against Ukrainians. The situation on the frontline clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine. Our defenders very carefully and very bravely fulfill the tasks set by their commanders. Today, I would like to particularly note the 81st separate airborne assault brigade for its courage in liberating settlements in the Donetsk region. And also the 93rd separate mechanized brigade - for the heroic defense of Bakhmut and Soledar. Thank you! Gratitude to all our heroes! Of course, today there is quite high-profile news from Russia. Lots of questions about this. But what actually happened? What did we hear that had not been heard before? Our positions are clear and well known. Only this should interest us. Not what sounds somewhere, but what is our task. More support for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, more support for intelligence, more support for the Special Operations Forces, more support for the Security Service of Ukraine, for the National Guard, for the police, for the border guards - for everyone who is gradually restoring our territorial integrity. Our positions do not change because of the noise or any announcements somewhere. And we enjoy the full support of our partners in this. We inform all subjects of international relations about what is happening. And we see understanding not only from our partners, but also from those states that tried to stay away from our struggle. There will be steps in support of Ukraine in such circumstances from key international associations as well. So let’s maintain the pressure. Let’s preserve unity. Let’s defend Ukraine. We are liberating our land. And we are not showing any signs of weakness. And I thank all friends and partners of Ukraine for today's mass principled firm condemnation of Russia's attempts to stage new sham referenda. Glory to everyone who defends our state! Glory to our beautiful people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear colleagues! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this meeting. Given the meeting is taking place on the margins of the UN General Assembly, I will mention one of the fundamental documents of the modern international legal system. This is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 30 articles about the most urgent things for every person out of the billions of people who have lived, live and will live on our planet. I will now quote Article 25: “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.” This is a very important definition - the definition of the right, not the privilege, the right, not the fortune, the right, not the vagaries of climate. The right to food. The right to protection against hunger. The right! Ukraine considers this right inalienable for all people, for all countries. Every person in the world should be free from hunger and even the threat of it. Every country in the world should be reliably protected from famine. And any state that provokes famine, that tries to make access to food a privilege, that tries to make the protection of nations from famine dependent on the smile of fortune or the mercy of some dictator - such a state must get the toughest reaction from the world. Reaction as for the use of weapons of mass destruction - chemical, biological or nuclear. Because the spread of famine is the same immoral and inhumane weapon of mass destruction as the spread of deadly bacteria or radiation. This is Ukraine's position. This is the position of a nation that has lost millions of people to Holodomors. Therefore, we particularly feel what the words \"food security\" really mean. What the right to protection against hunger is. What the right to food is. We feel why this is not a privilege, why it should not be an accident and why anyone who destroys this right should face a tough response. That is why we are making so much effort to restore our agricultural exports. This is not only an economic issue for us. This is a question of basic values and respect for life as such. In 8 months of last year, Ukraine exported almost 38 million tons of agricultural products. In 8 months of this year, the world market has received almost 10 million tons less already. Minus 10 million tons of our agricultural exports is plus tens of millions of people who found themselves on the brink of starvation or are starving. And these are only the initial consequences of the Russian blockade of our ports, Russian attempts with missile strikes to prevent us from building new export logistics, and the immoral political game with fluctuations in food prices. Russia must bear responsibility for this. Why did it need all this? To supposedly graciously give food in exchange for sovereignty. In exchange for political submission. In exchange for vulnerability. Vulnerability of many African, Asian and European countries. That is why Russia wants to make protection from hunger not a right, but a privilege, and wants to make food - not an inalienable right, but something to beg for. We categorically do not accept that. We consistently fight against that. Even in the conditions of a full-scale war, we help those who cannot provide agricultural products for themselves with our agricultural products. And I want to assure the UN that Ukraine will continue to be a guarantor of the UN World Food Programme. In particular, we are already helping Somalia and Ethiopia. Africa, Asia, Europe, the American continent... Wherever food is needed, we are ready to export and help. And we call for your solidarity. Stand in solidarity with us in holding Russia to account. Stand in solidarity with us in guaranteeing the right of any person and any country to protection from hunger, the right to food. This is a right, not a privilege. It should be so. I believe that we will be able to guarantee it. I am grateful to UN Secretary-General Guterres. I am grateful to Türkiye and President Erdoğan. Our grain export initiative is working steadily. And I am grateful to all Ukrainians - each and every one who turns our ability to guarantee global food security into an objective reality. I thank all of you for your support and attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Greetings to all people of the world who value peace and unity between different and equal nations! I wish you all peace! I thank you that we are united in our striving to restore peace and to guarantee peace for any nation that has become a victim of the armed aggression. A crime has been committed against Ukraine, and we demand just punishment. The crime was committed against our state borders. The crime was committed against the lives of our people. The crime was committed against the dignity of our women and men. The crime was committed against the values that make you and me a community of the united nations. And Ukraine demands punishment for trying to steal our territory. Punishment for the murders of thousands of people. Punishment for tortures and humiliations of women and men. Punishment for the catastrophic turbulence that Russia provoked with its illegal war and not only for us, Ukrainians, but for the whole world. For every nation that is represented in this Hall of the UN General Assembly. I am speaking on behalf of the state, which is forced to defend itself, but has the formula for peace. I am speaking to everyone who wants to hear how to achieve peace. I will present a formula that can work not only for us, but for anyone who may find themselves in similar circumstances as we did. It is a formula that punishes crime, protects life, restores security and territorial integrity, guarantees security, and provides determination. There are five preconditions for peace. Dear Mr. President of the General Assembly! Dear Secretary-General of the United Nations! Dear heads of states and governments! Dear journalists! Nations of the world! Ukraine wants peace. Europe wants peace. The world wants peace. And we have seen who is the only one who wants war. There is only one Entity among all UN Member States who would say now, if he could interrupt my speech, that he is happy with this war – with his war. But we will not let this Entity prevail over us, even though it is the largest state in the world. Ukraine showed strength on the battlefield, using its right to self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. And no one will reproach us now or in the future with weakness or inability to fight for ourselves, for our independence. We are achieving a result in this fight and we see what the end of this war will be, and what will be the guarantees of a stable peace. The UN Charter proclaims the equality of nations – and we proved that Ukraine is equal among the equals. The UN Charter protects the inviolability of borders – and we confirm our state borderline by expelling the occupiers outside. The UN Charter stipulates the value of human rights, dignity and life, and we also stipulate them – with every Ukrainian city freed from Russian occupation. We did not provoke this war. We held 88 rounds of talks in various formats to prevent this war, just from the beginning of my presidency until February 24 this year. But Russia – instead of stopping the crime of aggression, which it started back in 2014 – turned it into a full-scale invasion. And we have no choice but to defend ourselves. We do it. We push the aggressor beyond the internationally recognized border of the Ukrainian state. And this is the first item of our peace formula. Comprehensive item. Punishment.  Punishment for the crime of aggression. Punishment for violation of borders and territorial integrity. Punishment that must be in place until the internationally recognized border is restored. Until the aggression stops. And until the damages and losses for the war are fully compensated. Therefore, sanctions against the aggressor are part of the peace formula. Blocking the trade and relations with the aggressor is part of the peace formula. All this is a punishment. So long as the aggressor is a party to decision-making in the international organizations, he must be isolated from them – at least until aggression lasts. Reject the right to vote. Deprive delegation rights. Remove the right of veto – if it is a Member of the UN Security Council. In order to punish the aggressor within the institutions. We should not turn a blind eye to propagandists who justify aggression, but apply a full package of personal restrictions against them. That is a punishment for lying. Citizens of the aggressor state should not be allowed to enjoy tourism or shopping in the territory of those who value peace, but should be encouraged through visa restrictions to fight against the aggression of their own state. Punish for abetting the evil. A Special Tribunal should be created to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against our state. This will become signal to all “would-be” aggressors, that they must value peace or be brought to responsibility by the world. We have prepared precise steps to establish such Tribunal. They will be presented to all states. Ukraine will appeal to the UN General Assembly to support an international compensation mechanism. We count on your support. Russia should pay for this war with its assets. It is also a punishment. This is one of the most terrible punishments for Russian officials, who value money above everything else. The second item of the peace formula is the protection of life. The most concrete item. Now, while the sessions of the General Assembly continue, in the Ukrainian town of Izyum, Kharkiv region, the exhumation is under way... of bodies from a mass burial, which happened when the territory was controlled by Russian troops. The bodies of women and men, children and adults, civilians and soldiers were found there. 445 graves. There is a family that died under the rubble of a house after a Russian airstrike – father, mother, 6- and 8-year-old girls, grandparents. There is a man who was strangled with a rope. There is a woman with broken ribs and wounds on her body. There is a man who was castrated before the murder, and this is not the first case. Ask, please, the representatives of Russia why the Russian military are so obsessed with castration. What was done to them so that they want to do this to others? The only thing that differs the mass burial in Izyum from what the world saw in Bucha is, in fact, the burial. The Russian army was in Izyum for a longer time, and therefore the bodies of the killed people were buried, and not scattered on the streets. So, how can we allow the Russian army somewhere on Ukrainian soil, knowing that they are committing such mass murders everywhere? We cannot. We must protect life. The world must protect life. Every state suffering the armed aggression needs the opportunity to protect its citizens and liberate its territory. If it requires help with weapons or shells – they should be provided. If you need financial help for this, it should be given. If for this, it is necessary to help with the intelligence data – just do it. But what is not needed is lies. We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms. But we need time. We tried to speed it up. We tried to implement the basic provisions of the UN Charter for Ukraine through negotiations. But Russia is afraid of real negotiations and does not want to fulfill any fair international obligations. It lies to everyone. As it is typical for aggressors, for terrorists. Even now, when Russia talks about negotiations, it only wants to slow down its retreat. Russia wants to spend the winter on the occupied territory of Ukraine and prepare forces to attempt a new offensive. New Buchas, new Izyums... Or at least it wants to prepare fortifications on occupied land and carry out military mobilization at home. We cannot agree to a delayed war. Because it will be even hotter than the war now. For us, this is a war for life. That is why we need defense support – weapons, military equipment and shells. Offensive weapons, a long-range one is enough to liberate our land, and defensive systems, above all, air defense. And we need financial support – to keep internal stability and fulfill social obligations to our people. Physical and social protection are two elements of any nation's life. So, the second item of our peace formula is the protection of life. By all available means – allowed by the UN Charter. The third item of our peace formula is restoring security and territorial integrity. Look at how many elements of global security Russia has undermined with its war – maritime safety, food safety, radiation safety, energy safety and safety from weapons of mass destruction. We are already restoring maritime safety and food security. And I thank Mr. António Guterres for his personal involvement. Algeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, Bangladesh, Israel, India, Iran, Yemen, Cyprus, China, Korea, Lebanon, Türkiye, Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Romania and France have already received Ukrainian agricultural products. And we have to increase the supply by sea. Both under market conditions and within the UN Food Program, for which Ukraine is always a reliable partner. By the way, despite all the difficulties caused by the war, we decided to provide humanitarian aid to Ethiopia and Somalia, so we will send them an additional amount of our wheat. But it is more difficult with other security elements. On the eve of the General Assembly meeting, Russia fired missiles at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant. The explosion hit the station buildings – windows were broken, walls were damaged. The rockets exploded only three hundred meters from the walls of the reactors! And this is after the IAEA's clear appeal to Russia to stop any hostile activity against any nuclear facilities of Ukraine and, in particular, against the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station – the largest one in Europe, which Russia has turned into a target. And that makes all of you a target. Russian radiation blackmailing is something that should concern each and every one of you, because none of you will find a vaccine against radiation sickness. The cost of living crisis continues in dozens of countries, it roots in the destabilization of the energy market. It is necessary to remove the main factor of global price turbulence, namely: Russian energy blackmailing. It is necessary to cap the prices at which Russia exports its energy resources. It is necessary to make Russian oil and gas – just ordinary goods again. Currently, oil and gas are Russia’s energy weapons. And that is why it manipulates the markets so that electricity, gas, petrol and diesel become the privilege of few instead of being a common good available to all. Limiting prices is safeguarding the world. This is the way to restore energy and price security. But will the world go for it? Or will it be scared? Will it be scared of Russian threats? It is necessary to take only one strong step, after which everything will become clear. The time has come for this. This step will put everything in place. After the Russian missile terror. After the massacres. After Mariupol. After the burning of Ukrainian prisoners in Olenivka by the Russian military. After blocking the ports. After the strikes of Russian tanks and missiles on nuclear power plants. And after threats to use nuclear weapons, which have become the rule, not the exception, for Russian propagandists... We must finally recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. At all levels. In all countries that confess the values of peace and protection of human life. Legally. Politically. If you don't have a legal mechanism, you can make a political decision – in the parliaments. This is the foundation for restoring global security. If this strong step is taken, doubts will disappear – whether to take other important steps. And what is very sensitive – is the border, the territorial integrity. When one country tries to steal the territory of another state, it puts all world nations under attack. Global security cannot be restored without restoring the territorial integrity of the nation which suffered the armed aggression. So, the third item of the Ukrainian peace formula is the restoration of security and territorial integrity. The fourth item is security guarantees. Every nation has the right to security guarantees. Not only the largest nations. Not only the most fortunate ones. We have proposals to upgrade the security architecture for Ukraine, and for Europe and the world, which will not allow any more aggression against us. We are already presenting them to partners. Proposals for legally binding multilateral and bilateral treaties. These are the conditions for the guarantors to act, and the timeline for their actions to bring results – results on land, at sea and in the air; in diplomacy and politics, in economy and finance, in providing weapons and intelligence. Each of you, who will receive the text of our peace formula will also see the details of what we offer as security guarantees. I do not want to compare our offers with the guarantees of any alliances that exist on the planet now. I want to stress that it is always much better to guarantee the security of a nation, preventively, rather than to stop a war after it has already begun. And the fifth item of the Ukrainian peace formula is determination. Something without which the other four items will not work. This is our determination to fight. This is the determination of the partners to help us, and also themselves. And this is the determination of the world to unite around the one who fights against armed aggression and to call to order the one who threatens all. So, all five items of our formula: punishment for aggression; protection of life; restoration of security and territorial integrity; security guarantees; and determination to defend oneself. This is the formula of crime and punishment, which is already well known to Russia. And this is the formula of justice and law and order that Russia has yet to learn. As well as any other potential aggressors. What is not in our formula? Neutrality. Those who speak of neutrality, when human values and peace are under attack, mean something else. They talk about indifference – everyone for themselves. Here's what they say. They pretend to be interested in each other's problems. They take care of each other formally. They sympathize only for protocol. And that is why they pretend to protect someone, but in reality they protect only their vested interests. This is what creates the conditions for war. This is what needs to be corrected in order to create conditions for peace. All you need is determination. There was a lot of talking about reforming the UN. How did it all end? No result. If you look carefully at our peace formula, you will see that its implementation is already becoming a de-facto reform of the United Nations. Our formula is universal, and unites the North and the South of the world. It calls for the world's majority, and encourages to expand the representation of those who remained unheard. This is an imbalance when Africa, Latin America, most of Asia, Central and Eastern Europe comply with the right of veto, that they themselves never had. And this is what Ukraine is talking about. And have you ever heard such words from Russia? But it is a permanent member of the Security Council. For some reason. For what reason, not Japan or Brazil, not Türkiye or India, not Germany or Ukraine. The day will come when this will be resolved. As for the talks between Ukraine and Russia. Probably you have happened to hear different words from Russia about the talks – as if they were ready for them. But. They talk about the talks but announce military mobilization. They talk about the talks but announce pseudo referendums in the occupied territories of Ukraine. What is true then? The military mobilization in Russia is true. Sham referendums are also true. Russia wants war. It's true. But Russia will not be able to stop the course of history. Mankind and the international law are stronger than one terrorist state. Russia will be forced to end this war. The war it has started. I rule out that the settlement can happen on a different basis than the Ukrainian peace formula. The further the Russian terror reaches, the less likely it is that anyone in the world will agree to sit at one table with them. And if my words will be followed by new Russian missiles and acts of terrorism it will only prove the weakness. Russia’s weakness. Its inability to prevail over us, its inability to prevail over the world. It will only prove that 5 items of the Ukrainian peace formula must be implemented as soon as possible.  We are ready for peace. But true, honest and fair peace. That’s why the world is on our side. And finally. I want to thank one hundred and one countries that voted for my video address to take place. It was a vote not only about the format. It was the vote about principles. Only seven countries voted against: Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Eritrea, Nicaragua, Russia and Syria. Seven. Seven who are afraid of the video address. Seven who respond to principles with a red button. Only seven. One hundred and one – and seven. Friends! If this coalition is against our determination, then I congratulate you all. Because this means that peace will prevail over any aggression, and that there is no obstacle for us to implement the peace formula. I thank you for your attention! Once again, I wish you all peace! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today I want to say special words of gratitude. Gratitude to all our people who defend our state, defend independence. Ukraine held out after a full-scale attack by Russia. Ukraine managed to unite the world around the struggle for freedom. Ukraine managed to liberate a significant part of the territory the Russian troops invaded. Ukraine liberates people from Russian captivity. And Ukraine managed to change the course of the war so that every occupier, even the most inadequate one, felt that we can win and are moving towards victory. I am thankful to everyone who fights and works for this! For the sake of our victory. It is precisely to the fact of Ukrainian strength that the leadership of Russia reacts, changing tactics and trying to draw even more Russian citizens and resources into the war. Russia's decision on mobilization is a frank admission that their regular army, which has been prepared for decades to take over a foreign country, did not withstand and crumbled. And now, due to mobilization, Russia's war against Ukraine for the majority of Russian citizens is not something on TV or on the Internet, but something that has entered every Russian home. I’ve held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. The questions are clear. Frontline. Provision of our military. And new threats created by Russia. I will note right away: any decisions of the Russian leadership do not change anything for Ukraine. We should care only about our tasks. This is the liberation of our country, the protection of our people and the mobilization of global support for the implementation of our tasks. Diplomatic mobilization of the entire international community is now taking place. The circle of those who support us now is not limited to our traditional partners and those who openly supported our state after February 24. Now almost everyone supports us - this is the reaction to new Russian escalation steps. In particular, the farce with the preparation of sham referenda in the occupied territory demonstrates what happened in 2014 in Crimea and Donbas. And I am grateful to everyone in the world who supported us. Who clearly condemned another Russian lie. Grateful to President Biden and all American friends. To President Macron, Chancellor Scholz, the President of Finland and all our Polish brothers, the Baltic states, Mr. Borrell, Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel, the OSCE and all Europeans from Iceland to Romania, who will never be deceived by Russia again. I am thankful to Britain for the support! Türkiye! Thank you Canada! Thanks also to all those who now privately express their support for Ukraine. When Russia declares that it supposedly wants negotiations, but announces mobilization... When Russia knows Ukraine's clear position about the impossibility of a diplomatic process after Russia holds any sham referenda... Everything is clear to everyone. Russia itself buries the prospect of negotiations with its own hands. I will explain to the Russians what is happening in Russian. Protests against mobilization took place in the cities of Russia - albeit not massive, but they took place. And they take place. And this is an indicator. Not only in Moscow and St. Petersburg. We know the real mood in the regions of Russia. We see that people in Dagestan, in Buryatia, in other national republics and regions of Russia understand that they were simply thrown. Thrown to death. Why, for example, Dagestanis or anyone else should die in the Kharkiv region or near Donetsk? Because one person in Russia decided so - for all the citizens of Russia. There is no other reason. That’s what he wants. You are already accomplices in all these crimes, murders and torture of Ukrainians. Because you were silent. Because you are silent. And now it's time for you to choose. For men in Russia, this is a choice to die or live, to become a cripple or to preserve health. For women in Russia, the choice is to lose their husbands, sons, grandchildren forever, or still try to protect them from death, from war, from one person. Just think about the number of people they want to take away! We know for sure that the conscription letters for 300,000 people were printed and signed in advance, even before this decision on mobilization appeared. Our intelligence has proven it. But the Russian leadership is preparing to take up to a million men into the army - this is the key thing they are now silent about. We know that they will take everyone indiscriminately. Not only the military in the reserve, but any men. Anyone who will be so intimidated that he will be more afraid of avoiding war than of dying in war. 55 thousand Russian soldiers died in this war in six months. Tens of thousands are wounded and maimed. Want more? No? Then protest. Fight back. Run away. Or surrender to Ukrainian captivity. These are options for you to survive. Russian mothers! Have no doubt that the children of the top officials of your state will not be sent to the war against Ukraine. Those who make decisions in your country take care of their children. And they do not even bury your children. And we return ours. A very important briefing was held today. Head of the Office Yermak, Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Budanov, Head of the Security Service Maliuk, Minister of Internal Affairs Monastyrskyi. They told the details of our operation to release 215 warriors, the details of the exchange. We do everything so that society and the world can see how Ukraine protects people and basic human values. Once again, I congratulate 215 families and our entire country on the return of the heroes. I am thankful to everyone who helps Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to our indomitable and brave people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Friends! Thank you for the invitation to participate in this summit. I am sure that today many wise words will be said about charity – about the experience of philanthropy and opportunities to help. Therefore, I do not want to waste your time now on what others may say. I want to draw your attention to one detail, which I think is very important – to the experience that Ukraine has acquired and that others can acquire - together with us, together with Ukraine. Ukraine is currently the only place on earth that very organically combines investment and philanthropy. In Ukraine, you can be an investor and, as a result, a de facto philanthropist in relation to others, you can even be just a businessman, and such quite ordinary economic activity is transformed into a real good help for hundreds of millions or even billions of people. Just look at how much the world depends on the supply of agricultural products from Ukraine to the global market. For subjects of the agricultural sector in Ukraine, for businessmen and farmers, this is business and this is work, this is the economy. But as a result, it is the right to food for hundreds of millions of people in the countries of Africa, Asia and Europe. We are currently sending agricultural products to Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen, Lebanon and other countries. This is a real lifesaver. But how much depends on logistics! When Russia blocked our seaports, exports decreased significantly. Because grain, sunflower and other agricultural raw materials are such a cargo, the supply logistics of which is very, very difficult to rebuild. Large volumes can now be delivered primarily by sea. We need more investment in the expansion of export technologies. For example, we are preparing the construction of a pipeline with Poland for the export of sunflower oil. This is a pilot. A specific project, which is the economy for us, and for the global food market, it is an element of stability, an element of security. By investing in agro-processing in Ukraine and in the construction of food storage facilities, it is possible to expand not only the logistical possibilities for the supply of agricultural products, but also the range of goods that can be supplied. The more added value Ukraine produces, the more added security the people of the world get. Look at what the production of electricity in Ukraine means. On the one hand, it is business. Quite a profitable business - in particular, in the field of green energy production. But given our ability to export electricity, this is not just business – this is a real tool to prevent energy poverty for tens of millions of people in the countries of Europe with which we border. This is the stabilization of the energy situation on the entire European continent. We are approached by Moldova, Romania, Poland, and other neighbors to help them with electricity in the winter. And we are ready to help. And that is why investments in the expansion of our energy capacities are a salvation from the cold for various peoples. Moreover! Ukraine's ability to export tens of gigawatts of electricity is an important factor in European climate policy. Currently, Europe, unfortunately, is still heavily dependent on Russia's dirty energy resources. They are dirty not only because their sale is Russia's way of financing the war. Not only because their burning pollutes the atmosphere. But also because they are extracted so brutally and carelessly in relation to the environment that their extraction in Russia is synonymous with ecological disaster. Ukrainian electricity can help replace dirty Russian energy resources. And therefore, this is climate security. We also have tremendous opportunities in the development of hydrogen energy and transportation of green hydrogen to Europe. The sun, wind, nuclear energy, green hydrogen - all this is in Ukraine, and it's not just billions of dollars that can be invested and earned, but billions of dollars that will work to help different countries and peoples - tens of millions of people. New green clean energy requires lithium, graphite and other rare earth metals. We have enough of them. Therefore, by investing in Ukraine, one can accelerate the development of green energy in other countries as well. We generate tens of millions of cubic meters of wood annually. At the same time, we ensure the restoration of forests. Investing in the production of ecological products from wood and cellulose in Ukraine is a way to reduce the world's use of petroleum products and plastic, and it is part of the joint protection of our nature. Another example is that the whole world needs fertilizers for food production. Why make or buy them from Russian gas? It is possible to build facilities for the production of tens of millions of tons of pure green and cheap ammonia in Ukraine. You can make money from this and help not only food security, but also peace - peace on our planet. Ukraine has never waged illegal wars. We are not aggressors. We have never wished harm to other peoples. We have never made geopolitics a means of conquering someone else. Why is this important? When any economic player works with us, it means that the economic potential that he creates with his business helps realize only peace, only peaceful goals. For example, if any company now works in Russia, it indirectly helps evil - at least it pays taxes to the budget of the aggressor state, that is, it supports their economy, which serves terror. Or even supplies something to the Russian army, directly helping the killers. When any state gets carried away with geopolitics and becomes an aggressor, business can inevitably become an accomplice to this evil. Therefore, we are grateful to all companies and businessmen who left the Russian market. And that is why we offer all the companies and businesses of the world to come to us in Ukraine - to start a business here, to localize their production here, to work with Ukraine in order to have access to the huge markets of the European Union, Britain, Canada and other nations with which we are friends. We give priority to the development of our processing industry - its various directions. We have a special program for its development. And we offer all investors of the world to join in its implementation. This is the same process – when investments, when business, when the economy – simply by working – become philanthropy, because they can increase the potential of peace in the world and reduce the potential of aggressors. Look at the capabilities of our IT sector and industries such as drone production. Russia tried to destroy our digital resilience. But we did not allow that. Ukrainian digital potential has endured, it is very solid. Our digitization has a powerful social aspect – it is technology that really works for the welfare and protection of people. Our people have digital documents, access to digitized government services, and a high level of digitization of business. IT companies in Ukraine are profitable, and their business is both a boon for millions and an element of peace protection, if we take the context of cyber security and Russian cyber attacks. Just like, for example, the production of drones in Ukraine. For those who invest, this is the economy. And for those who then use drones - depending on their class - it's safety, it's comfort or work. Again: I don't want to take up a lot of your time and I don't want to repeat what you've probably already heard and know. But I want to emphasize this point - any significant human effort leads to a long chain of consequences. Any significant effort of a business or a businessman leads to such consequences that directly or indirectly can affect the lives of other people - can do good. And this is achieved not even simply by giving money somewhere. But also by the fact that you work morally, work consciously, conduct your business in such a way that your investments, which give you profit, simultaneously help others have a better life – safer, more satiated, more educated, healthier, wealthier. Business has this power. And I urge all of you to boldly use this power of business – to invest in such a way that it is at the same time an aid to the normal life of various peoples. I invite you all to Ukraine! Thank you for your interest and faith in Ukraine, which you definitely have, otherwise I would not have this address of mine now. I sincerely believe that we will be able to restore justice for our country and restore peace as soon as possible. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Friends! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Olena! Even if I am not with you now, I know that our unity does not stop for a minute. This unity is our most powerful force that help us make anything possible. And the most important that we made possible to provide reliable protection of freedom. You know… Every short question “What is freedom?” does not have a universal short answer. It is one of those questions, which will bring up many new answers as long as humankind lives. But there is one element which makes incomplete any answer to the question about freedom. This element is respect for a person. For a person of any age, property status, religion, race, gender. Respect is what free society is based on. Respect is the source of democracy. Respect is what every wise father, every wise mother teach their children. Respect is clearly displayed in the life of any country. Respect is education. It is medicine. It is help for those, who find themselves in a difficult life situation, and for those, who cannot support themselves and their children. Respect is institutions that provide justice. It is cultural institutions that keep the heritage of every community, every nation and whole humanity. When all this works, when there is respect, then any person can really enjoy freedom. So it's no surprise, when the enemy of freedom destroys infrastructure of respect – everything that provides humanitarian welfare. Twenty five hundred educational facilities in Ukraine were destroyed by Russian strikes – schools, universities, educational clubs and others. More than thousand medical facilities were destroyed by Russian missiles and shelling. Tens of thousands of houses were simply burned down. Millions of people became displaced persons. Russia has caused a humanitarian disaster in Ukraine because it hates freedom. And that is why the world supported our call for unity. The world sees what Russia attacks and what Ukraine defends. We protect freedom, we protect people and do everything, so that as many friends of freedom around the world as possible can contribute to this struggle. That is why the First Lady of Ukraine set up this foundation – Olena Zelenska Foundation. She chose the humanitarian dimension, and there are huge challenges in this dimension. To restore what has been destroyed, to help those who need protection, to give hope for the future, and to give people the feeling that they are respected. This is an extremely noble cause, and I encourage all of you to join in – people, companies, foundations. Ukraine knows how to be grateful! Thank you everyone who supports us! Thank you everyone who supports Olena Zelenska Foundation! Thank you, friends of freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today, the events in New York in the framework of our state's participation in the session of the UN General Assembly are coming to an end. It was a productive week for Ukraine. Many different activities – with my participation, with the participation of the First Lady of Ukraine, with the participation of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Ukraine has shown that not only the truth, but also strength, initiative and confidence in victory are on our side. The world is always sensitive to such things. Who is really strong, and who pretends to be strong. Who really feels his strength, and who tries his best to conceal weakness and insecurity. At the General Assembly, Ukraine proposed a formula of peace, its way to the stabilization of international relations. And it was definitely heard by the world. The reaction to my speech at the General Assembly was really positive. Different countries equally wanted to hear specifics. Specifics on how to restore peace, how to end this war. Ukraine presented its vision. Clear, logical, fair and realistic. Five points. The first: punishment for the aggressor. The second: protection of life, that is, all the necessary assistance to our state in defense. The third point: restoration of security and territorial integrity. The fourth point: security guarantees. And the fifth: the determination to achieve all this together with us – the determination of the world majority. And what did Russia present? Once again, lame excuses, complaints and constant lying propaganda, which the world has got tired of long ago, but Russian representatives still repeat it. A striking contrast with us. I am grateful to all the heads of state, all the politicians, public figures, cultural and business leaders who expressed their support for us at the General Assembly and at all the events in America this week. In particular, I participated in a special meeting on food security. This is one of the key topics in the UN this year – it was Russian aggression that made it so urgent. The world is looking for means to protect people from hunger and price crisis, and Ukraine has something to offer. We constantly increase food exports, we help the UN Food Program, we send grain as humanitarian aid to the countries that need it – Ethiopia, Somalia. And Ukraine has never ever provoked any crisis in the food market. The world appreciates all this. Due to the decency of Ukraine and the constructive desire of our state to help others, we have a unique result: Russian propaganda is losing its influence even in the world where we still have to secure a strong information position, in particular in the countries of the Global South. These are Latin America, Africa, South Asia. Also this week I participated in several important formats of communication with investors. The summit under the auspices of Forbes – a meeting of the world's largest businessmen engaged in philanthropy. Video conference with representatives of BlackRock and Goldman Sachs – important global players. Clinton Global Initiative. Each such event adds attention to Ukraine, adds specific projects and benefits to our state, strengthens our resilience, and brings our victory closer. The First Lady of Ukraine met in New York with Liz Truss, the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and it was a very substantive meeting. With First Lady of France Brigitte Macron. Together with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, she met with António Guterres, the UN Secretary-General. In total, she held almost 20 meetings. At the invitation of Charles Michel, Olena took part in the Women in Conflict forum, which took place within the General Assembly. She presented a special charity fund - the Olena Zelenska Foundation, in order to accumulate even more support for Ukrainians, specifically for the humanitarian direction - primarily education, medicine and the restoration of what was destroyed by Russian strikes. We are creating all the necessary institutional framework so that anyone in the world can help us as efficiently, quickly and reliably as possible. The Prime Minister of Ukraine held dozens of high-level meetings. Accents are clear. The situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The expansion of defense, financial and sanction support. Support in preparing our country for winter, support in reconstruction. During each meeting, there was an emphasis that Russian terror must receive a clear global response - military, economic and legal, including the recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. Our proposals for security guarantees for Ukraine, for Europe and the world - a project developed by the Yermak-Rasmussen group - were outlined in New York. Denys Shmyhal also met with the heads of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other major financial and investment organizations of the world. I am grateful to all of them for their support! It is important to note the negotiations with the Prime Minister of Japan, the country that will soon chair the G7 and the UN Security Council. We discussed our priorities. Negotiations took place with the Prime Minister of Iraq - this is a new partner for Ukraine, an important partner. The Minister of Foreign Affairs held more than 30 meetings, and the vast majority of them were with representatives of countries that are not our traditional partners. We are strengthening our position in relations with Africa, Asia and Latin America. Probably, this is the most meaningful and positive participation of Ukraine in the UN General Assembly in all years of our independence. The world not only talks about Ukraine, but also realizes that by helping Ukraine, it also helps solve urgent global problems and crises. We offer a way to make the world more stable and safer. The world heard it. A very important event took place today in Izyum, Kharkiv region. Representatives of almost twenty diplomatic missions - the Baltic states and Eastern Europe, Germany, France, Spain, Slovenia, Croatia, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Türkiye, the EU Ambassador - saw with their own eyes what the Russian occupiers left behind. Ruined houses, torture chambers, mass burial site... The world will know full information about every crime committed by Russia in the temporarily occupied territories. The world will react absolutely justly to the sham referenda - they will be unequivocally condemned, and to the criminal mobilization that the occupiers are currently trying to carry out in Crimea and other parts of Ukraine, which they so far control. These are not just crimes against international law and the law of Ukraine. These are crimes against specific people, against the nation. Now in Crimea, in places of dense residence of qırımlılar, there are attempts to find and mobilize as many men as possible. We already have evidence of this. This is a deliberate attempt by Russia to destroy the Crimean Tatar people, this is a deliberate attempt by the aggressor state to take the lives of as many residents of the territory the Russian troops invaded as possible. I have a simple request to all our people in the temporarily occupied territory: do the main thing – save your lives and help us weaken and destroy the occupiers. Hide from the Russian mobilization by any means. Avoid conscription letters. Try to get to the free territory of Ukraine. But if you get into the Russian army, sabotage any activity of the enemy, hinder any Russian operations, provide us with any important information about the occupiers – their bases, headquarters, warehouses with ammunition. And at the first opportunity, switch to our positions. Do everything to save your life and help liberate Ukraine. Since the beginning of active actions in the east of our country in September, about 9 thousand square kilometers of territory and about 400 settlements have already been liberated. This tangible result was achieved in particular thanks to the fact that our people in the temporarily occupied territory helped us. Please do everything to increase such help. Give our special services all the information about those who organize and help conduct this farce with sham referenda. Provide all information about the Russian mobilization, about the Russian army in general. Help those in the occupied areas who need it: elderly people, single people, families with children. Ukraine will return to all its lands, and we must save as many of our people there as possible. Pursuant to my instruction, Head of the Office Andriy Yermak held a meeting today regarding assistance to Ukrainians whom we have freed from captivity. The Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, the Head of the National Guard, the ministers of internal affairs, defense, healthcare, social policy, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our ombudsman were present. Our warriors must receive everything the necessary, real help, any assistance. The state knows how to be grateful to its heroes. I am waiting for a report at the beginning of the week with a specific plan on supporting each person. Today, the Russian army used Iranian drones for attacking the Dnipropetrovsk region and Odesa. I commissioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide a tough response to this fact. The world will know about every fact of collaboration with evil, and it will have corresponding consequences. It has already been decided to deprive the Ambassador of Iran to Ukraine of accreditation, as well as to significantly reduce the number of diplomatic personnel of the Iranian Embassy. Six of these Iranian drones were shot down by our anti-aircraft troops of the \"East\" and \"South\" air commands. Another one was shot down by the anti-aircraft defense of the Naval Forces. In addition, the “Center” air command shot down a Russian strike aircraft and a helicopter today in the south of our country. And I was just informed about another Iranian combat drone shot down by the anti-aircraft troops of the \"South\" command. I am grateful to our warriors for accuracy! I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for the victory of Ukraine! I am grateful to everyone in the world who helps us protect life and freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today, I signed the decree awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to Serhiy Sova. A fighter of the glorious 93rd mechanized brigade \"Kholodnyi Yar\". He has defended our state - Ukraine since the beginning of the war in 2014, fought for Pisky, for the Donetsk airport. After February 24, he fought in the Kharkiv region. Serhiy Sova gave his life for Ukraine. We've all seen the photo of his hand with blue and yellow bracelets on his wrist. He has worn them as a talisman since 2014. And this photo was one of the first from Izyum, from the mass burial site in the forest that was discovered when the occupiers fled. He was a true warrior and a father that one can be proud of. Eternal memory and honor to the hero! Eternal glory to all our warriors who gave their lives in battles for our state! Today I awarded the honorary award \"For Courage and Bravery\" to three of our brigades. The 1st separate tank Siversk brigade, the 40th separate artillery brigade, the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia, the fighters of the 1st separate tank brigade have performed their tasks with dignity and courage. First in the Chernihiv region, and now in the hottest spots of the south and east of our country. In six months, more than a thousand warriors of this brigade were awarded state awards. Units of the 40th separate artillery brigade defend the state in the Kharkiv direction and do it very bravely and effectively. The proven losses of the Russian army from the fire of this brigade of ours make it clear to all the occupiers that there will be no place for the enemy on our land. This month, the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade achieved good results in the south of our country, liberating a number of settlements in the Kherson region. During the period of the full-scale invasion of Russia, three warriors in the 57th brigade were already awarded the \"Gold Star\" Order and 275 servicemen received state awards. By the way, since the establishment of such an award for our military units - and it was established in May of this year - 46 military units have already been awarded for courage and bravery. Of them, 38 military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, four military units of the State Border Service, four military units of the National Guard. I am grateful to all of you, guys! Well done! The heroism and grit of our warriors, the striving for independence and justice, which united all our people, do not leave a single doubt that Ukraine will prevail and that all invaders on our territory will definitely be defeated. Unless they run away. Indeed, it is true. Once again I want to say to Russians in Russian. It was no coincidence that the criminal mobilization declared by Russia was immediately called a “mobilization to graves” by the citizens of Russia themselves. Mobilization to graves. The Russian authorities are well aware that they are sending their citizens to death - there are no other options. Russian commanders do not care about the lives of Russians - they just need to replenish the empty spaces left by the dead, wounded, those who fled or the Russian soldiers that were captured. Your government does not care who will take these places. Either young IT specialists who did not serve at all, or pensioners who served only in the Soviet army. So, the key moment has come for you: right now it is being decided whether your life will end or not. It is better not to take a conscription letter than to die in a foreign land as a war criminal. It is better to run away from criminal mobilization than to be crippled and then bear responsibility in the court for participating in the war of aggression. It is better to surrender to Ukrainian captivity than to be killed by the strikes of our weapons, absolutely fair strikes, as Ukraine defends itself in this war. We defend the brightest - we defend our lives, our children, our freedom. What is Russia fighting for? Every citizen of Russia knows - even if many do not admit it, they know for sure - that it is Russia that brings evil. Ukraine guarantees every Russian soldier who surrenders three things. First, you will be treated in a civilized manner, in accordance with all conventions. Second, no one will know the circumstances of your surrender, no one in Russia will know that your surrender was voluntary. And third, if you are afraid to return to Russia and do not want an exchange, we will find a way to ensure this as well. Ukraine will do everything for its victory. And every citizen of Russia should understand: no tricks will help the occupier. I promise you that. We will retaliate against every strike of the aggressor - at Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Nikopol, Donbas, at all our cities and regions... We will definitely liberate our entire country - from Kherson to the Luhansk region, from Crimea, I emphasize that, to the Donetsk region. We will not allow the occupier to go unpunished. Every murderer and torturer will be brought to justice for what he did against us, Ukrainians. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to our indomitable people! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for our homeland - for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today we have great news. Maryana Mamonova, a combat medic, defender of Azovstal whom we freed from Russian captivity gave birth to a daughter. I sincerely congratulate Maryana from the bottom of my heart and wish the girls only the best - peace and victory. This is another proof that life always triumphs over any evil. And evil under the Russian flag is no exception to this rule. Now all our state structures, which are needed, are fully working to help our released warriors. Medical aid, social, legal... Treatment, rehabilitation, restoration of documents, bank cards, housing, etc. Rustem Umerov, pursuant to my instruction, visited our commanders from \"Azovstal\" in Turkey today. He checked their living conditions - the conditions are comfortable. The boys are provided with everything they need. Rustem controls that. Soon we will ensure that the boys meet their relatives and friends. This week, on Tuesday, I am to receive a clear plan for each of those released - how their normal lives will be restored. Just as the process of releasing our heroes from captivity, this process of normalization is managed by Andriy Yermak, Head of the Office. He is also assisted by Kyrylo Budanov, Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as well as our ombudsman, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Security Service, etc. I would like to emphasize: work is ongoing regarding the next exchanges. No matter how difficult it may be, we must free all our people, all Ukrainians. We do not forget about anyone. But we should still remember: it is not easy, it requires the efforts of many people, and it is directly related to the situation on the frontline. Our active actions include, in particular, the increase of those whom we can exchange. The more Russian soldiers are detained by Ukrainian forces, the faster we will be able to free our warriors, our heroes from Russian captivity. Fierce fighting takes place in many sections of the front with a total length of more than 2,000 kilometers. This is the Donetsk region, this is our Kharkiv region, Kherson region, as well as Mykolaiv and Zaporizhia regions. We have positive results in several directions. And no matter what happens this week in Russia, no matter what steps the terrorist state plans - political or military - the tasks of our state, the tasks of Ukraine, cannot change: we are fighting for life and freedom for all Ukrainians. This week there will be a new wave of our diplomatic activity. My new appeals to the political, business and student communities abroad. Our needs, our positions, our view on how to stop Russian evil will be heard everywhere in the world, absolutely everywhere. We will also make a special emphasis. Emphasis on the fact that criminal mobilization is used by Russia not only to prolong the suffering of people in Ukraine and to further destabilize the world, but also to physically exterminate men - representatives of indigenous peoples who live in the territories controlled so far, temporarily, by the Russian Federation. The situation in the occupied Crimea is catastrophic. The information about the Crimean Tatar people is fully confirmed: most of the mobilization letters are given there specifically to qırımlılar. This is another element of Russia's policy of genocide, another reason for the immediate and tough reaction of the whole world. The same is happening on the territory of Russia itself. This is a deliberate imperial policy. This is a blow to the peoples of, for example, Dagestan and the entire Caucasus, to the indigenous peoples of Siberia and other territories. And I want to repeat it once again. Again in Russian, specially for Russian \"comrades\". And this is not a kind of collection of peoples in Russia, not badges or flags somewhere on the map, no. These are not candy wrappers - these are real people. And only now you are beginning to hear it, yet still not everywhere. We see that people, in particular, in Dagestan, began to fight for their lives. We see that they are beginning to understand that this is a question of their lives. Why should their husbands, brothers, sons die in this war? In a war that one man wants. In a war against our people, on our land. He does not send his children to war. Fight to ensure that your children are not sent to die - everyone who can be taken by this criminal Russian mobilization. Because if you come to take the lives of our children - I will tell you as a father - we will not let you go alive. I want to emphasize once again: there is a way out. Do not submit to criminal mobilization. Flee. Or surrender to Ukrainian captivity at the first opportunity. I urge all our friends in the information field to spread this appeal. The more citizens of the Russian Federation at least try to protect their own lives, the sooner this criminal war of Russia against the people of Ukraine will end. I am thankful to everyone who fights and works for our victory! A difficult week is ahead. A difficult path. Difficult challenges. But ahead is our victory. And it is inevitable. This evening, I want to congratulate the Ukrainian Jewish community and all the Jews of the world on Rosh Hashanah. May all prayers for victory, all prayers for peace for Ukraine be heard. Keep defending Ukraine! Keep defending life! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I held another meeting of the Staff today. The main focus is on the operational situation on the frontline. We heard the report by the Commander-in-Chief, commanders, head of intelligence, Minister of Defense. We discussed the use of new weapons by the occupiers, in particular, Iranian drones. We are constantly working to provide our warriors with weapons and ammunition. All active actions of the Ukrainian military must be synchronized with the use of high-precision weapons. This is one of the basic priorities. The situation is particularly tough in the Donetsk region. We are doing everything to curb enemy activity. This is where our number one goal is right now, as Donbas is still the number one goal for the occupiers. Despite the obvious senselessness of the war for Russia and the occupiers' loss of initiative, the command of the Russian military still drives them to their death. Constant attempts of the Russian offensive in the Donetsk region will surely go down in the history of wars as one of the most cynical murders of one’s own soldiers. When we see this, when we see these offensives, we are once again convinced that the Russian mobilization is a frank attempt to give commanders on the ground a constant stream of \"cannon fodder.\" There is simply no other point in the Russian mobilization. They felt that they will lose, and they are simply trying to delay this moment, to ensure at least some activity at the front, to replace the dead with at least someone with weapons in their hands. Unfortunately, Russian society is not yet aware of all the brutality of the Russian government towards its own people. But we must do everything so that every citizen of Russia recognizes that his own state is depriving him of the most important thing - the right to life. I spoke today with Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. In particular about the criminal mobilization that Russia is carrying out in the occupied territory, trying to throw our citizens to death under the Russian flag. We also talked about sham referenda - the world's reaction to them and to any further steps taken by the occupiers will be tough. I am thankful to the Prime Minister for his clear support and willingness to increase sanction pressure on Russia. We coordinated our steps in international organizations, discussed defense cooperation. I held a meeting with the head of our Government, Denys Shmyhal. We summarized the results of our international activity in September, the results of contacts with partners. No matter how difficult it is, the state fulfills all its social obligations. We are carrying out work as part of Fast Recovery, returning normal life to the territory liberated from the occupiers. We are taking the necessary steps in preparation for the winter period. I took part in the launch of a special investment fund to support our Ukrainian entrepreneurs and export-oriented companies. The fund has already attracted 125 million dollars, and the amount will be doubled. The most esteemed Western funds, banks and institutions have invested in this fund, Horizon Capital Growth - that's what it's called. I am grateful to everyone who prepared and implemented this investment project. And I believe that it can become a special signal for investors - a signal that it is possible and necessary to invest in the Ukrainian economy already now, as we are on the path to our victory. An important political and diplomatic event took place in the Office today. A project on the establishment of a Special International Tribunal to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against our state was presented to the ambassadors of thirty states - our partners. The difficulty of prosecuting Russia for this crime is that the existing international legal instruments are not enough. What is needed is a Special International Tribunal. And we are working on this project in great detail and meticulously. I have no doubt - the Tribunal will take place. Everyone who unleashed this criminal war against Ukraine and freedom in Europe will be brought to account. I thank everyone who defends our country! Today I especially want to celebrate the warriors who are defending Ukraine now in the Donetsk region. Warriors of the 93rd separate mechanized brigade \"Kholodnyi Yar\" and the 10th separate mountain assault brigade - for heroic defense in the Bakhmut direction. And I also want to praise the warriors of the 80th airborne assault brigade for their decisive and competent actions during the liberation of our territory. Thank you guys! A total of 2135 warriors of these three brigades have already been awarded state awards. Eternal glory to all those who gain victory for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear members of the UN Security Council who respect and adhere to the UN Charter! Dear representatives of states and leaders who are listening to me now! The UN Security Council is an institution that functions according to well-known and defined rules - according to the regulations, which are still observed even by the representatives of Russia. So far they do not use weapons instead of words in this hall and do not knock their neighbors' seats out. But surely no one will be surprised if this hall of the UN Security Council is also turned into a zone of violence by representatives of Russia. Russia already despises the UN Charter. Russia already breaks any rules of this world. So it's only a matter of time before it destroys this last international institution that can still act. It can! I urge you to act now. Anyone in the world can now name hundreds of examples of how Russia violates the international legal order and destroys the body of international law. It constantly provokes escalation and constantly responds to any proposals for talks with new brutality on the battlefield, even greater crises and threats to Ukraine and the world. And these are obvious things. I will name only five, just what is happening right now. First, Russia ignored the IAEA's call for the immediate de-occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the cessation of any hostilities against any nuclear facilities of Ukraine. This fact once again proves that Russia is deliberately keeping the world on the verge of a radiation disaster. The second is nuclear blackmail. Threats to use nuclear weapons have become a constant narrative of Russian officials and propagandists. This proves that Russia has no right to possess nuclear weapons, as it is not capable, simply not capable of guaranteeing the safety of the world even against the threat of using nuclear weapons. Third, last week I presented the Ukrainian peace formula at the UN General Assembly. Russia's response to this real path to peace was the announcement of mobilization. Moreover, Russia deliberately focuses its mobilization on the indigenous peoples of the territories it controls. And these are not only the territories of the Caucasus or Siberia, where everything is being done to mobilize as many men as possible from indigenous peoples. This is also Crimea, Ukrainian Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014. Among all the ethnic groups of Crimea, it was the men of the indigenous people - the Crimean Tatars - who received the most Russian mobilization letters in proportion to the total number. This is an outright policy of genocide! Fourth, before the eyes of the whole world, Russia is conducting an outright farce called a \"referendum\" on the occupied territory of Ukraine. Under the guns people are forced to fill out some papers - for a TV picture. The figures of the alleged results of the sham referendum were drawn in advance. Just as the compulsory issuance of passports to the population of the occupied territories was held in advance. And what is it for? The answer is in the next point. The fifth is the annexation of seized territories. The most brutal violation of the UN Charter. This is an attempt to steal the territory of another state. This is an attempt to erase the norms of international law. And this is a very cynical attempt to forcibly mobilize men in the occupied territory of Ukraine into the Russian army in order to send them to fight against their own homeland! There is only one way to stop all this. First – complete isolation of Russia in response to everything it does. A state that is implementing a policy of genocide right now, keeping the world one step away from a radiation disaster, and at the same time threatening nuclear strikes cannot remain a permanent member of the UN Security Council with veto power. Russia must be excluded from all international organizations. If such exclusion is complicated by the procedure, its participation must be suspended. Second – new and tough global sanctions against Russia are needed. Any annexation in the modern world is simultaneously a crime against all states that consider the inviolability of borders vital for themselves. Third – any Russian criminal actions do not change anything for us. We do not give in to the blackmail of terrorists. It is in Ukraine and in this war that not only our independence is being defended, not only the right to life for our people, but also international law as such. Ukraine must receive all the necessary defense and financial aid so that the aggressor loses. Fourth – Ukraine must receive clear and legally binding guarantees of collective security. Since it is the independence of our country that is of such fundamental importance for many elements of global security, the world needs a corresponding security architecture. And fifth – very important. I want everyone to understand this. Russia's recognition of these sham referenda as allegedly normal, implementation of the so-called “Crimean scenario” and another attempt to annex the territory of Ukraine will mean that there is nothing to talk about with this President of Russia. Annexation is the kind of move that pits him alone against the whole of humanity. Such a clear signal is now needed from every country in the world. I believe in your ability to act! I am very grateful to the French Presidency for the opportunity to participate in this meeting. Thank you all for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! I have just taken part in a meeting of the UN Security Council. This is a special meeting convened at our initiative. I am grateful to all partners who supported the convening of this meeting and clearly spoke in defense of Ukraine and international law. Fundamental norms of international law! The crime of aggression against our state, the farce in the occupied territory, which the occupiers call referenda, the preparation of another attempt to annex Ukrainian territory - all these are steps Russia is taking to finish off the UN Charter. I called on the members of the Security Council to stop the one who sets himself against everyone in the world. It is possible. It is possible right now, when the final destructive steps have not yet been taken. I emphasized at the Security Council meeting: Russia's implementation of the so-called Crimean scenario and another attempt to annex Ukrainian territory will mean that there is nothing to talk about with this President of Russia. This is clear and obvious. None of Russia’s criminal actions will change anything for Ukraine. We recognize the UN Charter, we recognize the basic principles of coexistence of peoples. And we will continue to act in order to protect normal life in Ukraine, in Europe, and in the world. We will act to protect our people in the Kherson region, in the Zaporizhzhia region, in Donbas, in the currently occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, and in Crimea. This farce in the occupied territory cannot even be called an imitation of referenda. We knew in advance what would be drawn instead of the result. Even intelligence didn't have to work very hard. The agreed figures for this farce were thrown into the media. Russia is not even hiding. The only rational response to such audacity of the occupier is even more support for Ukraine. And I am thankful to our partners who confirm such support: defense, financial, sanctions. I spoke today with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. I thanked him for his firm condemnation of the Russian sham referenda. The situation on the frontline and further support for the Armed Forces of Ukraine by the Alliance members were discussed in detail. Every new Russian strike on Ukrainian cities and our civilian objects proves that the existing defense support for Ukraine is not enough. We make this clear to our partners. And they hear us. And this is important. Today in Kyiv, I held talks with the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France. France is making significant efforts to really help our country and to solve the crises created by Russia. The situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP was discussed in detail with the minister. Our defense needs were discussed in detail. We also discussed in detail our joint reaction to each further provocative step by Russia with sham referenda. Today in Moscow, yet another false statement was made regarding a very important achievement of Ukraine and our partners - the restoration of our seaborne grain export. It is obvious that Russia is preparing the ground for an attempt to disrupt the grain initiative. We inform partners about this. Export statistics is crystal clear and available to everyone in the international community. More than 5 million tons of agricultural products were exported from our three ports. 232 vessels departed. If we take only African countries, our agricultural products have already been exported to Algeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia. It is necessary to act immediately so that Russia does not again put these and other countries in the conditions of a food crisis. And I am grateful to everyone who opposes the Russian destabilization policy! I am grateful to everyone who helps protect our state! As for the frontline, I will say it briefly and for now without details, although they will be good: we are moving forward and liberating our land. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear students and lecturers! The great Harvard community! Thank you for the opportunity to address you. I have a little more than a few words as in the invitation to this speech I was offered to focus on two topics: peace and leadership. And it seems to me this is a good offer. So I'd like to talk about that first, and then I'm sure we'll have plenty of time to talk and I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. What we all strive for is peace. And what makes it possible to realize our aspirations is leadership. I'll start with a few examples. Literally today, another blackmailing statement about nuclear weapons was made in Moscow. The Russian leadership is trying its hardest to give us all the impression that they are willing to use nuclear weapons. All day long there are statements that they are willing to annex another part of the Ukrainian territory. They say that there are supposedly no obstacles to annexation. A statement on the grain export corridor was also made. A statement, which obviously prepares the conditions for Russia to once again disrupt the export of agricultural products of Ukraine and thereby again put dozens of African and Asian countries at risk of starvation. What is accompanied by all this? That’s my question. Russia either speaks openly or means that the world will simply \"swallow\" all this: nuclear blackmail, criminal annexation, and yet another mass famine, which the Kremlin knows well how to organize. Do you consider such a situation tolerable? When someone alone threatens everyone. When someone alone thinks he has the right to kill and starve. When someone alone has become so insolent that it is no longer enough for him to steal money or resources from his own territory, now he wants to steal from the territory of others as well. I think this is not normal for all of us. Even at the level of rhetoric, these are already crimes. Nuclear blackmail, annexations, starvation and anything of a kind even at the level of claims about it deserve tough actions. I think so. Actions to prevent any catastrophic scenario. But what actions do we see in response to the statements coming from Russia? This is a fundamental question about leadership. You must have a special sense of leadership here at Harvard University. Harvard is one of the world's most powerful sources of leadership. Hundreds of different leaders of politics, jurisprudence, science, business, and other spheres of human activity received education and key skills here. And in those who were really successful, you can notice one common feature. It is the ability to act first. To act in advance. To act when the majority does not yet understand that it is necessary to act. Or vice versa - when everyone already understands everything, but is so afraid of terrible consequences that they simply freeze when it is necessary to neutralize their cause before it explodes into a catastrophe. This is prevention. Prevention is a key aspect of leadership. And it is in politics that it works most obviously. We all know that seat belts should be used in the car. They save us from the consequences that may occur if an accident occurs. We don't wait for an accident to personally verify that seat belts are required. We trust the experience of those accidents that have already happened. Many of us - if not all - use insurance services. They may be different, but they are arranged in approximately the same way: in case of negative consequences, a person receives compensation according to the terms of the contract. The insurance contract enters into force before anything happens and acts as a guarantee - a guarantee of protection. For all of us, it is normal when a murderer is isolated after a conviction. We know that this is not only a retribution for the crime committed, but also a way to protect society from another murder that could happen if the murderer remains at large. No one wants to wait for the second murder to make sure that the killer is definitely a killer. He is convicted for the very first murder. And that's right. And it can be life imprisonment - in the case of a particularly dangerous act committed by a person. All these are realities. All this is the principle of prevention. It is with us in ordinary life to give us the security of this life. This is also how prevention should work when solving political issues and in international relations. Should work. This is what we’ve been saying last year, when the world watched as Russia brought its army to the border of Ukraine for a full-scale strike. We said: let's act preemptively, right now, right away, without waiting for the strike to happen. We said: let's act in relation to the preparation of the strike as if it had happened. So that the aggressor feels the painful consequences in advance - before he does the irreparable and starts a brutal war. But... But... But... You know how things turned out. When there are no preventive actions, there is only one thing left - to react. And this is always a less strong position. Because when you act preventively, you are automatically the leader of the situation, you determine its development. And when you are forced to react, you still have to fight for leadership. You must first win the initiative, and then you can work for success. Your success. And now we are at the same critical moment that was on the eve of a full-scale invasion. This is the moment for preventive actions. Russia started talking about nuclear weapons. Russian propagandists are saying even louder than before that strikes and annexations are waiting not only for our state, but also for others - from Kazakhstan to the Baltic countries, from Georgia to Moldova and Poland. The Russian President says again - and very frankly, by the way - that he wants to undermine the grain export initiative, on which the food security of tens of millions of people depends. Look at the situation with nuclear facilities in Ukraine. For the first time in history, a nuclear power plant was directly fired at from tanks. For the first time in history, cruise missiles were struck on the territory of the nuclear power plant. Why is Russia doing all this? It sees a lack of prevention in the world. Russia must feel devastating consequences already now. For the very fact of such threats, the very fact of such rhetoric. Only preventive actions can show that the world will not \"swallow\" anything and that the aggressor will have to pay a severe price for all this. To do it now, to act preemptively, is to prevent catastrophic damage. To react when the Russian strikes have already happened, is to receive damage and find yourself at a new level of escalation. These days, Russia hopes to announce a new annexation of the occupied territories of Ukraine. This has been in preparation for a long time, this has been obvious for a long time. We see these sham referenda in those territories that Russia wants to \"devour\". And we know that the mobilization in Russia was announced on the eve of this new criminal annexation not by chance. The goal is obvious - the occupier wants to take the residents of the occupied territory into the army. Either you are killed, or you kill - Russia wants to force hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in the occupied lands to make such a choice. And there is no preventive sanctions strike that would show Russia that it will not be able to \"devour\" any part of Ukraine. When there is such a lack of preventive measures, when leadership is manifested afterwards - in response, in adaptation to the negative consequences of certain actions of Russia, this leads to a loss of time, a loss of opportunities. It makes the path to peace longer. Leadership and peace are two things that are directly related. The fact is that we have become leaders in the war. We were all forced to become leaders in the war - in the fight against the evil that started this war. We have achieved an unprecedented unification of the free world. And by the way, I want to thank the United States of America and President Biden, all our American friends for their contribution to this unification. This is an invaluable contribution. Second, millions of Ukrainians demonstrate unprecedented personal leadership every day. Think of only one number - 30 thousand. Almost as many Ukrainian warriors have already been awarded state awards for bravery over these six months. But it is not only about our warriors. For Ukraine, this is a people's war. Millions of people stood up to defend freedom, to defend independence. These are children who support the military: they raise money for defense, write letters to the front and even just carry water to our men at checkpoints. These are thousands of volunteers. These are our heroic doctors and nurses. They carry out surgeries under shelling, help deliver babies in bomb shelters, help those who were crippled by Russian strikes. I can cite many examples when the personal leadership of one or another person now - from the presidents of the countries that support us to the ordinary people who expel the invaders from Ukraine - is a component of our common leadership in the war and a part of our future victory. But we must learn to be leaders in peace! We have to draw the main conclusion now. Prevention is a basic thing. This is something that can do the most to maintain peace. This is what can stop aggression faster. This is what can save more lives than any response to a disaster that has already occurred. And this is what can maintain peace for a long time, when the principle of prevention is laid as the basis of the post-war architecture of security guarantees. This is precisely our Ukrainian view of leadership, security, and peacekeeping. This is something that can and should work. This is what we call for. What we put as the basis of specific draft solutions. Leadership without prevention is not complete. Without the ability to act in advance. Without the ability to hit when you see that you are about to be hit. Even the best teamwork post hoc does not give you the opportunities you have when you know how to use the moment for preventive actions. When you know how to act first. The free world is definitely stronger than any aggressors and terrorists. The free world will definitely prevail in this confrontation with Russia. We will be able to restore peace - I have no doubt about it. But the answer to the question of when this will happen depends on the answer to the question of how often we will act first. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for supporting Ukraine! And I sincerely wish all of you to be leaders in the field that you have chosen for yourself or about to choose. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Our key task now is to coordinate actions with partners in response to sham referenda organized by Russia and all related threats. This is not 2014. Everything is clear for everyone. And there will certainly be actions. I’ve held a whole series of negotiations today. President of Türkiye Erdoğan, Chancellor of Germany Scholz, Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Truss, Secretary-General of the UN Guterres, President of the European Council Charles Michel. Thank you all for your clear and unequivocal support. Thank you all for understanding our position. Ukraine cannot and will not put up with any attempts by Russia to seize any part of our land. I once again thanked President Erdoğan today for his help in freeing our people from Russian captivity. Commanders from Azovstal, who are in Türkiye, will soon be able to see their relatives. We are working on it. Also, by the way, the implementation of the plan to help each of those recently released from captivity has already begun. They receive priority elements of assistance. First of all, it is medical support - they all need recovery after what they had to go through in captivity. This work is under the control of the Ombudsman, representatives of the Office, intelligence, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Ministry of Health, and the command of the Medical Forces. And we will extend the appropriate measures, which are being worked out in detail now, to all our people whom we free from the captivity of the occupiers. I will emphasize once again: we remember all our people and try to free each and every one of them from captivity, not a single Ukrainian has been forgotten. We discussed today with President Erdoğan our further defense cooperation, our response to all the aggressive steps that Russia has already taken and is still preparing to take. We discussed a wide range of issues with the Chancellor of Germany - political, financial, defense, energy. In the defense topic, I emphasized that we are waiting for an anti-missile defense system from Germany - I’m grateful for the willingness to help with air defense. Other points of defense cooperation were also discussed in detail - there are quite a lot of them, they are clear. Of course, energy issues were touched upon, including the supply of gas to Europe and sabotage at the Nord Stream gas pipeline. We discussed with Mr. Chancellor the preparation of the new sanctions package of the European Union - together we must make it really powerful, not symbolic. As of today, there is still something to add to the eighth sanctions package. The conversation with the Prime Minister of Canada was, as always, very specific and concerned primarily how Canada can increase support for Ukraine. Among other things, demining was discussed. Canada has both the appropriate technology and the appropriate humanitarian ambitions. I invited Prime Minister Trudeau to lead a global effort to clear our land of Russian mines and projectiles. Due to the Russian war, Ukrainian land is one of the most contaminated by mines in the world. And while there are similar examples of large-scale mine contamination around the world, we must do what others have not done: we must set a precedent for rapid and large-scale demining, not leave this problem for decades. I thank Canada for its willingness to help us. With Mrs. Liz Truss, we discussed the possibilities of Britain in enhancing sanctions on Russia, as well as in increasing defense aid for our country. I am grateful for the principled condemnation of the Russian farce under the guise of a referendum, for the full support and willingness to move with us towards the return of freedom to all our people - in all parts of Ukraine, without any exceptions. The conversation with the Secretary-General of the UN also concerned sham referenda and Russia's apparent preparation of the ground for an attempt to annex our territory. These brutal violations of the UN Charter must be punished. We discussed the implementation of our grain export initiative with Mr. Guterres. We agreed that the initiative should not only be preserved, not only protected from any attempts to disrupt it, but also expanded. Ukraine is ready to significantly increase the export of our agricultural products to the countries that need them and the corresponding interaction with the UN for humanitarian purposes and assistance to such countries as Somalia, Ethiopia, etc. I have just finished a call with Charles Michel. As always, it was a conversation between real friends. Thank you for your full support in the issue of sham referenda and for your willingness to extend aid to Ukraine. Of course, we also discussed the preparation of new sanctions. Tomorrow I will continue intensive communication with the leaders. And today I want to once again thank the United States of America and personally President Biden for the new package of defense support for our country in the amount of more than 1 billion dollars. This is really important. If someone in Russia thinks they can \"get away\" with everything they are doing in the occupied territory, if someone in Russia hopes the world will abandon its own values, frightened by another Russian announcement of annexation, they in Russia are wrong. Each subsequent escalating step by the occupier only confirms the fact that the world must act even tougher. In the evening, I signed another decree awarding our defenders. State awards were awarded to: 71 warriors of the National Guard, 21 employees of the State Emergency Service, 52 border guards. 320 combatants were awarded for their brave and effective actions during the liberation of the districts of the Kharkiv region from the occupation. As for the situation at the front, everything is clear to us. Therefore, I repeat again… For those who understand only Russian. If you want to live, run. If you want to live, surrender. If you want to live, fight on your streets for your freedom. Everything was taken from you anyway. Or maybe any of you have oil rigs? Palaces? Vineyards? Maybe yachts? Or some bank? What are you fighting for? The only thing you have is loans, something to eat in the evening and now there’s mobilization. Fight for what’s yours! Stay away from our land, our soul and our culture. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mrs. President! Dear forum participants! Everyone who values the democratic system and wants to preserve it for future generations! There are many discussions about democracy in the world now. About what threatens democracy. About how democracy can be protected. And about what needs to be done so that democracy still prevails in the global confrontation. People feel that right now something is happening that could become decisive in the centuries-old confrontation between democracy and tyranny. And it is precisely in this address, precisely to the Athens Democracy Forum, that I want to say that I am sure: we will be able to guarantee the future of democracy, we will be able to protect it. We will, because we know what gives democracy strength, what serves as its heart, ensuring the supply of freedom, like blood, to every part of a democratic society - to every person. This is unity. Unity is the most important thing. Democracy is the rule of law, it is respect, it is procedures, it is the equality of the free and freedom for all. But all this works only under the condition of unity, only then is all this saturated with real freedom, all this is solid. Unity makes democracy alive. When societies are completely atomized, when there are no stable ties between peoples, when someone may not come to the aid of another in a democratic community, democracy gets weaker, lags behind, falls apart. We have seen this more than once in history. We have seen how a small but energetic and maximally united tyrannical minority or party is able to subjugate the social majority, if the majority of people are scattered and do not trust each other. We have seen how some democracies decided not to intervene when other democracies were threatened, but later everyone had to defend themselves, not just those who were threatened at the beginning. We have seen that people can become disillusioned with democracy if they feel unequal and humiliated, if people lose emotional connection with their representatives in power. The consequence of this can be fascination with someone autocratic. And then?... Often a tyrant begins to destroy his own society just to retain his personal power. This is exactly what happened in Russia over the past 30 years. So unity is the universal answer. Unity in society - for people to feel a connection with each other, for people to have something in common and for this commonality to develop, giving more freedom, more comfort, more well-being. Unity between societies, between states. All democracies should act in a united fashion, be a real community, and help each other when necessary. This is not only a matter of relations between the leaders of the states. This is not a question of who is or is not historically related to whom. This is a question of struggle for a democratic system.  When we are truly together, no one will be an insurmountable threat to us. We see this now in the war that Russia has waged against our people and against our common democratic system. The greater unity we have, the more tangible Russian defeats are. And the third element - this is very important for every democratic country - unity between those in whose hands the power is and those who entrusted this power. Democracy does not live in the government offices or even in the parliament hall. Democracy lives between people. And that is why it is so important that there are no isolated groups in societies - be it the ruling group, or any other privileged groups, or any unintegrated minorities. After the full-scale invasion of Russia into Ukraine, we managed to achieve the greatest unity of Europe and the democratic community of the whole world in decades. But the greatest does not mean the maximum. We have a lot to do to further strengthen our unity. And every such step to strengthen is a step to protect democracy. Not just somewhere, not just in some country, but in general – for all of us and for our children. For all free nations. Forever free. I thank you for your attention! Thank you, Greece, for your significant support! And it is with great honor that I accept the award of the city of Athens for the Ukrainian people, for our people, for their contribution to the protection of democratic values. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Peoples of the Caucasus! Now I am in that part of Kyiv, where Imam Shamil, the hero of Dagestan and the entire Caucasus, lived in the 1860s. As you can see, Ukraine knows how to honor your heroes. We preserve the memory of those places that combined the cultures of our peoples. This is the center of our capital. One of the hundreds of Ukrainian cities against which the Russian authorities direct missiles, bombs and troops. The Caucasus knows what this means. The Caucasus saw it. For 218 days, we have been defending ourselves against those who have more missiles and people than we do, but who are completely devoid of decency. This is a vile war on the part of Russia, a criminal one. And we do everything to protect our people and the independence of Ukraine. This is our sacred duty. Duty to our parents. Duty to our children. Duty to all generations of our people - those who lived and those who will live on our land. We don't need what’s not ours! Already 58,500 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine. They came to kill us and died. You are not told this number. You are being lied to about the alleged death toll of about six thousand. 58.5! That's the truth. All of them died because one person wanted this war. Only one, which many people serve. Peoples of the Caucasus! All peoples on the territory of Russia! You have no reason to be among these many who still serve the one who wants this war. You do not have to die in Ukraine. Your sons do not have to die in Ukraine. You have no such obligation. Not to your parents, not to your children, not to your future, not to the future of your land. And you know it. We see that you are resisting the criminal mobilization with which the Russian authorities want to cover up their failure. The failure of their regular army, their criminal orders. You are being lied to that there are allegedly no such failures. Instead of ending the senseless war for Russia, the Russian authorities are trying to send new people to replace the dead. What awaits them all? You know the answer. Ukraine will continue to defend itself and will win in this war waged against us. Because we are on our land. The truth is on our side. And the whole civilized world is with us. We are fighting for what is true for any people on the planet - for life and freedom, for the right to happiness for all our families, for all our children. Russia was left alone. It is already isolated and will be condemned for this war. \"Anyone who raises a weapon against the truth raises it to his own destruction,\" the Kremlin seems not to be aware of these words by Imam Shamil. But these words should be known in the Caucasus. They should be heard in Siberia and in all other lands from which people are being sent to this war. And now there’s mobilization. Fight to avoid death! Defend your freedom now in the streets and squares, so that later you don't have to fight in the mountains and forests simply for your right to live, when the Russian authorities start the next waves of mobilization. Did you believe that they would take only 300 thousand people? The one who started this war will not stop at the first wave of mobilization, there will be more. He will try to take other lives as well. He doesn’t care about people. He respects neither the living nor the dead… Thousands of bodies of dead Russian soldiers from various regions remain in Ukraine. They rot in the fields, they are stored in morgues. Those that were not burned by the Russian army itself. The only army in the world that carries around mobile crematoria to dispose of the bodies of its fallen soldiers when it has time to do so. But now it is fleeing so fast that it even leaves tanks and MLRS behind, not just the bodies of the dead. Just think about what it has come to! We are forced to start informational work on conveying to the citizens of Russia, who are being mobilized now, a special thesis: at least get a tattoo with your name and surname so that we know how to find your relatives when you are killed and do not even have an army token with you. The Russian authorities send people to this war without army tokens, often without documents! They do this on purpose to make it easier to lie to you about how many people actually die here. This is their special operation. Special operation on lies, terror, extermination of indigenous peoples. During the first week of criminal mobilization, more men fled from Russia than the Russian authorities were officially going to send to war. And how does the Kremlin react to this? It is sending troops to the border of Russia against the very citizens of Russia! This is a disgrace! And lies with some sham referenda, with some confessions and annexations will end in even greater disgrace for Russia. No one has to take part in a disgraceful war. Dagestanis do not have to die in Ukraine. Chechens, Ingush, Ossetians, Circassians and any other peoples who came under the Russian flag. In total, almost 200 different peoples... You know who sends them to Ukraine. The one who sends wants to make them \"cargo 200\". Do you want that? No? I'm sure you want to live. I'm sure you're tired of being lied to. I’m sure you know that it is necessary to fight now! In order for Russian citizens to go to war, they are artificially driven into poverty. Into loans. People are intimidated by repressions, harassed by propaganda. You can change it. You just need to understand who is a real symbol for you, who is a hero for you, who is the pride of your history, and who just wants to take advantage of you. Fight! And you are sure to win!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! We continue our diplomatic activity to ensure that all partners of Ukraine and the countries of the world understand what new steps towards escalation are being taken by the terrorist state these days. I spoke today with President of Poland Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi. I had a meeting with the President of the National Assembly of France. I am grateful to our partners for clearly condemning the Russian sham referenda, for condemning the attempted annexation of our territory, which the Kremlin is currently preparing. I am grateful to our Polish brothers for their invaluable defense support and our cooperation for the sake of common security. And today, in a conversation with Andrzej Duda, with Mr. President, we discussed how we can further strengthen our relations. We also discussed cross-border cooperation. We must do everything so that our nations face no obstacles for economic and any other relations. I would like to thank Prime Minister Draghi for his principled condemnation of Russia's steps towards escalation. We exchanged views on further steps in our bilateral relations with Italy and in multilateral relations at the EU level that could give all of us in Europe more protection. The first ever visit to Ukraine by the President of the National Assembly of France is taking place at a truly historic time. At a time when solidarity between leaders at all levels is critical to the future of a democratic world. I thanked Mrs. President of the National Assembly of France and her fellow parliamentarians for their willingness to continue to help us defend the independence of Ukraine and the freedom of the whole of Europe. I talked today with the university community and public figures of Switzerland on the basis of the University of Zurich. It is very important that Switzerland and its citizens do not remain neutral, and support our aspiration to live - to live freely and in peace. Everyone in the world understands well what such an attempted annexation would actually mean. It will not mean what the Kremlin hopes for. Today I explained this to the peoples of the Caucasus, Siberia, and other indigenous peoples of Russia. And now I repeat for everyone in this country: Russia will not get a new territory of Ukraine. Russia will annex itself to the catastrophe that it has brought to the occupied territory of our country. Russia will equate itself with the so-called \"DPR\" and \"LPR\", and will completely finish off those institutions of normal statehood that still remained in Russia. The occupier fills the occupied territory of Ukraine with graves, and there are more and more graves on the territory of Russia itself. The occupier sets up torture chambers in the occupied territory - and will fill the entire territory of Russia with torture chambers. This is the only way the Russian police and Russian special services will work now. The law in Russia has been obliterated. And those who brought all these deaths, torture, rape from Russia will take them home. Everywhere in the seized territory, the occupier destroys any basis for life - economy, social sphere, culture... Depriving the entire Russian society of a normal economy, a decent life and respect for any human value will be the price for the fact that one person in Russia wants this war to continue. This can still be stopped. But to stop it, you have to stop that one in Russia who wants war more than life. Your life, citizens of Russia. Today, the Russian army inflicted another vile attack on civilians in Mykolaiv - a shell exploded near a public transport stop. There are dead, there are wounded... Again shelling of Kharkiv, the Sumy region, fierce shelling in Donbas, in the south of Ukraine. All this can be stopped in only one way: liberation. And before Russia came, there was normal life everywhere on Ukrainian land. And when Russia leaves, when we oust it, normal life will return. This is the only way. This is the way to our victory. We cannot know how long it will take to complete this path. But we know that no Russian manipulation and no Russian crime can push us off this path. Today we managed to release six more of our citizens from Russian captivity. I am thankful to everyone who ensures this work! Today we have new results on the frontline. Today we received additional elements of aid from partners. It will continue to be so. Tomorrow is another day of our struggle, another day on the path to victory. Will it be special for us? It will be another day that will bring us closer to security and peace, to restoration of our territorial integrity. Because millions of Ukrainians fight and work for this. A special meeting of the National Security and Defense Council, which I convened, will take place tomorrow. There will be decisions. We know how to react to any Russian actions. And finally. This morning I honored the memory of all the victims of the Babyn Yar. Eternal memory to the victims of Nazism! Eternal damnation to those who repeat the crimes of the Nazis! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! And all our friends and allies! De facto allies. Today, here in Kyiv, in the heart of our country, we are taking a decisive step for the security of the entire community of free nations. We see who threatens us. Who is ready to kill and maim. Who in order to expand his zone of control does not stop at any savagery. On February 24, the first full-scale attack on Ukraine was carried out. The first! Russia would not have stopped at our borders if we had not stopped it. Other states would have been under attack. The Baltic countries, Poland, Moldova and Georgia, Kazakhstan... Russia claimed to subjugate various nations of Europe and Asia. Claimed six months ago. This criminal ambition is breaking down in Ukraine. It was broken down in the suburbs of Kyiv and Chernihiv. In \"Azovstal\". In the Sumy region and Kharkiv region. On Zmiinyi Island. It will be broken down in Donbas and in the south of Ukraine when we liberate them. Definitely - in Crimea, in the free Ukrainian Crimea. The entire territory of our country will be liberated from this enemy - the enemy not only of Ukraine, but also of life itself, humanity, law and truth. Russia already knows this. It feels our power. It sees that it is here, in Ukraine, that we prove the strength of our values. And that is why it is in a hurry. Organizes this farce with the attempted annexation. Tries to steal something that does not belong to it. Wants to rewrite history and redraw borders with murders, torture, blackmail and lies. Ukraine will not allow that. Today I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The meeting of the National Security and Defense Council has just ended. We have a decision. First – it is only the path of strengthening Ukraine and ousting the occupiers from our entire territory that restores peace. We will complete this path. Second – Ukraine was and remains a leader in negotiation efforts. It was our state that always offered Russia to reach an agreement on coexistence on equal, honest, decent and fair terms. It is obvious that this is impossible with this Russian president. He does not know what dignity and honesty are. Therefore, we are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but already with another president of Russia. And third – we must de jure record everything we have already achieved de facto. It is in Ukraine that the fate of democracy in the confrontation with tyranny is being decided. It is here, with the firmness of our state borders, that we can secure the firmness of the borders of all European states. We can guarantee that no one else will dare to bring war back to our continent. It is here, in Ukraine, that the values of our Euro-Atlantic community have obtained real vital energy. The strength of the nation that fights for freedom, and the strength of the nations that help in this fight. We are de facto allies. This has already been achieved. De facto, we have already completed our path to NATO. De facto, we have already proven interoperability with the Alliance’s standards, they are real for Ukraine - real on the battlefield and in all aspects of our interaction. We trust each other, we help each other and we protect each other. This is what the Alliance is. De facto. Today, Ukraine is applying to make it de jure. Under a procedure consistent with our significance for the protection of our entire community. Under an accelerated procedure. We know it's possible. We have seen Finland and Sweden start accession to the Alliance this year without a Membership Action Plan. This is fair. This is also fair for Ukraine. This is the consolidation at the level of the treaty of what has already been achieved in life and what are our values. We understand that this requires the consensus of all members of the Alliance. We understand that it is necessary to reach such a consensus. And therefore, while this is happening, we offer to implement our proposals regarding security guarantees for Ukraine and all of Europe in accordance with the Kyiv Security Compact, which was developed and presented to our partners. Security has no alternatives. But determination is needed to guarantee it. We are taking our decisive step by signing Ukraine's application for accelerated accession to NATO. Today, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine adopted a decision to impose sanctions on significant individuals and legal entities of Russia who did not have the courage to speak out in defense of humanity and international law, or who in one way or another are involved in aggressive steps against Ukraine and the community of democratic nations. And at the same time, I am addressing the people's deputies of Ukraine: at the next session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, a draft law on the nationalization of all Russian assets will be considered, which should significantly simplify this procedure. Please endorse this bill without delay. We are completing the dismantling of Russian influence on Ukraine, Europe and the world. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! The enemy started this day with a deliberate and absolutely premeditated murder of Ukrainians in Zaporizhzhia. A missile attack on a civilian convoy of cars. As of now, 30 dead are reported. Almost a hundred wounded and traumatized. The Russian military knew where their missiles would hit. Non-humans did it. From the first to the last. From the one who gave this order and to everyone who executed this order. They will answer. For sure. Before the law and before people. People! That is why we are confident of our victory. That is why we took the initiative in the war. That is why we're getting tangible results on the battlefield right now... and that's very important. Congratulations to the heroes! As we remain human and gain support from people – from all the people of the world. From everyone who feels pain when they learn about the deliberate killing of innocent people. Another farce took place in Moscow today. Something was celebrated there. They were chanting something there. They sang in the square. They were talking about Zaporizhzhia... When they themselves arranged such a thing in Zaporizhzhia. They are non-humans. Eternal memory to all those killed in Russian terrorist attacks! Today, Ukraine made decisions to defend itself. All of them will be implemented. Decisions of the National Security and Defense Council and the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Headquarters. I already reported in detail this afternoon about our request for an accelerated accession to join NATO. And about the obvious readiness of Ukraine for negotiations with the Russian Federation – but with another President of Russia, who will understand what is happening. Now, I want to add something about the decision of the National Security and Defense Council regarding sanctions against Russian individuals and legal entities. There is a really long list, quite famous names. However, we are not focused on volume, but on actually dismantling Russian influence and at the same time influencing the state of affairs in the Russian Federation itself. Therefore, restrictions are introduced against several thousand individuals and entities. Sanctions of Ukraine and our partners are synchronized. New sanctions are being introduced against key persons and significant Russian enterprises. Of course, sanctions will also be applied to those citizens of other countries who took part in the Russian farce on the occupied territory of our country. Pseudo-referendums are elements of aggression against a sovereign state, and anyone involved in organizing or conducting this farce will be held accountable. Today, I spoke with the Prime Ministers of Japan and Denmark. Of course, they condemned the new Russian steps towards escalation. Thanks to them for their support! Thanks also to all the leaders of the partner states, to all the political and public figures of the world, who have already quite promptly spoken out in defense of Ukraine and international law! I personally thank President Biden, Congress, our friends in Europe and everyone who is already strengthening sanctions against Russia and is already taking powerful steps to increase defense and financial support for Ukraine! We must liberate our entire land, and this will be the best proof that international law and human values cannot be broken by any terrorist state, even one as insolent as Russia. We have substantial results in the east of our country. There is already enough public information about this. Everyone has heard what is happening in Lyman, Donetsk region. These are steps that mean a lot to us. And I am thankful to all our fighters for implementing this element of our defense plan! It is very important. Today, I especially want to recognize the fighters of the 10th separate mountain assault brigade and the 54th separate mechanized brigade for their constant bravery and heroism in the Siversky and Bakhmut areas. And also our servicemen of the 214th separate rifle battalion, the Special Operations Forces and the 103rd separate ground defense brigade for the liberation of Yampil. I am also thankful to our intelligence units – Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense, as well as the Security Service of Ukraine. The path of our country is difficult. The path is clear. This is the path of independence, territorial integrity, integration with the civilized world and social development. The path of our enemy is also completely clear – defeat, shame and condemnation. And one more. Every year on the last day of September, Ukraine celebrates Adoption Day. This, in my opinion, is an important day. It is a day of special respect for those whose hearts are big enough to give family warmth to children left without parental care. Today, I thank all such Ukrainian men and women! I dream that we will come to such a result, when every child of Ukraine will feel family warmth, no matter what the circumstances of life are. Eternal glory to our beautiful people! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! We work for one thing – victory! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Dear all our defenders! Another week of our war for our independence comes to an end. The week that the enemy really wanted to make especially hard for us, but he made it really hard, but for himself. For Russia itself. Today, even more voices in the world have joined in condemning the pseudo-referendums and Russia's attempt to annex our territory – the territory of Ukraine. I am grateful for every such voice. As a result, we already have dozens of statements that clearly support Ukraine and international law and condemn Russia for this new aggressive step. I would like to especially note the statement of UN Secretary General António Guterres. He bluntly said that Russia violates the goals and principles of the UN, the UN Charter and that the pseudo-referendums and attempted annexation will have no legal force. When such words are heard at the highest level in the UN, everyone in the world understands everything. And Russia has no such veto right that can stop or cancel this understanding of the world. Russia is losing the fight for the international community. The world will not allow a return to the times of colonial conquests, criminal annexations and total arbitrariness instead of international law. And the main thing... The main thing is our resistance with you, our protection with you, our movement with you towards the liberation of the entire Ukrainian territory. It is our movement that puts everything in its place. Russia has staged a farce in Donbas. An absolute farce, which it wanted to present as an alleged referendum. They depicted something there, drove machine gunners around the houses, carried pieces of paper, the propagandists filmed all this in the part of Donbas they controlled. And now a Ukrainian flag is there. During this week, there were more Ukrainian flags in Donbas. It will be even more in a week. What then is a pseudo-referendum? Are there two Donetsk regions? Two villages of Yampil, Donetsk region? Are there two villages of Torske? The Ukrainian movement will continue. The Ukrainian flag is already in Lyman, Donetsk region. Fighting is still going on there. But there is no trace of any pseudo-referendum there. It is logical for Ukraine. And for the enemy, there will be more and more such \"mismatches.\" By the way, they have already started biting each other there: they are looking for the culprits, accusing some generals of failures... This is the first bell that should be heard at all levels of the Russian government. Until you all solve the problem with the one who started it all, who started this senseless for Russia war against Ukraine, you will be eliminated one by one, making scapegoats, so as not to admit that this war is a historical mistake for Russia. Ukraine will return its own. Both in the east and in the south. And what they tried to annex now, and Crimea, which has been called annexed since 2014. Our flag will be everywhere. There will be punishment for those who committed this crime of aggression against our independent state. On October 1, 76 years ago, the Nuremberg Tribunal ended its work. In many ways, it was this process that laid the foundations of the modern world – the legal foundations of justice. Everything that ruscism is trying to destroy. Therefore, another tribunal will inevitably take place, which will put an end to the careers of all those responsible for this Russian \"special operation\" against the international system, which began in 2014 and became full-scale on February 24, and will end thanks to the heroism of our people. Today, we still do not know on which day it will happen. But we know that the day of our victory will come. It will definitely be. And after it the day of judgment for the ruscists will be. It will definitely be. I thank everyone who brings this time closer. Who is approaching it daily. Thanks to everyone who fights and works for our victory! Thanks to everyone who helps! Thank you to President Biden and the US Congress for providing more than $12 billion in supplemental support. It will definitely strengthen our common freedom. Glory to the invincible people of Ukraine! Glory to our soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health! Important events took place today in Turkey during a visit of the First Lady of Ukraine, the head of the President's Office and other our representatives. In the presence of Olena, the first corvette for our country from those, which will be built by the Turkish side, was launched. It is corvette Hetman Ivan Mazepa. Its building began in 2021 and will be completed in due time. I consider it very symbolic that it got this name. Despite a century of Russian false propaganda, historical truth and justice still prevail. And there is no reason for our project to build a new fleet for Ukraine to fail. We will implement all the shaped plans. Our goal is to create a full-fledged base for ship maintenance and building in Ukraine. Today, Andriy Yermak together with the Ukrainian delegation visited the facilities of the Baykar company, which produces, in particular, well-known Bayraktar UCAVs for us. On behalf of all Ukrainians, Andriy thanked the company's managers and presented Selçuk Bayraktar, the chairman of the Baykar's Board, with the Order of Merit, which was awarded to him on the anniversary of Ukraine's Independence. However, this meeting is not symbolic, it is quite practical. We are preparing to create a training center and a plant of the Baykar company in Ukraine, as well as joint manufacturing of aircraft engines. We will definitely implement these projects. Ukraine has always been and will be one of the European centers of the military and aviation industry. And I am proud that I can say these words with absolute confidence and justification based on the results of the 221st day of Russia's full-scale war against our state. Something went wrong with someone... And these meetings are not the end of our diplomatic activity today. There was also a meeting of the first ladies of Ukraine and Turkey – and I thank President Erdoğan and his wife Emine for their continued support of our efforts to restore peace. The First Lady of Ukraine and our delegation met with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. Patriarch Bartholomew's view on the war unleashed by Russia and his position on supporting our state are well known. And today they sounded again – very powerfully. I thank you for this, thank you for understanding the needs of our people. The head of the Office held talks with the advisors to the President of the United States and the President of Turkey – Jake Sullivan and İbrahim Kalın. Very substantive negotiations. Absolutely in the interests of Ukraine. To strengthen our security. Today, I held talks with President of France Emmanuel Macron. We discussed in detail the situation on the front line, our successes at the front. President Macron clearly supported our state and condemned the Russian pseudo-referendums and the attempt to annex our territory. The strengthening of sanctions against Russia was discussed. We also discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the abduction of Director General of the ZNPP Ihor Murashov by the Russian occupiers. This is another manifestation of completely frank Russian terror, for which the terrorist state must bear an ever-increasing punishment. Today, we have a powerful joint statement from the leaders of nine NATO states: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. They condemned Russia's escalating moves and, most importantly, supported our aspiration to become a full member of NATO. We are moving in this direction. I am sure that we will implement this project. At least twice a day – in the morning and in the evening – I receive reports from our military. This week, the largest part of the reports is the list of settlements liberated from the enemy as part of our defense operation. The story of the liberation of Lyman in Donetsk region has now become the most popular in the media. But the successes of our soldiers are not limited to Lyman. This, you know, is the trend... Recently, someone somewhere held pseudo-referendums, and when the Ukrainian flag is returned, no one remembers the Russian farce with some pieces of paper and some annexations. Except, of course, law enforcement agencies of Ukraine. Because everyone who is involved in any elements of aggression against our state will be accountable for it. And I thank everyone who brings these moments of victory closer, who returns the Ukrainian flag to its rightful place on Ukrainian land. I thank everyone: from generals to ordinary soldiers, from professional soldiers, intelligence and special forces to volunteers and everyone who helps defend our state. And I would especially like to mention the 25th, 80th, 81st, and 95th brigades of amphibious assault troops for their successes in the east of our country; 14th and 92nd separate mechanized brigades; 1st, 4th and 17th tank brigades; Special Operations Forces; units of the National Guard and the National Police; SBU employees; and our intelligence – Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense. Thank you, warriors! And one more thing. Today, two professional holidays are celebrated in Ukraine – Teacher's Day (Educator's Day) and Territorial Defense Forces Day. Of course, a lot of kind and warm words have already been said to both educators and our Territorial Defense Forces men. But I want to add something. Effective defense is impossible without good national education. And there will be no good national education without effective defense. Fortunately, we have both of these elements. Thanks to the professionalism and conscientiousness of Ukrainian educators, teachers, and professors, we have soldiers who know what humanity is and appreciate everything that Ukraine represents. And thanks to our brave soldiers, Ukrainian education on Ukrainian land will transmit our values to all generations of our people. I thank every Ukrainian educator, teacher and lecturer! I thank each of our defenders! I'm thankful to the soldiers of the 127th Territorial Defense Brigade for defending the city of Kharkiv and liberating the territory of Kharkiv region. To the soldiers of the 110th brigade, who bravely repulsed the invaders in the Zaporizhzhia direction. To the soldiers of the 129th brigade of my native Kryvy Rih, who distinguished themselves with good results and liberated, in particular, Arkhanhelske and Myroliubivka. To the soldiers of the 115th Territorial Defense Brigade, who made a significant contribution to the defense of Zhytomyr region. And also to the soldiers of the 117th brigade, who defend the north-eastern direction in Sumy region. Ukraine will win! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today, I will also begin my address with a message about what happened in Türkiye. Finally, we managed to organize a meeting of our boys, commanders from \"Azovstal\", with their relatives. The meeting is in Türkiye, where our warriors stay in accordance with the agreement on their release. They are completely safe – with the guarantees of President of Türkiye Erdoğan. They are provided with proper conditions. And now they can see their relatives. They have not seen each other for many months. And now I thank everyone who made it possible for them to be with their families again. And we will do everything to make such a meeting possible for the families of all Ukrainians who are still in Russian captivity one day – a meeting with their relatives. Ukraine appreciates people. Saves people. And helps all those who need help. These are fundamental rules for our state. And it will always be so. A large group of our officials continues the work on providing the necessary assistance to all those released from Russian captivity. As you understand, there are a lot of issues. This is not only treatment and rehabilitation, but also a large volume of social issues, often legal. The state will certainly help solve all of them. At the same time, everything is being done quite intensively at various levels of government to restore normal life in the areas liberated from the occupiers. In total, these are more than 450 settlements in the Kharkiv region alone – those that were liberated thanks to the defense operation that began in September and is still ongoing. The work of transport, post office, police, normal supply of water, gas, electricity is being restored – as much as possible. The occupiers left many mined areas, many tripwires, almost all infrastructure was destroyed. The damage is colossal. But life is returning – it is returning wherever the occupiers were driven out. We also make social payments – pensions, salaries. In particular, to the teachers who remained loyal to Ukraine and did not switch to the curriculum of the occupiers. This is actually very important. Russian propagandists intimidate people in the areas still under the control of the occupiers that Ukraine will allegedly consider almost everyone who remains in the occupied territory as collaborators. Absolute nonsense. Our approach has always been and remains clear and fair. If a person did not serve the occupiers and did not betray Ukraine, then there is no reason to consider such a person a collaborator. These are elementary things. If the teacher remained a Ukrainian teacher and did not lie to the children about who is the enemy... Or if a person remained a Ukrainian employee of the Ukrainian utilities service and, for example, helped preserve the energy supply for people, then such a person cannot be blamed for anything. Hundreds of thousands of our people were in the temporarily occupied territory. Many helped our military and special services. Many simply tried to survive and waited for the return of the Ukrainian flag. Of course, there were those who betrayed Ukraine. But such cases are quickly established by the Security Service of Ukraine and are not massive. Russia did not meet mass support in Ukraine, and this is a fact. Today, the offensive movement of our army and all our defenders continued. There are new liberated settlements in several regions. Fierce fighting continues in many areas of the front. But the perspective of these hostilities remains obvious - more and more occupiers are trying to escape, more and more losses are being inflicted on the enemy army, and there is a growing understanding that Russia made a mistake by starting a war against Ukraine. Of course, there are many fanatics out there. Those who will never admit the obvious, that this is a pointless war for Russia that Russia cannot win. Because it is impossible to defeat a nation that preserves unity and knows what they are fighting for. The same cannot be said about the people of Russia as about the Ukrainian people. None of those who are now being sent to war after criminal mobilization will be able to explain: what is the point of this for him personally? Why should he risk his life? Among the dead occupiers we can already see those who were taken just a week or two ago. People were not trained for combat, they have no experience to fight in such a war. But the Russian command just needs some people - any kind - to replace the dead. And when these new ones die, more people will be sent. This is how Russia fights. That's how it will lose as well. No sham referenda, announcements about annexations, conversations about the borders they invented and drew somewhere, will help them. There is a clear and internationally recognized border of Ukraine. There are lives we must protect. There is security we must restore. And all this will happen. We are doing all this. And one more thing. Today, Russia was ultimately removed from decision-making in world aviation. There will be no more representatives of the terrorist state in the governing body – the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization. This is a crucially important world institution, a specialized agency of the UN, and this is a quite eloquent signal to all other international organizations. A state that has violated so many norms of international law cannot be kept in any international organizations as a supposedly normal participant. Russia has no place in the global community. I thank everyone who helps us defend freedom! Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we’ve got some good news both from the frontline and from the diplomatic front. First: the Ukrainian army is carrying out a pretty fast and powerful advance in the south of our country as part of the current defense operation. Dozens of settlements have already been liberated from the Russian sham referendum this week alone. In Kherson region, Kharkiv region, Luhansk region and Donetsk region altogether. In particular, according to the military reports from the Kherson region: the settlements of Lyubymivka, Khreshchenivka, Zolota Balka, Bilyaivka, Ukrainka, Velyka and Mala Oleksandrivka, and Davydiv Brid were liberated from the occupier and stabilized. And this is far from a complete list... Our warriors do not stop. And it's only a matter of time before we oust the occupier from all our land. I’ve held a series of important negotiations today. First, in the afternoon, I spoke with the Prime Minister of India. I informed Mr. Modi about the situation on the frontline, about the success of our military. I presented in detail our view of Russia's recent escalation steps. It is the Kremlin that is doing absolutely everything for this war to end only on the battlefield, not at the negotiating table. Russia responds to various Ukrainian proposals to stop aggression and liberate our territory with terror, criminal mobilization and political farce. And this is a threat to any state in any part of the world. After all, if someone tries to steal the territory of a neighboring people, then some others may have a similar desire. And that is why we call on all subjects of international relations who respect international law to stand up for its basic principles and confirm their respect, in particular, for the principle of the inviolability of borders and the territorial integrity of states. I believe this is the same fundamental principle for India as it is for Ukraine. Also this afternoon I spoke with Giorgia Meloni, leader of the Brothers of Italy political force that won the recent elections by a landslide. It was a very substantive conversation on the ways to further increase our interstate cooperation and strengthen our capabilities - both of Ukraine and Italy. On behalf of all Ukrainians, I thanked Italy for the powerful packages of defense support. We are looking forward to Mrs. Meloni’s official visit to Kyiv. And in the evening I spoke with U.S. President Biden. First of all, I thanked him for another package of defense support for our country, in particular for new HIMARS. And in general, I noted that the successes of our military - all successes in returning freedom to our people - are our joint successes, our joint victories. Due to the unity of Ukraine, the United States of America and all our partners in the free world, today freedom has the highest strength in decades and demonstrates concrete victories in the confrontation with tyranny. Of course, the key aspects of our cooperation outside the defense sphere were also discussed with President Biden, in particular financial support - in particular, the support package in the amount of more than 12 billion dollars. We also discussed political steps, cooperation in international organizations. And I was especially pleased to hear President Biden's words that our servicemen inspire the whole world, our people inspire the whole world. And rightly so. Our victory in this war will show how much Ukraine can contribute to the global strength of freedom, the global strength of democracy. I thank everyone who fights and works for our victory! Today, I would especially like to celebrate the concerted and heroic actions of the warriors of the 35th separate marine brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Ostrogradsky, the 46th separate assault brigade and the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade named after Kosh otaman Kost Hordiyenko. Thank you guys! And I always thank everyone who helps our defenders protect freedom! And one more important emphasis. I signed a decree designating null and void all decrees of the President of the Russian Federation and all acts adopted to implement these decrees for attempted annexation of our territory from 2014 until today. Any Russian decisions, any treaties with which they try to seize our land - all this is worthless. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. Fabius! Ladies and Gentlemen! I thank you for the opportunity to present our Ukrainian perspective on how law can guarantee peace. I will start with one example. An example, which demonstrates the need for a comprehensive legal response to aggression. September 30 of this year. Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine. Morning - 7:10 am. The Russian army fires 16 missiles at the territory of the region and the city of Zaporizhzhia. Of them, 4 missiles are shot down by our air defense forces. 9 missiles hit one of the plants, the enterprise was destroyed. And 3 more Russian missiles hit the checkpoint on the road - the place where dozens of people were. Ordinary people in ordinary cars. A total of 122 people were wounded that morning. 30 people died. Including 2 children. The girl was 10 years old. And the boy, he was 14 years old. And this is just one Russian missile strike. A deliberate attack on civilians. A deliberate crime. This is one of thousands of strikes that have occurred since 2014, when Russia began its aggression against Ukraine, and since February 24 of this year, when Russia turned this aggression into a full-scale war. You all know what is happening in Ukraine. All of you have heard about Bucha and Mariupol, about burned cities and tortured people. And I think many of you have read or heard words that explain very clearly why all this is happening. I will quote these words now: \"To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\" End of quote. These are wise words. The words of people who saw full-scale war with their own eyes. They saw - and know that all war crimes begin with one original crime - the crime of aggression. What is the missile strike at ordinary people in ordinary cars at a checkpoint somewhere in the middle of the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine? This is the crime committed by the specific Russian soldiers who launched the missiles. This is the crime of the specific commander who ordered the missile strike. And this is the crime of those who started the armed aggression against Ukraine, in the framework of which this and thousands of other similar strikes became possible. And also - in the framework of which the execution of civilians, the torture and execution of prisoners, the rape of women and children, airstrikes on ordinary residential buildings, the use of prohibited mines and ammunition became possible. All the crimes of the Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil can be investigated and the perpetrators can be brought to justice. All perpetrators! But... We must bring to justice those whose decisions started all this. Those who committed the original crime. A crime in which all the evil shown by the Russian occupiers is concentrated. And we still do not have such an institutional basis to hold the Russian political and military leadership accountable for the crime of aggression. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine offers a real way to bring to justice the perpetrators of the original crime that spawned all other crimes committed since the beginning of Russian aggression. For many years, the world has been looking for ways to prevent the recurrence of a full-scale war in Europe and to ensure the inevitability of punishment for war criminals, whoever they are, wherever they are and wherever they commit crimes against the basics of human life. Thanks to these searches and the efforts of many conscientious people, we now have, in particular, the International Criminal Court - one of the most important global legal institutions that ensures justice and protects humanity. Ukraine fully supports the activities of this court. We accepted the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court over all events on the territory of Ukraine. We introduced changes in the legislation of Ukraine to simplify and make our cooperation with this court more effective. We are in constant and quite practical communication with representatives of the International Criminal Court in order to achieve the common goal of bringing the Russian occupiers to justice for the crimes committed by them on the territory of Ukraine. I am grateful to all states and specialists who contribute to this work - with their financial, technical, analytical, legal and expert support. I am grateful to France, in particular, whose contribution is already tangible. And I believe that the International Criminal Court will be able to create a historical precedent of an absolutely legal response to the crimes committed by the Russian occupiers, as large-scale as the Russian war against Ukraine. But for the original crime of armed aggression to receive a fair answer as well, we must supplement the activities of the International Criminal Court. A Special Tribunal should be established for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. So that it can punish those who, unfortunately, cannot be reached by the International Criminal Court and all other available judicial institutions of the world. You all know how the leadership of Russia, hiding behind false stories about state sovereignty, avoids fair responsibility for what it has done. We have to overcome that. The draft of the corresponding international agreement for the establishment of the Special Tribunal was recently presented in Kyiv to diplomats from our partner countries. However, we offer this agreement not only to our partners, but also to everyone in the world who values international law and order. I will give you another quote: “The charges in the Indictment that the defendants planned and waged aggressive wars are charges of the utmost gravity. War is essentially an evil thing. Its consequences are not confined to the belligerent States alone, but affect the whole world.” End of quote. When we conclude an agreement and establish a Special Tribunal for Russian aggression, the very fact of preparing indictments and issuing arrest warrants for those who planned and ordered the beginning of this aggression will be the most powerful signal to all other potential aggressors in the world that war is inevitably punished, and the guilty are held accountable; that the law is always valid and the law always prevails; and humanity is guaranteed to be protected. That is why we say that law can guarantee peace and justice. It can! To all. But only if we create the necessary institution. And I invite France, in particular, your Constitutional Council to actively participate in the negotiations on the establishment of the Special Tribunal. And one more thing. Something without which post-war justice is simply impossible. This is the compensation for all losses and destruction. Already now, in October, we offer everyone who values international law to support a fundamental resolution at the UN General Assembly. A resolution confirming Russia's international legal obligation to pay reparations for this war and recognizing the need for a compensation mechanism through which such an obligation can be implemented. The aggressor must fully pay for the cruelty and destruction he unleashed. And although it is not easy in the case of Russia, it is quite possible. The corresponding order of legal steps is clear. We can present it to all interested parties. And I will now add one more quote: \"Crimes against International Law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of International Law be enforced.\" End of quote. Probably, you have read or heard these and other words that I have just given - they are from the verdict of the Nuremberg trials. The trials established by an international treaty. The trials that punished the perpetrators of the previous full-scale war in Europe and proved that justice exists in the world. All of us who have studied jurisprudence have seen and analyzed this fundamental document – the Nuremberg verdict. And I am sure that there will be times when students who study law in the same way will be able to compare the text of the Nuremberg verdict with the text of the verdict that will be passed by the Special Tribunal regarding the crime of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. But not only. They will also study the experience of Russia’s compensation for all the losses caused by this war. So, colleagues! Friends! I invite all of you to participate in the establishment of appropriate legal institutions. Anyone who joins in restoring justice now will join in guaranteeing long-term peace for all of us in Europe and the world. No chance for the guilty! No chance for aggression! Let the law prevail. Thank you for your attention! Thank you, France, for your support. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. The main item on the agenda is our movement towards the liberation of all Ukrainian land and everything that is necessary for the implementation of our defense operation. The supply of weapons and ammunition, interaction with partners, material provision, countering new types of weapons that the occupiers have... Of course, I cannot disclose specific issues that were discussed by the Staff. But most of the reports, accepted reports and approved plans will definitely please Ukrainians. And they will definitely upset the occupiers. Because they will be responsible for all their evil. They will be responsible before our weapons, the Ukrainian court and international law. None of them will avoid it. By the way, today I want to celebrate the personnel of the operative-strategic group \"Oleksandriya\" for creating conditions for a successful offensive, for planning and preparing active actions in the Kherson region. Those of our actions that already yield a tangible result. And there will be more. Only during this day in the Kherson region, such settlements as Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka were liberated from the sham referendum and stabilized. The movement continues. I also want to celebrate the warriors of our Air Forces, who today managed to shoot down six Iranian-made drones that the occupiers tried to use against our cities. Three drones were shot down by anti-aircraft troops of the 302nd anti-aircraft missile Kharkiv regiment, and three more were shot down by our fighter pilots from the 204th Sevastopol tactical aviation brigade. Thanks for the precision, guys! And now I will address the occupiers. Even if you find some other weapon somewhere in the world with the same “natural” name for your “Russian world”, like these Iranian “Shahed”, with which you are trying to bomb our cities, such as Bila Tserkva... It won't help you anyway. You have already lost. You’ve lost because even now, on the 224th day of the full-scale war, you have to explain to your society why all this is needed: this war, the false mobilization and self-destruction of all the prospects of your people. When people feel they are right and when they are on their own land, they themselves know everything. They do not need fanatic lectures on \"alternative history\" and political information sessions every day - either at a meeting with teachers, or at a meeting about the progress of seasonal harvesting work. Ukrainians know what they are fighting for. And more and more citizens of Russia are realizing that they must die simply because one person does not want to end the war. It's obvious who will win. Today in Lyman, Sviatohirsk and Yarova of the Donetsk region, another sign of the return to normal life was added - we resumed the payment of pensions there. We also provide food kits and humanitarian aid. The return of the Ukrainian flag means that a peaceful and socially secure life is once again possible for Donbas and all other territories that were temporarily occupied by Russia. Today, we have several events that strongly confirm the world's faith in the future of Ukraine, the world's trust in our strength. First, we are starting Ukraine's accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It is one of the most prestigious global organizations, it unites 38 strongest states. These are democracies, these are market economies, this is the majority of the world's economic potential. From Austria to Japan, from the United States of America to South Korea, from Canada to Türkiye. Ukraine will be among them in this format as well. We submitted our application for admission, it was endorsed by the Organization. Ukraine received the special status of the acceding country. And we will fulfill all the necessary conditions for full membership. And already this year, the regional office of the Organization will start working in Kyiv. For us, this will mean another powerful line of economic, technological and value cooperation with the global community. The second event: together with our friends - Spain and Portugal - we submit a bid to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup. This is our joint bid. The chances of its success are quite high. And it's not just that our countries meet the criteria that must be complied with in order to gain the right to host the championship. The point is also that it will be very symbolic when three countries of the European Union: Spain, Portugal and Ukraine, will be able to hold the World Cup together. I spoke today with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. A very positive conversation. I thanked him for his support. We coordinated our next joint steps and interaction. I had a very substantive meeting in the afternoon regarding our preparations for the winter season. We are fully aware of all risks. And we know that the occupiers are also... preparing for winter. At all levels of government, scenarios are being worked out to protect people. We speak honestly: winter will be difficult. But in order to endure it, we accumulate gas, coal and everything else that is necessary. We are working to be ready. And it is important that our partners approach this period with the same preparedness. The more we do together now to bring peace closer, the more we cooperate and put pressure on Russia, the safer this winter can be for all of us in Europe. I will talk about this in particular tomorrow in my speech at the first summit of the European political community, which will be held in Prague. In addition, tomorrow I will speak with representatives of one of the most esteemed think tanks in the English-speaking world - the Lowy Institute in Australia. There will be other diplomatic activities. I thank everyone who fights and works for our victory! I thank everyone who helps Ukraine and puts pressure on Russia for peace! We will definitely win. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Secretary-General! Dear representatives of the free nations of America! Dear friends! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you at this particular time when we have entered a defining phase of our war for independence – when our heroes drive the occupying army out of our land.  Russia sent this army to our country to turn us into their colony. As it was, unfortunately, before – in the time of empires. But millions of Ukrainians stood up to defend our freedom and our country and will definitely not allow Russia to bring back that old unfair time. We have no doubts about winning this war and our ability to protect the independence of Ukraine. Daily victories at the front and dozens of liberated Ukrainian cities and villages prove it. There is only one question for us right now – how many of our people Russia will manage to kill before it admits a defeat. How much more will Russia manage to steal from Ukraine – grain; resources; industrial enterprises, which the occupiers simply disassemble and take out to Russia; as well as people. They are stealing people. More than one million and six hundred thousands of Ukrainians were forcibly deported to Russia. They are dispersed across the territory of this state, scattered throughout remote Russian regions.  Many of them had their documents taken away, and many of them passed through terrible Russia's filtration camps, where they were abused and intimidated. These are people. But for Russia, it is also a resource. We are doing everything to free our land as soon as possible, to save all our people from this invasion as fast as we can. We are doing everything to put an end to the long list of Ukrainian victims that Russia is creating. This is the reason I am addressing you. We need your support to bring back peace faster for our people. I will be honest – I know that in some member countries of your Organization, unfortunately, the Russian view of this war is dominant. And this is a false view. It is possible in your part of the world simply due to the fact that Russia spends billions of dollars annually on its propaganda media and other projects that create an illusory impression about it. But there are facts on the side of Ukraine. And I am asking you just to look at these facts. Look – from your point of view. In terms of what your great American continent has been through. From the point of view of the struggle for independence that your people led. In terms of simple human justice, which means so much to your countries and people. And in terms of what your national heroes fought for. I am turning to the pages of the history of the American continent and asking: On whose side would Simon Bolivar be in such a war that Russia unleashed against Ukraine? Who would Jose de San Martin support? Who would Miguel Hidalgo sympathize with? I think they would not help someone who is just looting a smaller country as a typical colonizer. I think they would not support someone who constantly lies and does not even call a war a war, hiding behind the definition of \"special military operation\".  I think they would not sympathize with someone who deliberately puts different countries on the brink of starvation – through an artificial food crisis. Who drives people into poverty – through price and energy crisis, both artificial. And who is so mean that he makes war against civilians, destroying all the foundations of normal social life using rockets and artillery against residential buildings, hospitals, schools, churches. I thank those of you who have already strongly supported Ukraine and condemned Russian war against our freedom and independence. I thank your Organization for suspending Russia's observer status. But we need more for the sake of peace and for the Russian army to leave all captured Ukrainian land. So I am asking you to support us on several levels. The first level – international organizations, particularly the UN General Assembly. Please support us in voting to condemn Russia's aggressive policy. It is of our common interest – so that no one in the world can start wars of aggression like the Russian war against Ukraine. And so that no one in the world thinks that he has right to illegally annex lands of other nations, as Russia thinks. The second level is national. We need integrity from your states. Do not allow your economies to be used to finance criminal war and war crimes. Do not associate yourself with those who will inevitably be condemned by the international community. The crime of Russia's aggression against our country, the mass murders of civilians on Ukrainian soil, forced deportations, numerous cases of torture and rape – all this will certainly receive its verdicts. Please avoid your companies and countries to be connected with those individuals and legal entities in Russia through which it carries out its terror against Ukraine. Support sanctions against Russia. Limit your trade operations with Russia. Protect yourself from the risk of tarnishing your reputation with ties to a terrorist state and its companies, and limit its opportunities to continue this war of aggression against Ukraine. And the third level of support we need – is the level of ordinary people. I'm not asking for much. Just spread the truth about this war and the casualties caused by the Russian aggression. Just talk about it. Let your people know what evil Russia has brought to the absolutely peaceful Ukrainian people. A nation that has never started any wars of aggression. The greater the support for those who fight for freedom and independence – the stronger freedom will be in general in the world and the faster we will go all the way to freeing our land from the Russian invaders. I thank you for your attention! Long live freedom! ¡Viva la Libertad!"

  "speech": "Thank you very much, dear Mr. Lowy! Dear Mr. Fullilove! Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for this opportunity to address you today and answer the most pressing questions of our time. A time that has such a strong connection with the past. Almost 8 years ago, in November 2014, here in Sydney, at the Lowy Institute, you had a speech by Angela Merkel, then Federal Chancellor of Germany. She in particular touched upon the topic of the Russian war against Ukraine - the criminal annexation of our Crimea, hostilities in Donbas and destruction of the Malaysian Boeing in the sky over Ukraine. Mrs. Merkel then noted that \"the Ukrainian crisis is really more than a regional crisis, it affects all of us.\" Let me remind you once again - these words were said almost 8 years ago, i.e. 8 years before Russia was able to turn a hybrid war against Ukraine - a war, not a crisis after all - into a full-scale invasion, the likes of which Europe has not seen since World War II. Why was this possible? Why, despite the understanding already in 2014 that Russian aggression is not something local, but really a global threat, Russia still had the possibility of such an escalation, which began on February 24 of this year? This question reveals the connection between our time with even more ancient history. With a history that still hasn't really become history. It is still with us - in the present. On September 30 of this year, the head of Russia announced the purported annexation of part of the territory of Ukraine. Four of our regions, from which the Russian occupation contingent has not yet been ousted. This new attempt by Russia to grab someone else's property is an obvious attempt to repeat 2014 - to repeat Crimea. And not just annexation as such. Russia is trying to put the international community in such conditions now that the reaction to yet another Russian crime against international law does not correspond to its severity in the same way as it did then - with Crimea. In 2014, we did not see, for example, really tough sanctions against Russia. It was not punished for this crime. At that time, there was a very strong desire among many in the world to turn a blind eye to the annexation, to consider the war simply a \"crisis\" and to continue relations with Russia. Although they said then that the threat was global, they acted as if it was something purely local… And to say that this increased the aggressor's sense of impunity is an understatement. But this always happens: when a criminal does not receive an adequate punishment for a crime he has committed, he perceives it as permission for further criminal acts. \"They are weak,\" is how the aggressor reacts when he feels no response. Will he feel it now? Knowingly or not, the Russian leader chose a very symbolic date to start this attempt to annex our territory. September 30. This day takes us back 84 years in the history of Europe and the world. It was on this day that another aggressor – yet so similar to this one – succeeded in signing the Munich Agreement. Also to annex someone else's land. Now we remember that agreement more often under the name of the \"Munich conspiracy\" and consider it an example of political cynicism and a fatal mistake. A mistake that cost humanity tens of millions of lives. But after the signing of \"Munich\", such evaluations sounded different. They even said that the agreement would give peace to the generation at that time... In different countries and with different voices, the thesis that it is possible to simply agree that the aggressor has seized something is heard again. That it is possible to draw some kind of conditional line somewhere that will satisfy Russia's appetite, and supposedly after that the war will die down. And that one should not react toughly to this annexation attempt, which Russia started on September 30. But this thesis sounds nothing but the year 2014 - the mistakes of the then leaders. It sounds like 1938. It only says that the criminal can go unpunished. And so, with the temptation to continue. Be sure - the head of Russia is now carefully analyzing the world's reaction to the sham referenda he organized on Ukrainian soil and to the announcement of the annexation of our territory. What exactly is he interested in? It’s simple: he is interested in whether he still has the potential for escalation. If the world's reaction is weak now, Russia will come up with some new escalation. You can see that the range of criminal actions of this state is very wide - missile terror, mass murders, criminal deportations, radiation blackmail at, for example, our captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, food crisis, energy crisis, etc. The recent sabotage with gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea was also very eloquent. These are actions that can destabilize life on the entire continent. This is a real energy weapon of mass destruction. Absolutely every country in the world depends on underwater cables and pipelines, which can be destroyed by an aggressor in the same way as gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea. Therefore, the world must now show strength. Strength is needed to finally put an end to aggression - to the aggressor's ability to escalate. On international platforms, a clear and principled condemnation of Russia for this attempt to annex Ukrainian territory is needed, for it to be utterly different from what happened in 2014. At the level of states and unions of states, new and tough sanctions against Russia are needed so that the situation is also dramatically different from 2014. At the level of cooperation with Ukraine, regular and demonstrative support packages are needed, primarily defensive and financial, so that the aggressor sees that his criminal actions only complicate the situation for him. Now, at a time that has such a strong connection with the past, we have a historic opportunity to set a precedent that will make the history of aggression truly history and that will teach any aggressor that no crime against international law will ever again remain unpunished. Next week, a resolution on non-recognition and condemnation of Russia's new attempt to annex our territories will be submitted to the UN General Assembly. We and Australia have long had a principled and effective cooperation at all international platforms, and in particular at the UN. And we must now direct our joint capabilities in such a way as to make the vote at the General Assembly for this resolution as unequivocal as possible. I am asking you, I am asking Australia to use all its influence to persuade as many countries as possible not to remain neutral and to vote for - for international law and against Russian annexation. Ukraine has a very meaningful defense cooperation with Australia as well. Even after my first address to the Parliament and people of Australia in March, your Government decided to provide Ukraine with bushmasters. I’m deeply grateful. These vehicles have proven themselves in real combat. The more weapons and ammunition we receive, in particular, artillery, drones, anti-aircraft defense, anti-tank and anti-ship weapons, the more tangible the responsibility for violation of international law will be for Russia and the less the aggressor will feel that he supposedly has room for escalation. The third element is sanctions. I thank Australia for participating in the global effort to impose sanctions on the aggressor for the war. But this pressure makes sense when it is constantly growing and when the aggressor does not have time to adapt to sanctions, does not have time to find ways to circumvent them. Now is the time to increase this pressure. Just now. Right after Russia staged this farce with sham referenda and this annexation. The price of such actions must be tangible, the consequences - devastating. The aggressor should have no illusions that 2014 can still happen again. And the last one. The world has seen many wars. It has seen how wars somewhere in one part of the world affect everyone in the world. It should be considered not only from the point of view of the direct negative impact of the war. But also from the point of view of the impact of its result. If the aggressor does gain a result for himself, if the aggressive ambition is satisfied, then such a result affects everyone in the world even more and even longer than the war itself. Affects by cynicism. Affects by the inevitable destruction of international law, the weakening of the truth. That is why the criminal war must end with the just defeat of the one who started it. The aggressor must lose. This is what gives peace to generations. Not any conspiracies with the aggressor, not appeasement of the aggressor, but his defeat. And therefore, the restoration of peace. And therefore, Ukraine must win. This is not just something about our state. This is about all of us in the world. This is also about Australia. About your freedom. About your security. About our common values. About our common peace. Which our victory can historically strengthen. I thank you for your attention! I thank you for the support, Australia! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear hosts of our meeting and inspirators of the idea of our meeting! Dear Prime Minister Fiala! Dear President Michel! Dear Mr. President Macron! Dear leaders of Europe! At this first meeting of ours in this format, I would like to congratulate you on the establishment of our new political initiative. I would like to congratulate you on the fact that, thanks to this initiative, we have received not just another format of cooperation in Europe, but an extremely powerful opportunity to restore peace in Europe. This gathering, the European Political Community, has a real possibility of becoming a European Community of Peace. Peace! That Ukraine needs so much. That absolutely every country presented here today needs. Currently, representatives of all existing formats of cooperation in Europe based on our common values are participating in this meeting. Here with us are those who joined the EU and those who are preparing to join. Here with us are those who are part of NATO, and those who are building cooperation with the Alliance as candidate countries or partners of NATO. Here with us are representatives of various regional associations of Europeans. And there are no representatives of Russia with us here - a state that geographically seems to belong to Europe, but from the point of view of its values and behavior is the most anti-European state in the world. We are now in a strong position to direct all possible powers of Europe to end the war and guarantee long-term peace - for Ukraine, for Europe, for the world. Ukraine never wanted this war. Ukraine did nothing to provoke it. Ukraine has always been a leader in peaceful settlement. And all of you are well informed about how much Ukraine has done to try to convince Russia to live without war. Many of you personally participated in these efforts and helped us. Helped us in almost a hundred rounds of negotiations of various levels, at which peace was offered to Russia. I thank each and every one of you for this effort. But we must admit the obvious: we are forced to deal with a state that does not want peace. Which responds to all proposals for real peace with missile strikes, provocation of artificial crises and ridicule. Russia subordinated its entire policy to only one task, namely, waging war. War against Ukraine, against Europe, against the world. Ladies and Gentlemen! Colleagues! Peace is needed! Russia kills. It kills on the battlefield in Ukraine, in our peaceful cities... And on the streets of your cities. Russian killers made attempts on people in various European countries. And organized sabotage in Europe - against warehouses with weapons, against factories, and now against gas pipelines. Russia intimidates and blackmails for the world to stop helping those it kills. It uses everything from the food crisis to radiation blackmail, from destabilizing energy markets to nuclear blackmail. All in order to break the unity of allies and partners, to intimidate nations, to make millions of people afraid and on the basis of this fear - to give in. Give up values, first of all. Our common values of freedom, democracy and the right of nations to live freely. Russia is trying to fix every danger and every manifestation of instability that it has already created. This is exactly what it calls negotiations, this is exactly how it perceives any agreements. Russia wants to redraw the borders - to once again divide the world into zones of influence, destroying our common space of cooperation and development. Russia corrupts. It corrupts with the billions it earns from trading in energy resources. This is the Russian formula for war: kill, intimidate, fix threats to free states and their losses, destroy borders and corrupt. And each of these elements is anti-European. All of them are directed against Europe. Ukraine is only the first battlefield this state has entered. And it is in Ukraine that it is necessary to defeat it. We must implement our peace formula. I presented it in my speech at the UN General Assembly. It must be fully implemented. The items of our peace formula neutralize everything that Russia does to fight. The first is to punish the aggressor. Increase sanctions against Russia. Stop any cooperation with Russia and its companies. Exclude it from all international organizations or at least suspend its membership, its ability to distort the activities of international institutions - first of all, the UN. Russia is making the United Nations a gathering of 192 who are simply forced to put up with one state lying and mocking and vetoing when it wants to block the UN's real ability to restore peace. Of course, in order to punish the aggressor, we need a Special Tribunal for the crime of aggression by Russia against Ukraine and an international compensation mechanism that will force Russia to compensate for the damages they caused. The second is aid to Ukraine. By helping us, each of your states is helping itself. Look at the battlefield in Ukraine now - it is such an intense war that the absolute majority of states simply would not be able to wage it. And that is why this war must be won now - in Ukraine. So that the Russian fleet cannot block other ports in the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea or any other sea. So that Russian tanks do not advance on Warsaw or again on Prague. So that Russian artillery does not fire at the Baltic states. So that Russian missiles do not hit the territory of Finland or any other country. Such a threat exists. We reduce such a threat every day when we destroy the occupiers in Ukraine. The third point of our peace formula is the restoration of security and territorial integrity. We do it. We do it together with you. With your help. The fourth point is security guarantees. We need security guarantees before we join NATO. And on this path. And we will do it. We will also do it together with you. Our proposals for security guarantees are presented to partners. The fifth is determination. In 225 days of full-scale war, we have all already shown that Europe can influence the issues of war and peace. But now - all together - we must ensure that the formula for war is completely blocked and the formula for peace is fully implemented. Today, Russia launched another airstrike on Ukrainian cities. It used Iranian drones again. By the way, they are used every day, and so far Iran says every day that there are allegedly no such drones here. And again hit with rockets. Unfortunately, there are victims again - dead and wounded people, burnt houses. In Zaporizhzhia, after the first missile strike today, when people came to clear the debris, Russia launched a second missile strike... Absolute meanness. Absolute evil. There have already been thousands of manifestations of such evil. Unfortunately, there may be thousands more. But the day will come when Russian evil will lose. This will be the very day when our peace formula will prevail. When we will fully use all the possibilities of our unity. Here and now, I urge you to make a basic decision. A decision about purpose for this community of ours. For this format of ours. We, the leaders of Europe, can become the leaders of peace. Our European political community can become a European community of peace. So, let's do it! And let today be the starting point. The point from which Europe and the entire free world will move to guaranteed peace for all of us. It is possible. Thank you for your attention! Thank you all for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today is the day of active diplomacy. We inform our partners about the latest manifestations of Russian terror. About missile strikes on Zaporizhzhia and other cities of Ukraine. About the use of Iranian drones against our people and infrastructure. For some reason, Iran claims that there are no Iranian-made drones in Ukraine. People see them in the sky. We shoot them down. But we are told that there are allegedly no Iranian drones in Ukraine. Well, we’ll find ways to ensure that there aren't any left indeed. We also provide information about our movement on the frontline. Since October 1, more than half a thousand square kilometers of territory and dozens of settlements have been liberated from the Russian sham referendum and stabilized only in the Kherson region. There are also successes in the eastern direction. The day will surely come when we will report on successes in the Zaporizhzhia region as well - in those areas that are still under the control of the occupiers. The day will come when we will also talk about the liberation of Crimea. This perspective is obvious. It is also obvious that there is still some way to go. There is still a lot to endure, a lot to do. Both for Ukrainians and for our partners - all who value freedom and international law. I’ve talked today with representatives of political, business and expert circles of Australia. I felt full support and interest in our victory. By the way, Australia is among the top 10 countries that provide us with defense aid. This is a very significant contribution to the protection of our state, the international legal order and humanity as such. I’ve addressed the European leaders at the summit of the European Political Community held today in Prague. I called on them to do everything so that this new format of our cooperation in Europe, which unites different states: from Iceland to Azerbaijan, from Spain to Turkey, could become not just a gathering of politicians, but a gathering of peacemakers. Europe needs a community of those who know how to protect peace and put any terrorists in their place. These days, the European Union is moving towards the introduction of the eighth package of sanctions against Russia. In particular, this package envisages limiting the sea transportation of Russian oil and creates a toolkit to limit the oil revenues of the terrorist state. This is good. But this is only the beginning. We must ensure that the terrorist state does not receive any profit from the sale of oil and gas. So that not a single oil dollar and not a single gas euro could go to the continuation of the Russian war against Ukraine and the entire civilized world. I am confident that it will be ensured in due time. And I thank all Europeans, all in the free world, who work for this result. Who promote the necessary political decisions and who create the necessary economic alternatives to Russian energy resources. I will continue working in this direction tomorrow. I will address the participants of the meeting of the European Council. Today in Kyiv I met with Samantha Power, head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID). We discussed the existing and prospective programs of our cooperation, the implementation of our plan for the rapid reconstruction of Ukraine. The main focus of these programs is security. And we will soon introduce this new security approach to our civil infrastructure to the public. I thanked Mrs. Power for allocating funds to prepare our infrastructure for the winter period, in particular heating. I held a meeting today with IAEA Head Grossi, who arrived in Kyiv. It is clear that our negotiations primarily concerned the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant captured by Russian terrorists. But in fact, this topic is much broader. It concerns not only Ukraine and not only in the context of radiation safety. Of course, any decisions of the current head of Russia regarding the Zaporizhzhia station and any attempts by Russia to transfer the station to its alleged ownership are worthless and, frankly speaking, stupid. This is a nuclear power plant. This is not some palace, Yukos or something else that the Russian leadership has already managed to steal. Only Ukrainian specialists can guarantee that there will be no radiation incidents at the Zaporizhzhia station. And it was important to hear from Mr. Grossi that the international community will only contact Ukraine regarding the ZNPP, because it is Ukrainian property. Was, is and will be. Now there are about five hundred occupiers at the station. And this is nothing but five hundred risks of disaster. The world understands this. And I am grateful for the support of everyone who is fighting for the return of full Ukrainian control over the station and for its complete demilitarization. Another aspect of this topic is electricity itself. And if the Zaporizhzhia station is not working, we in Ukraine face certain difficulties. We are getting a situation where we do not have a surplus of electricity, which we can, in particular, export to EU countries. This is a disadvantage for the people of the EU, who lose a reliable source of energy supply. This is a disadvantage for us, Ukrainians. We are honest about it. We say honestly that all of us in Europe must fight for our interests together - in complete unity. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! I thank everyone who fights and works for our victory! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear friends! Dear colleagues! First of all, I want to thank you, Charles, and I also want to thank the Czech Presidency for this opportunity and Prime Minister Fiala personally for the invitation to participate in this event. Ukraine – as it should be – together with all Europeans. This is a familiar thing for everyone now – and at our level, when we regularly meet and work together in various European formats. Also it is familiar for people in our countries – because for most Europeans, Ukraine is an integral part of the European space. The space of freedom, democracy, social development and fundamental values that unite us all. It makes Europe so attractive to many people from other parts of the world. But let's look back for a moment – to the very recent past. Just a few generations before us the European space that we have today could have been nothing more than a dream. And such a bold dream that it was very difficult to believe that it could be realized. Europe was a continent of discord, warlike ambitions, clannishness, lack of freedom, inequality, and poverty. And Europeans had to flee to other parts of the world just to survive and develop their potential. So it was. Europe has done a lot to overcome this. And even Russia will not be able to push our common continent into such a past. Although Russia openly seeks this, it spends a lot of energy, a lot of money, resources on it, fights for this and provokes anti-European crises, the impact of which is felt by everyone in Europe – from Portugal to Finland. But what gives confidence that the European path is irreversible? There is only one answer – unity. And it is the unity of not only leaders and states. Not only in the legal space. Not only in our institutions – EU institutions and others, it is not only in their work. It is very important that the unity of our perception of Europe as a task remains. Yesterday, Mr. Fiala, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, while addressing the European leaders gathered in Prague for the inaugural meeting of the new format of cooperation on our continent, recalled this image that was proposed by Václav Havel. Europe as a task. Today, at the meeting of the European Council, I would like to emphasize once again exactly this image. Because this is the source of our strength. Europe will remain exactly as it is now, as long as Europeans perceive what they have, how they live, what they received from previous generations, not as a givenness, but as a task. Peace in Europe is not a state, but a task. Our values, their popularity and strength are not a givenness, but a task. And democracy is not something that can always be, because it already exists now, it is also the task. Social development, the pursuit of equality in diversity, which distinguishes Europe from other parts of the world, is also not something that we can simply get from our parents or simply pass on to our children, it is the task. And security... Security is also not a state, not a givenness, not an inheritance that can be received or transferred, but the task. It is a constantly renewing task that can never be abandoned and that constantly needs new thoughts, steps and solutions to preserve all that you and I value so much and that is so familiar to us. And especially now – at a time when Europe is being so brutally attacked at many levels by the most anti-European state of the modern world – Russia. Russia brought war to our land – to the Ukrainian part of Europe. And only thanks to the fact that the Ukrainian people stopped this invasion of Russia, Russia cannot yet bring the same war to other parts of Europe, in particular, the Baltic countries, Poland, and Moldova. The whole of Europe is placed in the conditions of a severe price crisis, when through the manipulation of the energy market Russia achieves unprecedented pressure on the standard of living of the absolute majority of Europeans. And all of us are on the brink of a nuclear disaster due to the capture of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant by Russian troops. These are terrible conditions. But we are all together, we defend ourselves vigorously, we have not abandoned our task. We have established and should only increase our cooperation in the security and defense areas. Increase the supply of weapons and ammunition to defend against the Russian pressure. Increase the manufacture of weapons and ammunition in Europe to be always ready to defend our common space. Indeed, I understand, and all of us would rather spend the money we spend on armaments on completely different goals – peaceful goals, social needs. But who and what will be able to protect such goals and such needs? We have to be especially careful about the protection of our critical infrastructure – and especially after the sabotage that happened at gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea. Never before has our continent faced such a threat – the threat of destroying underwater pipelines, cables, and tunnels. But now you can expect this from Russia. At the same time, we must strengthen our cooperation to help each other, provide all Europeans with adequate energy guarantees. Russia must not succeed in its effort to force Europeans into energy poverty or even a complete lack of energy. The key challenge is in Ukraine. The first is the physical protection of energy facilities from Russian strikes. We need enough air defense systems to prevent Russia from leaving people without heat and electricity in the winter. The second is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. We must finally force Russia to immediately comply with the demands of the IAEA and all normal people of the world and demilitarize the plant. And this is not only about Russian military equipment, but also about the removal of all troops from the plants. Right now there are 500 Russian terrorists at the Zaporizhzhia plant. And there is no place for them there! This is essential for nuclear safety. This is absolutely essential for Ukraine to have the necessary volume of electricity for export. For export, which is fundamentally important for our neighbors in the EU this winter. The third is reconstruction. Fast restoration of facilities destroyed by Russia during hostilities. I am grateful to those countries that have already started working under our Fast Recovery Plan. And we expect a substantive discussion on this during the Conference in Germany on October 25. We have already created and must constantly strengthen the system of sanction pressure on the aggressor. I thank you very much for the adoption of the eighth package of EU sanctions, which includes, in particular, Russian oil. We must continue moving in this direction – the direction of pressure on the Russian energy sector, on this main source of income of the aggressor state. And we must maintain political leadership. This is especially important right now – when Russian forces have finally arrived on the battlefield, and our heroes are liberating Ukrainian land every day – village after village, city after city. To stop the liberation of Ukraine, Russia began to manipulate the topic of negotiations, and allegedly mentioned the dialogue, which it rejected, starting this war against Ukraine and against all of you, against all of Europe. It is obvious that Russia does not want any real negotiations. Because if it wanted to, it would have responded to dozens of our proposals and efforts. Russia just wants to save time. Wants to regroup forces. And accumulate resources. To strike again. We have to stop it from doing that. Like everything else in Europe, security is not something you can get by giving up something or signing a treaty. Security is a task. The task of expelling the occupier from the territory occupied by it. The task of holding murderers and executioners to account. The task of restoring the validity of the fundamental standards and conventions approved by the international community for all states without exception. We must be strong – until our common victory to preserve all that we value so much. We must never stop defending freedom and democracy so that our children and grandchildren can enjoy at least the same amount of rights and freedoms that we have. And we must invest now in our defense, in our security, in our cooperation as much as possible, so that anyone in the world, who might even have a thought to start an anti-European path, will forever be aware that the strength of European unity is insuperable. I thank you for your attention! I thank you for your support! Long live united Europe! United also as a task. A task for us and you. Equal leaders of European countries – countries of the European Union. All de facto, but not all de jure yet. And this is also a task for you and me – a task for the sake of our Europe. The space of freedom, democracy, social development and fundamental values that unite us all. Thank you! Thank you, Charles! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! An important decision was made today. It's fair. Legally perfect. Historical. Ukraine confirmed its respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Japan, including its Northern territories, which are still under Russian occupation. Today, I signed the relevant decree. There is a corresponding statement of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. And we call on everyone in the world to make similar decisions. Russia has no right to these territories. Everyone in the world knows this well. And we must finally act. We must de-occupy all the lands that the Russian occupiers are trying to keep for themselves. Only in this way can we return the full force to international law. The UN Charter and the entire complex of treaties and conventions on which the international legal order is based will work only when the occupiers lose and the nations in the world are protected from any occupations. With this war against Ukraine, against the international legal order, against our people, Russia has put itself in conditions – and it is now only a matter of time – of the real liberation of everything that once was seized and is now under the control of the Kremlin. Russia, by its example, will show all potential aggressors of the world that an aggressive terrorist war in our time is a way to weaken and inevitably destroy the one who starts such a war. The aggressor must lose. So be it. So that such wars do not happen again and that the peace is really long-term. Nothing should be left for the invaders. I believe: justice will be restored for our partners as well. This week alone, our soldiers liberated 776 square kilometers of territory in the east of our country and 29 settlements, including six in Luhansk region, from the Russian pseudo-referendum. In total, 2,434 square kilometers of our land and 96 settlements have already been liberated since the beginning of this offensive operation. And today I want to mention the fighters of the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, the 80th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade and the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade and note their heroic efforts to liberate Ukrainian land. There are also good results in the south of Ukraine this week – we are liberating our land and our people there from the pseudo-referendum every day. We will certainly come to the lands that were occupied by Russia earlier. I'm thankful to all our defenders who ensure this! During these 225 days, 29,887 Ukrainian soldiers were awarded state awards. A total of 178 soldiers were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Such a scale of courage and heroism of our fighters unequivocally proves that Ukraine cannot be stopped. And each of the Russian attacks, all manifestations of Russian terror – against Zaporizhzhia, against Kharkiv, against Mykolaiv, against Donbas and all our other territories – only prove that the liberation of our entire land is the only foundation of peace and security for all Ukrainians. Today, I took part in the meeting of the European Council. I thanked our partners for the eighth package of sanctions against Russia and for all the support for Ukraine that is already provided. We are working together to increase our common capabilities – of everyone in Europe. Preparations have already begun for important events planned for next week, both in Ukraine and at the international level. It will be a strong week for our state, it will be a strong week for our defense. Eternal glory to all those who fight and work for peace for Ukraine! Eternal glory to our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear friends! Mr. Presidents! Thank you for this opportunity to address the members and guests of your security forum. Security is a key issue of our time. And, without exaggeration, everything depends on what answer we offer now. Not only our state institutions, our sovereignty, borders, and political system depend on it. It is literally about life. About peace for all of us. For the first time in many decades, we found ourselves in such conditions when we have to defend the right to life for our nations. Not just one or another living conditions, not just one or another concept for life in Europe or in certain regions, but life itself. Russia's war against Ukraine is only a harbinger of what can await any state on our continent or in other parts of the world that this aggressor can reach. And I am grateful to everyone who understands the meaning of Russian aggression and helps us - us as ourselves. So, analyzing the elements of the Russian war against our state and the specific steps of the aggressor, we can draw conclusions about what forms and methods of protection we need for the sake of security. The first is unity. This is the foundation. This is something that should always be not only formally, but also in essence. Not only at summits, but also in deeds. Not only with those with whom you are used to cooperating, but with everyone whose values are common and whose way of life is freedom. Russia is afraid of our unity. So it goes to great lengths to break it. But we are only strengthening our unity. And therefore, we cannot be conquered by Russia. Neither Ukraine, nor Montenegro, nor any other state of the free world. Where real unity is achieved, there will be peace. Just as it will be in Ukraine. The second is democracy. This is our character. We can see that the current leaders of Russia have an obsessive desire to break the principle of democratic change of power in all countries regarding which they have aggressive ambitions. They do not recognize the results of elections and people’s movements when they lose influence because of them. And they try to stage coups or corrupt the political process when they choose a puppet to represent their interests. We have to strictly oppose this. All European states must dismantle any Russian networks of influence. So that there is no spread of misinformation, corruption and criminal politics. It is no less important for the Balkans than for our part of Europe. The third is independence. We should recognize the obvious at all levels in Europe and the world: Russia is not a threat to one, but to everyone. Therefore, everyone must achieve complete independence from Russia, so that it cannot turn dependence on it into shackles: economic dependence, energy dependence, political dependence - any. The fourth is weapons. It sounds a little unusual in Europe, but now we see what kind of war Russia can make literally out of nothing. Russia can block the sea for a country it wants to capture. It can burn cities and villages. It can arrange missile terror. Look at the intensity of the war we are now waging for our defense. Take a look - and you will be able to estimate the amount of weapons that may be needed for defense in such a war, if Russia turns the territory of another country into a battlefield. No matter how difficult it may be, we must ensure for Ukraine now, so that we can restore peace to all its citizens, and for Europe after this war such a volume of weapons, such a power of weapons, that Russia will never again have the desire to destroy peace. And the fifth point is responsibility. For many years, the head of Russia and his entourage have felt complete impunity. They destroyed democracy in their country. And they began to destroy everything around Russia. They are used to stealing what they like and buying those who were supposed to protect the national interests of this or that state from them. They started a war against Ukraine in 2014 because they felt that they would not be punished for it. The war against Georgia showed them this. They carried out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, because they do not believe that the world will be able to hold them accountable not just for the crime of aggression against a sovereign state, but for any crime imaginable. So to bring them to justice is to guarantee long-term peace after this war. The inevitability of punishment is one of the key principles of criminal justice. And we must apply this principle to the Russian leadership as they deserve it. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear friends! We must strengthen our alliances and cooperation. We must get rid of all kinds of dependence on Russia. We must ensure that we have sufficient weapons and effectiveness to provide full protection in the air, on land, at sea, and in cyberspace – in this war that Russia is already waging against Ukraine, and in any new war if Russia wants to expand hostilities now or to repeat the aggression in the future. By the way, all this is taken into account in our proposals for updating the security architecture of Ukraine and Europe, which we presented. And I ask all of you to familiarize yourself with the draft Kyiv Security Compact, which can become a fundamental prerequisite for peace in Eastern Europe. And, finally, punishment for aggression. Sanctions against Russia are mandatory. They should not just act, but regularly be intensified so that the aggressor state does not have time to adapt. I am grateful to everyone who supports such a policy! And I am grateful to everyone who works together with us to ensure that every Russian murderer and torturer receives a legal punishment I have no doubts about the victory of Ukraine. We can restore peace and freedom to the entire Ukrainian territory. The successes of our warriors on the frontline prove this. But I want to be able to say that I do not doubt the complete security of Europe and each of our nations after this war. This is also possible. We know the right answers to the key question of our time, and therefore there will be peace. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Today was a good and mostly sunny day on the territory of our state. It was about 20 degrees and sunny in large parts of the country. Unfortunately, it was cloudy in Crimea. Although it is also warm. But no matter what the clouds are, Ukrainians know what to do. And they know that our future is sunny. This is a future without occupiers. Throughout our territory, in particular in Crimea. If the occupiers flee while they have a chance, this will be the best option for them. If they are forced to stay, any occupier can find a way to surrender to Ukrainian captivity. We guarantee the preservation of lives to all Russian military servicemen who voluntarily lay down their arms and surrender. Ukraine always adheres to all international norms and conventions. We will not leave any other options for the occupiers to rely on. And again and again I want to thank all our citizens who are fighting and working for peace for Ukraine, for the liberation of our entire land. This day, the movement of our military, the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Guard and all those who take part in active actions – actions in the east, actions in the south of our country – continued. We are holding positions in Donbas, in particular in the Bakhmut direction, where now it is very, very hard, very tough fighting. Today, I would like to once again mention our soldiers from the Kholodny Yar 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade for their courage and sustained power in this direction. Thanks to all our anti-aircraft gunners and everyone involved in the air defense of Ukraine. We are doing everything we can to defend Ukrainian skies, and it is one of the highest priorities for our diplomats to speed up the decision of our partners to provide Ukraine with modern and effective anti-aircraft systems in sufficient quantity. We will definitely come to that. In the de-occupied territories, we do not slow down the pace of reconstruction work for a single day. It's transport, it's electricity, it's gas supply, it's postal services, social benefits – wherever there is a real possibility to provide it, we provide it. I must ask all Ukrainians in the territory where the occupiers were to be especially attentive to the mine threat. Our explosive ordnance disposal teams, our bomb disposal engineers are working at their maximum, but after the occupiers, a very large area is contaminated with mines. Please do not ignore mine warnings, do not visit areas closed due to danger, please report any mines or unexploded ordnance found to the police, emergency services or local authorities. And I want to add one more thing. Lawyer's Day is celebrated in Ukraine today. Not everyone who has a law degree works in law. But among those who still work in this field, there are people whose contribution is truly historic. Very important. Those who investigate into the crimes of the occupiers. Those who help to restore justice, in particular by working in the field of human rights. Those who do everything so that every Russian murderer and the aggressor state itself are inevitably punished for this war. I thank all of you for this very important work! I'm thankful to investigators, prosecutors, human rights defenders, lawyers, civil servants, and employees of public organizations. I'm thankful to everyone who teaches law, fights for the rule of law and helps people defend their rights, freedoms and legitimate interests. Justice for Ukraine, for Europe, for the world must and will be restored. Thanks to our indomitable, strong, conscientious and educated people. Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Today I want to address those in the world who give in to Russian manipulations about the alleged negotiations. About an assumption that it is supposedly only negotiations that can end this brutal Russian terrorist war. Does the terrorist state want peace? Obviously not. It proves that every day and every night. Zaporizhzhia. One of the Ukrainian cities against which Russia directs its missile terror. At least 14 people died last night as a result of Russian strikes on ordinary residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia. Unfortunately, this number may increase. Debris is still being cleared. More than 70 people were injured, including 11 children. All of them are provided with proper aid. Hundreds of families were left homeless. An entire block, from the first to the sixth floor, was destroyed by one of the missiles - a heavy anti-ship missile Kh-22 - aimed at an ordinary nine-story residential building. It was a deliberate strike. The one who gave the order and those who carried it out knew what they were targeting. The strikes this night continued a series of Russian missile strikes on Zaporizhzhia, which have killed at least 43 people since October 3 this week alone. And there were also strikes on Kharkiv, on the cities of Donbas, on other cities of Ukraine... There were also strikes by Iranian drones. Airstrikes. The absolute majority of them were aimed at the civil infrastructure of Ukraine and civilians. When someone wants to negotiate, he does not do so. And when someone is a terrorist, that’s exactly what he does. Do negotiations really help overcome terror? Now everyone has to answer this question honestly. Terrorists are neutralized. Terrorism is a crime that must be punished. Terrorism at the state level is one of the most heinous international crimes, which threatens not just someone in the world, but the entire international community. If terror goes unpunished, if the terrorist succeeds in intimidation so much that someone in the world is willing to simply turn a blind eye to terror, then that will be a loss - a loss of freedom, a loss of humanity and a loss of democracy. This is exactly what Russia longs for. This is why it needs all this terror - from missile strikes to global crises provoked by a terrorist state. This has already happened in history. Last time another terrorist state was allowed to do what it wanted because the world powers were afraid of its terror, World War II started. Now the world is united. Now everyone in the world understands what this war in Ukraine is actually being waged against by Russia. This is a Russian war against all those values that make people human and life peaceful. Ukraine will win this war. We can liberate our entire land and we can put the terrorist state in place. Russia must be punished for terror. Only this guarantees that the confrontation will not grow to an even greater scale and will not spread to other countries. But for this we must preserve the maximum unity - the unity of all the people of the world who value peace, respect the right to life for everyone and are honest enough to admit: the constant terror against the civilian population is an obvious Russian refusal to engage in real negotiations. Therefore, official designation of Russia as a terrorist state is needed - designation at all levels. It is necessary to limit any economic contacts with any Russian subjects - you cannot be a sponsor of terrorism. We need a clear condemnation at all levels of every escalating step by Russia - from terrorist attacks to the criminal attempt to annex our territory. The relevant resolution will be considered by the UN General Assembly in a few days. We will see from the vote who and how treat terrorists in reality. And Ukraine needs principled and sufficient aid. Aid to our people who are targeted by the terrorist state. It is necessary to accelerate the provision of a sufficient number of effective air defense systems to Ukraine. The negotiations on the provision of such air defense systems, the negotiations on increasing other defense, political and financial support for Ukraine are the only possible negotiation format that can really bring peace closer. I am grateful to everyone who helps us resist terror!  I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for the return of peace to Ukraine and guarantees of the right to life and security to every Ukrainian. Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror! Glory to Ukraine!"

Kyiv region and Khmelnytskyi region, Lviv and Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Ivano-Frankivsk region, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy region, Kharkiv region, Zhytomyr region, Kirovohrad region, the south of the country. They want panic and chaos, they want to destroy our energy system. They are incorrigible. The second target is people. Such a time and such goals were specially chosen to cause as much damage as possible. But. We are Ukrainians. We help each other. We believe in ourselves. We restore everything destroyed. There may be temporary power outages now, but there will never be an outage of our confidence - our confidence in victory. Why such strikes exactly? The enemy wants us to be afraid, wants to make people run. But we can only run forward - and we demonstrate this on the battlefield. It will continue to be so. Rescuers are working now. Our air defense system is working. 38 aerial targets have already been shot down. Please stay in shelters today. Thanks to the help of our military, everything will be fine. Always follow the safety rules. And always remember: Ukraine existed before this enemy appeared, and Ukraine will exist after it. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Fellow Ukrainians! Another day of our defense. A difficult day. Restoration work is currently underway across the country. We will restore all objects that were damaged by today's attack by Russian terrorists. It's only a matter of time. I tasked all structures of our state to ensure recovery as fast as possible. In some cities and regions, where there were blackouts due to shelling, the electricity supply has already been restored. As of now: Kharkiv region - 50% of energy supply has been restored. Energy crews need several hours to restore electricity supply to the majority of districts. Poltava region - restored almost everywhere. Mykolaiv region, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa region - connected. Cherkasy - connected. Khmelnytskyi - there is light in most parts of the city. In some cities and districts, efforts are still needed to give people electricity. Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Kyiv and Kyiv region, Lviv region, Ternopil region, Dnipropetrovsk region - we are working. Somewhere it takes hours, somewhere you have to wait a little longer, but the result will be everywhere. Unfortunately, 12 people died today in this terrorist attack. More than 80 were wounded or injured. Everyone who applied for help gets it. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine and all those involved in the defense of our state also perform their tasks. Of the 84 Russian missiles launched against Ukraine, 43 were shot down. Out of 24 Russian drones, 13 were shot down. And even after that, every ten minutes I get a message about the downing of Iranian \"Shaheds\". Only in the last hours... 16:28 – \"Shahed\" was destroyed, Litky district. 17:26 – Kremenchuk, \"Shahed\" was destroyed. 17:36 – Cherkasy, \"Shahed\" was destroyed. 17:40 – Dovhyntseve, Kryvyi Rih, \"Shahed\" was destroyed. 17:50 – Apostolove, \"Shahed\" was destroyed. And it’s like that all day long. Now as I speak I continue to receive such messages. Therefore, please follow the safety rules and pay attention to the air alarm. The danger is still there. But we are fighting.  I am grateful to our Air Forces and Ground Forces units that were involved today! The leaders of the terrorists say that they hit all the targets they planned. First, they lie, as usual. Secondly, they lie, as usual. Take a look at their real targets, apart from energy facilities. Look at just one example of our capital... The crossroads in Kyiv where I stand. The crossroads of Volodymyrska Street and Shevchenko Boulevard. That's the target. Seven hundred meters from here is the bell tower of St. Sophia’s Cathedral. Moscow did not yet exist when it was already standing. A little further there is Volodymyr’s Hill, a place that became the source of Christianity and culture for Eastern Europe. In particular, for the territory that much later came to be called Russia. Next to me are the buildings of the Shevchenko University, which will soon celebrate its 190th anniversary. They are damaged now by this Russian strike. But we will restore everything. The Teacher's House was also damaged today. At one time, the Central Council of Ukraine worked there, and for Ukrainians this place will always be a place of memory about our glorious history of statehood. And right behind me there is a playground in Shevchenko Park, which also became a target for a Russian missile. But it is not just in Shevchenko Park. It is on one of the main museum streets of Kyiv. In particular, the Khanenko Art Museum was damaged by this attack by terrorists. And it’s like this in all the cities of our state - civil, cultural, educational facilities. Who can fight all this? Who can rejoice at strikes on such objects and such land? They say they want to push Ukraine back into the XVIII century. But they pushed themselves back into a much older era, in the era of savages, which they became quite consciously. And Ukraine will still remain in the XXI century. Kyiv saw various strangers. And survived them all. Kyiv will also survive this onslaught of terrorists who have no history, no tradition, no culture. They are temporary. And even if they live for 70 years, they still don't have enough time to understand anything. Ukraine cannot be intimidated. We united even more instead. Ukraine cannot be stopped. We are convinced even more that terrorists must be neutralized.  The Russian army carried out these strikes during the morning rush hour on purpose. This is a typical terrorist tactic. They wanted to incite more fear and affect more people. They affected. They affected the whole world. Today I have already spoken with the Chancellor of Germany, the President of France, the Emir of Qatar, the President of Poland, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I had a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador. Now I have conversations scheduled with the Prime Minister of Canada and the President of the United States. Tomorrow - with the Prime Minister of Italy. I am grateful to all for the unambiguous support! We’re consolidating the world. And I feel that the world is with us. An extraordinary meeting of the G7 is already scheduled for tomorrow. We are working on a resolution for the UN General Assembly to condemn Russia for all its escalating steps, for its terror. Terror inevitably receives a global response. And the blatant nature of Russian terror only encourages everyone to be more determined. Regarding energy. We will do everything to restore normal production and supply of electricity. We need electricity to be supplied for all families, regardless of any manifestations of Russian terror. We need energy to be supplied to all our homes, in all regions. Therefore, we need a reasonable consumption of electricity now. There are hours of peak load on the power system - from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. I am asking you, please, at this time, consume electricity in such a way as not to overload the power system. Please postpone washing, ironing, repairing and using other electrical appliances that consume a lot of energy before 5 p.m. or after 10 p.m. A strong request. The more Ukrainians consume electricity in this way, the more stable our energy system will be. We are doing everything to get modern air defense systems. And I am grateful to the partners who are already speeding up the delivery. We are doing everything to strengthen our Armed Forces. And now the occupiers already cannot oppose us on the battlefield, that is why they resort to this terror. Well, we’ll make the battlefield even more excruciating for the enemy. And we will restore everything that was destroyed. Please help each other! Please take care of those who are left alone in such circumstances! Believe in yourself, in Ukraine, in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and in our victory!  Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear colleagues, dear friends! Thank you Chancellor Scholz for convening this extraordinary G7 summit and thank you to all the countries that supported this initiative and to all the leaders who are here today. For the second day now, Ukraine has been suffering from massive Russian missile strikes. And for the 230th day – from the Russian terrorist war. Starting from yesterday, the enemy used more than a hundred cruise missiles and dozens of different drones, including Iranian \"Shaheds\". And every ten minutes I receive a message about the enemy's use of Iranian \"Shaheds\". As an example, here’s one hour of this morning: 5:01 – \"Shahed” was shot down over the Black Sea. 5:11 – one more down.  5:13 – one more. 5:28 – \"Shahed” again.  5:30 – one more \"Shahed”.  5:36, 5:49 – two more \"Shaheds”.  And it’s like that almost every hour! Plus 28 launches of Russian missiles today. And that's just this morning. And 84 missiles yesterday. We should all be aware that this is the enemy not only of Ukraine. It is the enemy of each of you. It is not limited to missiles. We see sabotage against gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea and against critical cables in Europe. We see an energy crisis. Food crisis and artificial threat of famine for African and Asian countries. And who does all that? Who provokes and incites that? A terrorist state. And this is Russia. Today it is so. Russia wants to provoke chaos in Ukraine and in the entire democratic world, and therefore uses everything - from missile strikes to the seizure of a nuclear plant, threats of a radiation disaster, from sabotage against infrastructure in Europe to a deliberate attempt to destroy Ukraine's energy facilities. Destroy all of them. We must stop all this. I thank you for all the help already provided. It is big, it is significant. But the Russian leader, who is now in the final stage of his reign, still has room for further escalation. This possibility of his is a threat to all of us. But we can overcome this threat. We have a formula for peace. And now, reacting to Russian terror, sham referenda and the attempt to annex our territory, we can apply the peace formula so that the terrorist state stands no chance. The first point is defense support. Air shield for Ukraine. This is part of the security guarantees that are an element of our peace formula. When Ukraine receives a sufficient number of modern and effective air defense systems, the key element of Russian terror - missile strikes - will cease to work. I thank Germany and Chancellor Scholz personally for speeding up the delivery of IRIS. I thank the USA and personally President Biden for the decision to provide modern missile defense and air defense systems. And we believe, Mr. President, that these will be medium and long-range systems that will allow us to create an echeloned defense system. I thank everyone who has already helped us secure our air defense system, which allows us to neutralize some of the Russian missiles and drones. But! According to our intelligence, Russia ordered 2,400 \"Shaheds\" alone from Iran. And that’s why, dear Mr. Chancellor, dear President of the United States, it is important that we have sufficient missiles for the air defense and anti-missile systems provided and that these systems are integrated with our defense system. Tomorrow in the format of Ramstein I would ask that our defense ministers discuss this. Mr. President of France! Mr. Prime Minister of Italy! We are very much looking forward to the delivery of the SAMP-T systems. And if possible, they are needed in the coming months. Dear friends! Mrs. Prime Minister Truss! Prime Minister Trudeau! Prime Minister Kishida! Dear President Charles Michel! Dear Ursula von der Leyen! I am asking you to strengthen the overall effort to help financially with the creation of an air shield for Ukraine. Millions of people will be grateful to the Group of Seven for such assistance. The second point is the territorial integrity of Ukraine. It is also an element of our peace formula. And it is logically combined with the third point - with punishment, which is an integral element of any peace formula. The one who started the armed aggression is an international criminal. He must be convicted. The protection of the territorial integrity of Ukraine is the protection of the entire international legal order, starting from the UN Charter. Various potential aggressors in the world are now watching the reaction of democracies to the farce arranged by Russia with sham referenda and attempted annexation. Russia must be completely isolated and punished. Punished both politically and in terms of sanctions. I thank our European friends for the eighth sanctions package. But look - the eighth package is not a punishment for Russia. Russia has started a new stage of escalation, and therefore a new sanctions package is needed - a strong package. And I ask you to develop it! We have to respond symmetrically at the level of the entire Group of Seven, our entire democratic world: when Russia attacks the energy sector and energy stability of our countries, we must block its energy sector with sanctions, break the stability of Russian revenues from oil and gas trade. A tough price cap is needed for the exports of oil and gas from Russia - zero profit for the terrorist state. Such steps can bring peace closer - they will encourage the terrorist state to think about peace, about the unprofitability of war. We must also recognize the obvious fact: there can be no dialogue with this leader of Russia, who has no future. He himself rejected the dialogue. Despite all our efforts to negotiate peace over the years! He speaks with ultimata, terror is his attitude to the world, to other people. After the Russian strikes, all the murders, all the abuse of civilians and international law, your societies will not understand you if you do not cut off any prospects for this leader of terror. All of us in the world should realize: talks can be either with another head of Russia - who will comply with the UN Charter, the basic principles of humanity and territorial integrity of Ukraine - or in a different configuration, so that the key terrorist does not have the opportunity to influence key decisions through terror. Now one person is blocking peace - and this person is in Moscow. Now, while we have no opportunity for diplomacy because this Russian leader only believes in terror, we need defense support. It is on the battlefield that peace is gained. But also in the sphere of diplomacy - in our work on security guarantees for Ukraine and supplementing the existing security architecture in Europe. The Kyiv Security Compact project is a real contribution to security, it is a visionary element of the peace formula for all of us. I am asking you to support this Compact! And one more thing. Peace is possible not only when there is peace with one neighbor, but when there is peace with all neighbors. And I want to draw attention to one country. The territory of Belarus is already used for strikes against Ukraine. And now we see a bigger threat. Russia is trying to directly draw Belarus into this war, playing a provocation that we are allegedly preparing an attack on this country. Indirectly it has already involved them. And now it wants to involve them directly. Ukraine did not plan and does not plan military actions against Belarus. We are only interested in restoring our territorial integrity. But in order to completely remove this provocation, to remove these narratives by Lukashenko, to remove even the assumption of any alleged threat from us, we offer our solution. A mission of international observers may be stationed on the border of Ukraine and Belarus to monitor the security situation. The format can be worked out by our diplomats. And I ask you at the level of the Group of Seven to support this initiative of ours. Dear colleagues! Now is the crucial time. This leader of Russia, feeling the approach of his end, is trying to force the democratic world to surrender with a terrorist rush. To retreat. To lose. This can only be the desire of an insane person - more than a hundred missile strikes in less than two days against civilians, against civilian infrastructure, sham referenda, a criminal attempt at annexation... Think about it - radiation blackmail! The terrorist must lose. He must constantly feel that there is responsibility for terror. Let's make it happen! I thank you for your help! I apologize for not having time to thank each country separately, each leader personally. But Ukraine knows how to be grateful, we will be grateful, we are grateful. We bring peace together! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear defenders of the educational, scientific and cultural heritage of mankind! Today, Ukraine is going through the 230th day of a full-scale war. How was your morning today? I will tell you what ours was like. At eight o'clock in the morning, most of the territory of Ukraine was already in a state of air alert. Russia launched cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. Today, children in Ukraine didn’t go to kindergartens, schools, or universities again. Online learning is introduced everywhere. In this war, we cannot know who and what will be targeted by Russian missiles. Children or adults... An educational facility or a cultural object... A critical infrastructure facility or, for example, a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. All of these are equal targets for Russia. This night, a Russian missile hit the premises of the Khortytsia Academy in the Zaporizhzhia region. For what? This is their tactic. The tactic of terrorists. More than 2,600 educational facilities have already been destroyed or damaged by such terrorist attacks by Russia. Yesterday in Kyiv, our capital, a Russian missile hit the crossroads in the central part of the city. People died - literally burned in cars. And it was 700 meters from the bell tower of St. Sophia’s Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. At the same crossroads are the buildings of Shevchenko University, one of the most important universities in Eastern Europe. It was affected by this strike. The Institute of Philology is damaged. Russia can award itself the special title of winner of universities, institutes, academies and schools. How many cruise missiles do educational institutions have? Zero. And Russia has hundreds of missiles. This is what its victory is like. Another Russian missile hit Tereshchenkivska Street in Kyiv yesterday. The premises of the Khanenko Museum were damaged, masterpieces by Velázquez, Canova, and Cellini are stored there. The premises of the Shevchenko Museum. One of the most renowned Kyiv publishing houses. Can you imagine a missile attack on Babyn Yar in Kyiv, the burial place of a hundred thousand victims of Nazi executions? And this strike took place. Can you imagine the shelling of the Menorah in Drobytsky Yar, Kharkiv region, where 20,000 Nazi victims are buried? And this shelling also took place. 540 is the total number of objects of cultural heritage, cultural institutions and religious buildings damaged by Russian strikes in Ukraine during the full-scale war since February 24. Almost 200 destroyed or damaged temples! And it is possible - while I am addressing you now - that one of the Russian strikes damaged other cultural or educational objects, other memorials or temples. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear defenders of the educational, scientific and cultural heritage of mankind! Please tell me why the representatives of Russia are still among you? What are they doing at UNESCO? How can there be representatives of a terrorist state in UNESCO, which is proud of the destruction it causes in another country? I am grateful to UNESCO for supporting Ukraine at this time and for all the principled statements that were made to protect Ukraine and culture from Russian aggression. But still, new steps are needed - steps that Russia will feel. A terrorist state definitely has no right to chair one of the key bodies for the protection of cultural and natural heritage - the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. Such a Russian presidency devalues the institution itself - its significance, its reputation. It is inadmissible to let Russia destroy the authority of UNESCO. The terrorist state must be excluded from all UNESCO bodies and from the Organization itself. Let it be a historical example for everyone in the world that no one will tolerate an enemy of culture, an enemy of history, an enemy of education, an enemy of science. Unfortunately, this is Russia's choice - to oppose everything that matters to humanity. This is its deliberate choice. The second thing that is needed now is the expansion of our joint efforts to protect cultural heritage in Ukraine. Just now! Given daily threats of Russian strikes. We must provide a clear signal that the world will not turn a blind eye to the destruction of our common history, our common culture, our common heritage. One of the steps for this should be the preservation of the historical center of Odesa - a beautiful city, an important port of the Black Sea and a source of culture for millions of people in different countries. Together with our partners, we prepared the nomination file of Odesa for inclusion in the World Heritage List. We are passing this on to UNESCO. And I am asking you to initiate an extraordinary session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee to resolve this issue for Odesa. And please, it cannot be delayed, it cannot be postponed. Odesa, like all other cities of Ukraine, is a target for Russian strikes. Please support Odesa! Show at the level of UNESCO precisely that Russian terror must end. Colleagues! Ukraine has been a conscientious member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization since May 12, 1954. Our state always invests only in the preservation of our common heritage and never in destruction! Now we need your support. Support in the preservation and protection of education, science and culture. I would like to express my gratitude to UNESCO and its partners for their willingness to provide 50,000 computers for Ukrainian teachers to ensure online education. But we need more. We already offer partners - both at the state level, and at the level of international and non-governmental organizations, businesses - to join the reconstruction of Ukraine after hostilities. Some partners have joined. Now I am addressing those who have not yet decided to support Ukrainian recovery. This project will definitely become the largest economic and infrastructure project in Europe over the last 50 years. And this is a historic opportunity for each of you - to be participants in this project, to be historically significant defenders of education, culture and science - our joint heritage. I believe that our common strength will be enough so that terror can never win. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for this opportunity to address you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! The enemy launched a second wave of terrorist attacks against our country. As of this morning, there were 28 missiles, of which 20 were shot down. More than 15 drones, almost all of them are Iranian combat drones. Most were shot down. I am thankful to all our warriors of the Air Forces, Ground Forces and Intelligence involved in defense against these Russian strikes! And, by the way, at the request of the military command, I want to celebrate soldier Dmytro Shumskyi (anti-aircraft missile platoon of the 57th separate radio engineering battalion, Chernihiv direction) for yesterday. On October 10, Dmytro Shumskyi showed excellent skills and reaction and shot down two terrorists' cruise missiles with the help of Stinger MANPADS. One person saved dozens of lives. Thank you for that! Restoration works are taking place quite quickly and efficiently throughout the country. If it wasn't for today's strikes, we would have already restored the energy supply, water supply and communications that the terrorists damaged yesterday. And today, Russia will achieve only one additional thing: it will delay our recovery a little. Where there was destruction, the infrastructure will be renewed everywhere. Where there were losses, there is already or will be construction. Where there were any hopes of the enemy, there will be ruins of Russian statehood. And I thank everyone who, at their level, provides recovery after terrorist attacks. I am grateful to the rescuers - more than a thousand employees of the State Emergency Service, who immediately arrived on calls and began neutralizing the consequences of terrorist attacks. At the suggestion of the Minister of Internal Affairs, I would like to especially note the selfless and determined actions of senior ensign Borys Shapovalov, commander of the department in the Zaporizhzhia region; sergeant Oleksandr Smiyan, firefighter-rescuer, Zaporizhzhia region; ensign Yuriy Lozynskyi and junior sergeant Oleksiy Biletskyi, respirator workers of the mining and rescue department, Kyiv city. I am grateful to all the doctors who helped the wounded and injured! I am grateful to all energy workers and utility workers for their high-quality response and quick work. I am grateful to the local government workers, heads of local government and government officials who worked together, truly in unity and excellently. Now most of the cities and villages that the terrorists wanted to leave without electricity and communication are already with electricity and communication. In some cities and districts, work is still ongoing. In some cities and districts, energy workers apply temporary restrictions on energy supply according to the schedule - this is necessary solely in order to maintain the stability of the energy system. The government controls all this - we are trying to restore normal conditions as quickly as possible. I would also like to thank all Ukrainians who listened yesterday and limited their own electricity consumption during peak hours - from 17:00 to 22:00. Thanks to our conscientiousness, we managed to save a tenth of the energy on average in the country, which allowed the system to work more stably. And our goal should be to save a quarter of electricity precisely during these peak hours. It should be done today and in the near future. Please postpone the energy consumption of appliances that require a lot of electricity to other hours of the day. It is not difficult for an individual, and it gives a great result within the scale of our entire country. I took part today in the extraordinary summit of the Group of Seven, which was convened by the German presidency on our initiative. We discussed the response of the most powerful democracies to this new Russian escalation. For such a new wave of terror there must be a new wave of responsibility for Russia. New sanctions, new forms of political pressure and new forms of support for Ukraine. Tomorrow, the defense support for Ukraine will be discussed in the \"Ramstein\" format. I expect progress from our partners on the issue of air and anti-missile defense, agreements on new supplies of other weapons and ammunition we need. The terrorist state must be deprived of even the thought that any wave of terror can bring it anything. A separate task for intelligence is to establish all those involved in these missile attacks against Ukraine, in schemes with Iranian drones. The individual responsibility of terrorists should be the same as the responsibility of the terrorist state. We work for this. Today I had separate conversations with the Prime Minister of Italy and the Prime Minister of Australia. I heard absolutely clear support, absolutely clear condemnation of all manifestations of Russian aggression against Ukraine and international law. We also have a detailed statement from the Group of Seven, in particular, that all those responsible for terror against Ukraine will be brought to justice. Starting with the current political leadership of Russia and ending with everyone who serves these terrorist interests. Mankind and humanity are stronger than any terrorists. I am thankful to everyone who fights and works for our victory! And one more thing. Today, 32 of our warriors were freed from Russian captivity. We do everything for Ukraine - possible and impossible. Gratitude to everyone who worked for this result! Glory to our beautiful people! We will restore everything that was destroyed! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I’ve just taken part in the work of the second ministerial roundtable discussion of donor countries, the IMF and the World Bank, which help our country maintain financial stability. The key issue is covering our budget deficit and quickly rebuilding critical infrastructure, housing and social facilities that have been destroyed or damaged by the occupiers' strikes. We are talking about significant amounts - tens of billions of dollars for the budget and the Fast Recovery. But the potential of democratic countries is much greater than the existing needs. Therefore, we are consolidating the support of partners for the sake of Ukraine. We are creating a financial \"Ramstein\" - a systemic tool for constant support of our struggle for freedom. Another meeting took place today in the format of the defense \"Ramstein\". Quite productive. First of all, they discussed providing our country with anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems. The more audacious and cruel Russian terror becomes, the more obvious it is to the world that helping Ukraine to protect the sky is one of the most important humanitarian tasks for Europe of our time. I believe that we will cope with this task. And I am grateful to those of our partners who have already made a decision to strengthen such support for our state - support for effective defense in the air. By the way, today I want to celebrate the fighters of our Air Forces in the southern direction. Good results were achieved there, in particular, four Russian attack helicopters and more than ten Iranian-made attack drones were shot down. We had to defend our sky today in other directions as well. We have positive news from the defense \"Ramstein\" related to the additional strengthening of our army with modern artillery. I am grateful to the partners! Recovery after a two-day Russian missile attack continued across the country today. At that time, energy facilities were damaged in 12 regions and in the capital. As of now, the technical capability of electricity supply has been fully restored in most regions. In four regions, work is ongoing, repairs should be completed shortly. Our energy workers in some cities and districts have to use stabilization blackout schedules. This is necessary solely to maintain the normal operation of the entire energy system in such conditions - in conditions where electricity production has decreased. And I want to once again thank all our people who approached this situation consciously and make their very important contribution to guaranteeing the normal operation of Ukraine's energy system. It is worth continuing to distribute your electricity consumption by the hours of the day, in order to use as little as possible equipment that requires a significant amount of electricity during peak hours. Today I would also like to thank all the heads of regions, mayors of cities and heads of communities, who significantly reduced electricity consumption in the utilities sector. It is important! The situation remains tough in all areas bordering the frontline. Tonight, the occupiers shelled Nikopol of the Dnipropetrovsk region with Grad and artillery. Among the wounded is a child, a girl born in 2016. An extremely serious wound... In the morning, Russian terrorists shelled Avdiivka, Donetsk region. Central Market. The occupiers used Grad. As of now, 7 people were killed and 12 were wounded. Our intelligence, special services, law enforcement agencies are finding out all the details regarding these and other Russian strikes. No Russian terrorist will manage to remain unknown to justice - we will find out all the names and all the details. Ukraine will bring to justice every Russian murderer and torturer - from commanders to privates who carried out criminal orders. By the way, we will not forget about the propagandists of terror as well. All those who justify Russian terror and incite aggression, all those who call for murder and encourage torturing of our people will be held to account on an equal footing with murderers and torturers. The entire Russian terror machine must be neutralized. And it will be neutralized. Gratitude to everyone who brings our victory closer! Gratitude to everyone who helps Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear attendees, Dear friends! Thank you for such attention to Ukraine! These days, our state has become the target of another blatant terrorist attack by Russia. More than a hundred Russian cruise missiles and fifty combat drones in less than two days against our civilian infrastructure and energy facilities. And that's just one attack. An attack that purposefully affected or damaged about a third of the Ukrainian energy industry. But the full-scale war against our country has been ongoing for more than 230 days, and the man who appropriated Russia is not going to end this war. He will spend tens and tens of billions of dollars more and approve many more attacks until we force Russia to make peace - with or without him. Our cooperation brings this moment closer - brings the victory of Ukraine closer. The more help Ukraine receives now, the faster the Russian war will end and the more reliably we will guarantee that such a cruel war will never spread to other countries again. I really appreciate that you all understand this! Thanks for all the support! I am thankful to the United States of America, President Biden, Congress for their special support. 8.5 billion dollars are aimed at fulfilling our social obligations - payment of salaries, pensions, support of the social sphere of Ukraine. I am thankful to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for their leadership at the institutional level in the implementation of aid programs for Ukraine. I am thankful to the European Union and all our partners who contributed to the stabilization of Ukraine's financial situation. You all see that Ukraine is strong enough to endure this war. However, it is necessary to maintain consistency in the support of our state and develop the existing lines of aid. Each specific step in support of Ukraine is a real reduction of Russian aggression. I want to offer you three more such steps now. First, I believe that it would be useful to create a coordination format for financial support of Ukraine similar to the one created in Ramstein for defense support. Mrs. Kristalina Georgieva and I discussed the importance of donor coordination. We should create a permanent working group that would deal with the financial support of Ukraine and work efficiently at different levels - at the level of international donors and at the level of countries participating in aid. The second is to reliably cover the deficit and ensure the basics of people's lives. We see that Russian terrorist attacks may be intensified. Therefore, we must symmetrically intensify cooperation for assistance - both for the restoration of the destroyed and for guaranteeing the financial stability of our state. You know the data - this year, Russian terror led to the decline of the Ukrainian economy by more than a third. Similarly, the real income of our people decreased by a third. Thousands of enterprises and infrastructure facilities were destroyed. Millions of people became internally displaced. As of now, we have two key state financial needs. This is 38 billion dollars to cover the state budget deficit next year. These are the salaries of teachers, doctors, social benefits, and pensions. This is a guarantee of life for the Ukrainian people. Another 17 billion dollars, which are verified by the World Bank and are needed for the reconstruction of critical infrastructure within the RDNA. These are schools, hospitals, critical transport and energy infrastructure, as well as damaged housing. In fact, everything that has become a primary target for Russia. We need targeted loans of 2 billion dollars to rebuild the electricity infrastructure after the destruction and to expand exports to Europe. Also, taking into account the crisis situation created by Russia on the entire continent, we need credit limits for the purchase of gas and coal for the next heating season. The volume of this level of support is at least 5 billion dollars. We might not have to use these limits, but they should be there to ensure stability. In this context of countering the deficit and guaranteeing stability, the new program of cooperation with the International Monetary Fund is critically important. The realistic volume is up to 20 billion dollars. We must finally approve such a program as the main source of covering the deficit. And the third thing I would like to offer you today is concrete investment support tools for Ukraine. In order to activate the economy and for businesses to start investing in Ukraine now, a military risk insurance mechanism for new investment projects is needed. I hope we can launch this mechanism together with the World Bank. Another element of protection of economic activity can be the opening by partner countries of the limits of export-import agencies for the supply of equipment to Ukraine. This is what can strengthen your companies right now - in cooperation with us. Ladies and Gentlemen! Right now, when the terrorist state is trying to intimidate us all even more, we must respond to Russian terror with even stronger and meaningful cooperation. This is real protection. Our common protection - of our common democracy, our way of life. Terror must lose. Ukraine must win. This is absolutely real - with your support. Again, I am grateful to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you so much for your support and for such profound words. Very clear, important words, actions, messages from you! Dear Mr. President! Dear Mrs. Secretary General! Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, attendees! Dear Europeans! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today. These days, Ukraine wakes up every morning with two questions: what else became the target of Russian terror overnight and where else did our forces manage to defeat these terrorists? And when I say “these days”, I don't mean two days or a week, or even a month. The Russian terrorist war against Ukraine has been ongoing for 232 days - after 8 years of war in Donbas. I think you are well informed about what Ukrainians have to go through these days. There is no shortage of information in the European media about specific manifestations of Russian terror, about the specific course of this war. The Ukrainian delegation to PACE also works quite effectively, emphasizing what is important for Ukraine and the whole of Europe. So, I will not waste time telling you about new targets of Russian terrorists and events on the frontline. I want to focus on something else - on how and when we will be able to put an end to \"these days\". When the war will end. When peace will come. When our territorial integrity and peace on the entire Ukrainian land will be restored. I remember when I became President of Ukraine in 2019, our state was experiencing pretty complicated relations with the Council of Europe. Then the Russian delegation returned to the PACE hall. In fact, there was an attempt to write off everything that Russia did against Ukraine and European values, starting in 2014. Write off under the guise of stories that it was necessary to maintain dialogue with Russia at all possible levels. Then the word \"dialogue\" masked the desire to turn a blind eye to reality. And even worse, this word masked the desire of some subjects to join the corrupt flow of money from Russia to Europe, which caused a lot of trouble in European politics. There is nothing like this this year. And I am grateful to you for that. Sincerely grateful. When Russia launched a full-scale invasion, you quickly made a principled decision and expelled the aggressor state from the Council of Europe. You also adopted resolutions condemning Russian terror and the crimes of this state against international law. Principles reign at all other levels of European institutions as well. But what does all this actually mean? This is evidence that a real dialogue has finally begun. An honest dialogue. A needed dialogue. And it's not just the word \"dialogue\" that masks something. It is the real search for solutions. A dialogue between Europeans. A dialogue about how to save people's lives and how to protect our values. About how Europe can withstand when everything that is fundamental to peace is attacked and when this attack is carried out not by some marginal political group, which has already happened in Europe, but by the geographically largest state in the world. The state that has been preparing for war for decades and turned the destruction of human rights into its ideology. And we see the historically important results of this dialogue in Europe - between Europeans. We see actions that have strengthened Europe in an unprecedented way. Never in history has a united Europe been as strong as it is now. Focused on everything necessary to prevent Russian terrorists from ruining our lives. This is the power of dialogue. We isolate Russia together. Together we punish terror and make it feel the price for the war it unleashed. Thanks to our dialogue, we have significant defense and financial support programs for Ukraine. And support programs for Ukrainians - those who left their homeland to escape hostilities. Thanks to our dialogue, a lot has been done to protect Europe from Russian energy weapons. What has been called for for decades has become a priority for both national governments and European institutions. And we should continue this kind of dialogue. Dialogue between us. Dialogue with our partners in the world. I ask you at all levels - in politics, in the media, in communication with voters - to defend the provision of Ukraine with a sufficient number of modern anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems. Already this year, we need to protect our sky from the terror of Russia. If this is done, it will be a fundamental step to end the entire war in the near future. We must continue our dialogue to further reduce Russia's ability to finance the war. In particular, it is vitally necessary to deprive the aggressor state of profits from the export of oil and gas. Russia must see zero in the accounts to start thinking about the benefits of peace. This should be the purpose of EU sanctions packages. We must continue our dialogue in order to finally find a way to force Russia to comply with the demand of the IAEA and without exaggeration all of humanity - to ensure the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russia must not only withdraw military equipment from there, but also take away all its militants. We must continue our dialogue in order to hold Russia as the aggressor state and each of the Russian murderers and torturers to account for all crimes in this war, for every manifestation of terror. When these legal mechanisms are established and operational, it will be one of the most powerful guarantees of long-term peace. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Europeans! This year we saw that Russia deliberately rejects any real dialogue with us. Russia wants to speak the language of terror only. And that's a fact. This fact must be recognized at all levels: politically, legally and on the battlefield in Ukraine - by supporting our defense capabilities. And I am grateful for the fact that the PACE can become the first international organization that designates Russia exactly this way - as a terrorist state. But we also saw the power of a real dialogue between us. Dialogue on how to stop terror. As a result, Europe is much stronger than anyone thought. And potentially, our ability to protect freedom, the rule of law, human rights and social justice is even stronger than we think about ourselves even now. Europe can play a historic role in the creation of the Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Let's do it! This will be the best way to protect the principles of international law. Europe can take the lead in the efforts to compensate for the damage caused by this war. We have to create an appropriate compensation mechanism - and we suggest the way to create it. The corresponding project has already been prepared by Ukraine. I urge you to support it - both in Europe and at the level of the UN General Assembly. All the more so since it is in Europe that the lion's share of Russian assets is concentrated - both of the state itself, and of corrupt officials and corrupt businesses associated with the aggressor state. Russian assets should be directed to compensation for war losses. If you put your hand on your heart, each and every one of you knows perfectly well what elements should be in the formula of peace. All of you hear what the dialogue is about in Ukraine, in Europe, in the world to end this war and restore peace. Ukraine offered its way to peace. This is the European way. The way of dialogue and principles. The way of implementation of the agreed decisions for the protection of Ukraine and humanity and constant increase of the price of the war for the aggressor. The way of bringing the perpetrators of the war to justice and compensation for damages. This is the way to victory. It is much shorter than it seems. But only on the condition that the dialogue for its sake is honest, between all those who really value freedom, and that the word \"dialogue\" does not mask the desire to turn a blind eye to war. I thank you for your attention! I thank you for your great support! Long live Europe! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I took part in the work of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe - outlined the most important things for us in achieving peace and restoring Ukraine and the international legal order after this war. We also have a powerful response from PACE, which is the first international organization to designate the current regime in Russia as terrorist. It is very important that this is a political signal. A signal to all states - members of the Council of Europe and all states of the world, that there is nothing to talk about with this terrorist group, which appropriated Russia and unleashed the most heinous war in Europe in 80 years. Terror must be responded with force at all levels: on the battlefield, with sanctions, and legally. We will create a special tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine and ensure the operation of a special compensation mechanism so that Russia will bear responsibility for this war at the cost of its assets. I am grateful to all our partners in the Council of Europe who work for justice for Ukraine and our entire continent. I am grateful to our PACE delegation for truly effective work! I am also grateful to all Ukrainian diplomats and our friends in the world and in the United Nations who helped consolidate the world community of states in such a way that we gained the highest support at the UN General Assembly for the entire time of the Russian terrorist war. The world sees what is happening. It knows the price of the farce that Russia staged in the occupied territory under the guise of sham referenda. 143 UN member states supported the resolution, which protects the basic principles of the UN Charter and condemns Russia for the criminal attempt to annex our territory. This is a record number of states supporting Ukraine today. But I believe that there will be more. Four states came out on the side of Russia - this is very eloquent. North Korea, Nicaragua, Belarus and Syria. Such a list that everything is clear. I am grateful to each of the 143 states! Today, an important meeting of our team, which deals with the issue of the release of prisoners, took place in the online format with representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and other international organizations related to this process. Very important things were said. In particular, those concerning the institutional work of the Red Cross to guarantee the safety of those held in Russian captivity. I believe that the International Committee of the Red Cross is not a club with privileges where they get paid and enjoy life. The Red Cross has obligations, primarily of a moral nature. The mandate of the Red Cross must be fulfilled. It is necessary to immediately do what is completely logical for the Red Cross. There is Olenivka. In fact, a concentration camp where our prisoners are kept. Access to them is required, as it was stipulated. The Red Cross can make it happen. But you have to try to make it happen. Ukraine is ready to facilitate this. The mission of the Red Cross can work on the model of the mission of the IAEA. But this requires leadership. Conscientiousness is required. Understanding who and why created such an institution as the Red Cross is required. I am grateful to the team that continues to engage in exchanges: Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Maliuk. Today, we managed to return another 20 Ukrainians from captivity. 14 warriors of the army, four warriors of the territorial defense, one national guard and one warrior of the Navy. We are working on getting everyone back! Our Air Forces continue the battle for Ukrainian skies. As in previous days, I received hourly reports of downed Russian missiles and drones. During the day, 11 missiles were fired, six missiles were shot down in Mykolaiv, Lviv and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Thank you to everyone who fulfills this task! We urgently restore damaged infrastructure objects. I also want to celebrate today the warriors of the 5th separate assault regiment of the Ground Forces, the 1st separate battalion of the marines and the battalion of the 4th brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine for their skillful and heroic actions during the defense in the Bakhmut direction. This direction is still one of the toughest on the front. Thank you to everyone who defends our positions there and inflicts tangible hits on the occupiers. Now Russia is sending thousands of its mobilized men to the front. They have no significant military training, but their command does not need it at all. They expect that the mobilized Russians will be able to survive in the war for at least a few weeks, then they will die, and then new ones will be sent to the front. But during this time, such use by Russian generals of their people as \"cannon fodder\" makes it possible to create additional pressure on our defenders. It's a tangible pressure. And I am grateful to all our warriors who endure it. I am also grateful to the partners who understand that in such conditions we need an increase in defense assistance. I thank everyone who fights, works and helps to protect Ukraine! Tomorrow we will definitely celebrate - everyone in their place - one of our most important days. Intercession, Day of Defenders of Ukraine. The holiday of all our warriors - from ancient times to the present, from the Cossacks to the insurgents, from all of them to the warriors of the modern army. Tomorrow will be the 233rd day of our full-scale defense. And new steps that bring us closer to peace and victory. We do not relax! We beat the enemy! We follow the safety rules! We listen to the air alarm signal, especially tomorrow! And we do everything to strengthen Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Great people of a great country! On October 14, we celebrate the Day of Defenders of Ukraine. This is the Day of those who fight. This is the Day of what we fight for. This is the Day of what kind of victory we will gain. A century ago, Ukraine honored this Day. And it will honor it a century after us. On October 14, we express gratitude. Gratitude to everyone who fought for Ukraine in the past. And to everyone who is fighting for it now.  To all who won then. And to everyone who will definitely win now. Win in such a way that it will crown the struggle of many generations of our people with success. The people who always wanted one thing the most - freedom. For themselves. And for their children. For our culture. The place where I am now points to the origins of our Ukrainian path. These are the slopes of Vytachiv. Here was one of the most ancient outposts of Rus’-Ukraine. Back in the times of Olga, Svyatoslav and Volodymyr the Great. Svyatopolk, Monomakh, Andriy and Oleg were gathering here for the princely congress. Andriy Pervozvanny placed the first cross here. Cossack seagulls used to cross these waters. These shores have seen various invaders and heroes. Here, on the slopes, Taras Shevchenko looked at the Dnipro and the cliffs. This place is a witness of more than a millennium of our history and its important lesson. They tried to capture and enslave the Ukrainian land. They tried to conquer and destroy the Ukrainian people. Both a thousand years ago and in the XX century. But Ukrainians come here. Here they reflect on our history. The Ukrainian language is spoken here. There is a chapel here, built according to Shevchenko's sketch. There were different periods. Various threats. But Ukraine endured. There is one reason for that. Our defenders. Our people who are fighting for their right to life. In Rus’. In Sich. During the national liberation struggle. Against the Nazi occupation. And against the Rashists. It seems that the current enemy in its evil unites all the enemies of our statehood that we faced before. And by defeating this enemy, we will respond to all enemies who encroached on Ukraine - on those who lived, who live and who will live on our land. This will be a victory for all our people. This will be a victory for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Our Ground Forces, infantry. Tankers. Missile troops and artillery. This will be a victory for our Air Forces. Our anti-aircraft warriors. Our drone operators. This will be a victory for our Naval Forces. Our marines. Our airborne assault troops. Our intelligence. Special operations forces. Security Service of Ukraine. This will be a victory for the border guards, the National Guard, the National Police, the territorial defense, and the communications officers. This will be a victory for everyone who will not leave even a trace on Ukrainian soil of that army that flaunted itself as if it was the second on the planet. This will be a victory for those of our heroes who are now in Russian captivity. Those who are now having the most difficult time. It is the most difficult to remain Ukrainian and preserve Ukrainian when they are among the murderers. But we remember. We remember and do everything to return everyone - each of our heroes. We will not leave anyone in captivity. The world sees that Ukrainians do not lose their humanity under any circumstances. The enemy can strike at our cities, but never at our dignity. The Rashists burned down the Skovoroda museum, dozens of churches, hundreds of schools and kindergartens... But they can't do anything against our philosophy. Against what Ukrainians hear, see and know - from a young age. Russian missiles are still capable of driving Ukrainians into bomb shelters, but none of our people shiver there. Ukrainians sing in shelters. We defend our freedom. Our soul. Our land. Our Kyiv. Our Zaporizhzhia. Our Odesa. Our Dnipro and Mykolaiv. Our Kryvyi Rih. Our Nikopol. Our Khmelnytskyi, our Lviv. Our Vinnytsia. What we have preserved and will always protect. Our Zhytomyr region, Kyiv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region, Kharkiv region. What we did not give away and will always protect. Our Kherson, our Donetsk and Luhansk, our Crimea. We. We all. Great people of a great country. Everyone who fights and works for Ukraine to live. Diplomats who formed the most powerful global coalition in history to help Ukraine. Volunteers who cover any needs - on the ground, in the air, and even in space. Journalists who spread the truth about Ukraine and about this war, who maintain our morale, our confidence, our awareness. Transporters who change supply chains and provide Ukraine with everything it needs. Energy workers who defeat the darkness around the clock. Builders who restore what was destroyed by the enemy. Our heroic doctors. Rescuers. Sappers. Teachers. Civil servants. Local government. Farmers. Industrialists. A nation. A nation that defeats terror. Millions of people who are bringing the crucial day closer, each in his place. Victory Day. The day of victory in the war for our freedom. In the war for independence for all our people in all corners of Ukraine. In the war for the right to life for the people and for the state, whose name is Ukraine. In the war for our values. In the war for our memory and Tradition. The tradition of freedom. In this war, everything depends on you. On what you do. On who you help. On what you gain. On who came to help us. The world stands with us. More than ever in our history. This in particular makes us stronger than ever in our history. But just as at any time in our history, the future depends on specific people. On those who are currently in the trenches and on combat posts. Sons, brothers and fathers. Daughters, sisters and mothers. Ukrainian men and women, to whom I now want to say the main words. You are the most precious thing we have. Each and every one. Rashist tanks, inmates and mercenaries oppose you. Looters, rapists and those who have gone mad from propaganda. Thousands of people whose lives are worth nothing to their state. They are thrown into attacks, they have \"anti-retreat detachments\" behind their backs, they are not counted and are not even taken away when they die. They do not know what to live for, and that's why they lose the life given to them by God so shamefully. And behind you, Ukrainian Warrior, are millions of people who know exactly what they live for. With you, Warrior, in the trenches is our entire state, everything that we have and that is so dear to us. The future of children is with you. The gold of our athletes' victories. Our poetry, art, science. Sophia and the Potocki Palace are with you. Our Khortytsia and our Lavra. Our Heavenly Hundred is with you. And our respect, our faith and our love. Because our state is the mother of all defenders. Behind you is Ukraine, which knows exactly what it wants and values. Behind you is the history that has been coming to these heroic Days for many centuries, so that you, Ukrainian Warrior, will now turn it in the right direction - forever. In the right direction for Ukraine. I know it is extremely hard for you. I know how this enemy puts pressure on you. I know what they do. But I know that you are strong, and we will do everything to make you even stronger. I know that you are confident, and we will do everything to increase your confidence even more. I know that you are bringing victory closer as much as you can, and we will do everything to speed it up. All of us - millions and millions. Great people of a great country! Happy Defender of Ukraine Day! Happy Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos! Happy Day of the Ukrainian Cossacks! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to all who fight, work and help! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear great people of the great country! This day is passing – October 14, our holiday. The holiday of all defenders of Ukraine, the Feast of the Patronage of the Most Holy Mother of God. Day of the Cossacks. The 233rd day of our full-scale defense in the war for freedom for Ukraine. I want to thank now all our people who today congratulated each other, who congratulated our military, all our soldiers. I want to thank those who continued to work today for the sake of our strength. I want to thank everyone who spent this day, like many others, in battle and on guard duty. In Mykolayiv region and Kherson region, in Zaporizhzhia region, in Dnipropetrovsk region, in Donbas, in Kharkiv region. In Odesa region and in the center of our country, in the north and west – in all our regions. Along our state border. I thank everyone who guards our sky, our sea and our cyberspace. And I would like to thank everyone who today, quietly, silently, even in their hearts, but together with the whole country celebrated the Day of Defenders of Ukraine, being in the temporarily occupied territory or forcibly in the territory of Russia. Ukraine remembers everyone. We will leave no one and nothing Ukrainian to the enemy. Let's liberate all ours. We will return everything that is rightfully ours. We know that we can do it. And we must do it. It will definitely be like that. We must restore peace. And let's do it. We must secure a historic victory for our country. And it will be. Look like the enemy is disturbed. Listen to what and how they ask the leader of these terrorists when he does go out to people, to journalists. Russia is already in the atmosphere of its defeat, already in the atmosphere of hopelessness for itself. Yes, they still have people they throw into attacks. They have weapons, missiles and Shahed UAVs, which they use against Ukraine. They still have the opportunity to terrorize our cities and all Europeans, blackmail the world. But they have no chance. And it won't be, because Ukraine is moving forward. Today, I had the honor to present Crosses of Combat Merit and Gold Star orders to our heroes. In total, 483 soldiers were awarded state awards on the occasion of the holiday. Fifteen were awarded the title Hero of Ukraine. I visited our wounded soldiers in the hospital. I thanked the doctors and nurses for their work – great work, professional. I held a meeting of the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. We discussed the situation on the front line, the actions of the enemy and our steps to liberate Ukrainian territory. In addition, the supply of ammunition, preparation for winter. It was a very substantial meeting. Reconstruction work in the regions after the recent series of Russian terrorist attacks continues. The technical possibility of electricity supply has been restored in most regions. Although in some cities and districts, power companies are still forced to use stabilization shutdown schedules. Fifteen objects that the Russian terrorists wanted to destroy have already been completely restored. We will restore all the others. I draw your attention, dear Ukrainians: please, it is still necessary to advisedly limit the consumption of electricity during peak hours so that the entire power system works stably. It is also an element of the protection of our state. I spoke with a friend of all Ukraine –President of Lithuania Nausėda. About our defense needs and further Euro-Atlantic integration. I also held a meeting on the state of the Euro-Atlantic movement of our country and security guarantees for Ukraine. The Government, the Verkhovna Rada, the Office – all are involved. I spoke today with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. We discussed our possibilities to act together in the interests of our states and peoples. I believe that the desired results are possible. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to our beautiful people! I'm thankful to everyone who defends and rebuilds, who works and helps, who fights and wins! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health! We have a new defense assistance package from the United States valued at $725 million. These are very necessary things. Ammunition for HIMARS and artillery, anti-tank weapons, anti-radar missiles. I thank President Biden, bipartisan Congress, and the entire American nation for this strong package. We are doing everything to reduce the capabilities of the occupiers, the ability of the Russian army to carry terror through Ukrainian land. We are consistently destroying the logistics of terrorists, their warehouses and headquarters. The total losses of the enemy in terms of killed people are approaching 65,000. So many citizens of Russia gave their lives for the possibility of a handful of people in the Kremlin to ignore reality. And according to the way the Russian \"burial operation\" continues, we can say that even 100,000 dead Russian citizens will not prompt the Kremlin to think a little bit. Only real victories of Ukraine, only real defending of itself by the free world from Russian terror and blackmail – protection with sanctions, protection with help to Ukraine – only complete displacement of the occupiers from Ukrainian land and dismantling of the aggressive capabilities of the terrorist state – all this is the way to peace. Peace will become possible when its terror becomes impossible for Russia. Today and yesterday, various regions of our country were targets of Russian attacks. In particular, by missiles and Iranian drones. Some of the missiles and drones were shot down. But, unfortunately, not all. Unfortunately, there is destruction and casualties. Donbas, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv region, Kharkiv region, Sumy region, Kyiv region, Dnipropetrovsk region and some other regions of our country... We are doing everything to shoot down more enemy missiles and drones to neutralize more strike positions of the Russian army. And the day will surely come when our state will be able to fulfill this task one hundred percent. Today, I want to thank all our people who are promptly eliminating the consequences of the Russian terrorist attacks: our energy workers, employees of the State Emergency Service, communal services and local authorities, construction workers, employees of the National Police, government officials who coordinate the recovery process. Although in some of our cities and districts the power companies are still forced to limit the supply of electricity to maintain the stability of the system, we are doing and will do everything to restore the technical capabilities for supply. Also, in the liberated areas of Kharkiv region, Kherson region, and Donetsk region (in Lyman, Sviatohirsk) we are working to restore order, social and medical services, energy supply, communication and mail, water supply and gas, where it is possible. For example, they began to restore gas supply to Izium – the first 500 families of the city already have gas in their homes again. Just yesterday, more than 3,000 houses in the Izium, Kupiansk, Chuhuyiv and Kharkiv districts of Kharkiv region were connected to the gas supply. Work is ongoing in other directions as well. I'm thankful to everyone who is returning normal life to Ukrainians! Active operations continue in various areas of the front. A very difficult situation persists in Donetsk region and Luhansk region. The most difficult is the Bakhmut direction, as in the previous days. We hold our positions. In general, in the east and south, we do everything to make the occupiers feel that they have no prospects. No matter who they send to fight against us, it will only end in defeat for them. Well, I will once again remind the citizens of Russia, who do not want to participate in this criminal war, but who are sent to war, of one possibility. All who surrender themselves to Ukrainian captivity will save their lives. Anyone who continues to fight in the Russian army or among mercenaries does not have such an opportunity. Ukraine will definitely return everything that belongs to it. Eternal glory to all who fight for our country! Eternal honor to everyone who helps us overcome Russian terror! Eternal gratitude to all who work for our victory! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! World Food Day is celebrated on October 16. This day is established in memory of the establishment of the UN special structure dealing with poverty and famine - FAO. This is the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. For decades, the world has worked to solve the problem of famine. And it is unlikely that any of the founders of the UN could have thought at the time that in the XXI century all of us in the world will again be forced to fight the threat of mass famine, moreover artificial famine! A famine for which only one country in the world is responsible - Russia - and its terrorist war against the free world. When Russia blocked our Ukrainian ports and disrupted normal food supply chains, it returned the world to a situation as if these decades of work for international food security had never existed. Fortunately, Ukrainian ports started working again for the export of agricultural products. Since July, we have been supplying exactly the amount of food that restores stability to the world market. And precisely to those segments of the food market that ensure the consumption of some of the most fragile countries in Africa and Asia. And although our export capabilities are still far from complete, we managed to export almost 8 million tons of food by sea - that's more than 300 ships. 60% of this volume was directed to Africa and Asia. This is the global mission of our country: and thanks to Ukrainian supplies, entire regions of the world maintain social and political security. And I want to thank everyone who ensures this: first of all our farmers, our transporters, port workers, our diplomats and government officials. Of course, our defenders, who hold the south and restore safety to the sea. And I want to thank our partners who managed to help with this initiative. In particular, UN Secretary-General Guterres and President of Türkiye Erdoğan. We must do everything so that Ukrainian grain exports only expand. These are jobs for our people and export income. Plus funds to ensure a sowing campaign next year. And for the whole world this is one of the key guarantees of stability. The way Ukraine helps maintain normal life in the world only strengthens the reputation of our state and makes it easier for us to establish new ties in different regions. This upcoming week, I expect new international results for our state. And for the past week, it is worth noting the strengthening of contacts with Saudi Arabia. There are significant agreements. Among other things, this is the decision of the partners to provide a package of humanitarian support in the amount of 400 million dollars. It is very important. Right now we have the most meaningful relations with Saudi Arabia in 30 years. The situation on the frontline has not undergone significant changes over the past day. The key hotspots in Donbas are Soledar and Bakhmut, where extremely heavy fighting continues. The occupiers threw everyone they could against our forces, including 2,000 \"prisoners\" - they are among the mercenaries right there. And these are \"convicts\" with long sentences for serious crimes. They are kept at the front not only with money, but also with the promise of amnesty. This is how the Russian state sponsors terror - it looks for murderers in prisons and promises them freedom if they kill again. Does anyone in the world still doubt whether Russia should be officially designated as a terrorist state? I don't think so. I thank all our warriors who are heroically holding their positions near Bakhmut, near Soledar and in all other directions where military clashes are currently ongoing - in the east, in the south of the country. Today, in the Southern direction, I especially want to celebrate the 60th Inhulets Infantry Brigade, the 17th Separate Kryvyi Rih Tank Brigade named after Kostiantyn Pestushko, the 128th Separate Mountain Assault Zakarpattia Brigade and the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade named after Yakov Handziuk for coordinated actions in the Kherson direction and effective destruction of enemy equipment. I thank you, warriors! I also thank the Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigade for successfully protecting our skies from Iranian drones and Russian aircraft. Separately, I would like to note today those units that provided us with the result of replenishment of the exchange fund. This is extremely important - everyone who captures the Russian military provides us with the opportunity to release our heroes. I thank the 54th Separate Reconnaissance Battalion named after Mykhailo Tysha, the 80th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade and the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, which during the offensive significantly increased our ability to return Ukrainians home. We remember our people detained in Russia. We must liberate them, and we must liberate them all, leaving none to the enemy. But for this we need to capture the occupiers - as many as possible. And one more thing worth talking about today. Due to the Russian missile terror in some cities and regions of Ukraine, energy workers have to limit the supply of electricity so that the entire system works stably. But it will be possible to avoid such stabilization blackouts if all of us in Ukraine consciously treat our consumption during peak hours. This is a small thing for every person's life - but extremely tangible within the entire energy system. For example, this Saturday residents of the Chernihiv region limited their electricity consumption by 20 percent. I am very grateful to you. And in general in the country on average - by 10 percent. Kyiv and the region - only by 7 percent. Please do more - if you have the opportunity. From 17:00 to 23:00 we must reduce our electricity consumption. This is a step that, along with others, will ensure the failure of Russian terrorist plans. I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine! I am grateful to everyone who fights, works and helps for our victory! Unity and joint actions are our strength, the strength of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Strong people of the indomitable country! Today was a difficult day. The morning of a new Russian terrorist attack. Hours of clearing debris and eliminating the consequences of strikes. The evening of battles for Ukraine and news for Ukraine. The next stage of the release of our people from Russian captivity took place - we managed to return 108 Ukrainian women. Officers, sergeants, privates. Army, Navy, territorial defense, National Guard, border guards. 96 are servicemen, 37 of them are evacuees from Azovstal. 12 - civilians. Among those released today are those who were captured long before the full-scale war. We do not forget about any of our people - we have to return them all. And we will return them all. Our exchange team continues this work: Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Maliuk, Lubinets and others. I am grateful to all involved for this success, and I also thank all those who replenish our exchange fund, who ensure the capture of enemies. The more Russian prisoners we have, the sooner we will be able to free our heroes. Every Ukrainian warrior, every frontline commander should remember this. Throughout the day, the clearing of rubble continues in those places where the Russian terrorists managed to hit today. In Kyiv, they killed a young family, targeting an apartment building with an Iranian \"Shahed\". A guy and a 6 months pregnant girl... Vladimir Putin can mark another \"achievement\" - he killed another pregnant woman. In total, four people were killed by this \"Shahed\" alone. There were other hits. More than 25 settlements of our country were attacked this night and morning. Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror! Right now there is a new Russian drone attack - there are downings. The world can and must stop this terror. When we talk about Ukraine's need for air and missile defense, we are talking about real lives that are being taken by terrorists. We manage to shoot down some of the missiles and drones. In just 12 hours from 9 p.m. Sunday, 37 Iranian \"Shaheds\" and several cruise missiles were destroyed. But in order to guarantee the protection of our skies and to reduce the capabilities of Russian terrorists to zero, we need significantly more modern air defense systems and a greater missile provision for such systems. And this is not only Ukrainian interest. The fewer terrorist opportunities Russia has, the sooner this war will end. Russia stands no chance on the battlefield. And it tries to cover up its military defeats with terror. Why does it need terror? To put pressure on us, on Europe, on the whole world. Terrorists must be neutralized. This rule applies equally effectively everywhere, and it will affect Russian terror in the same way. When Russian terror capabilities are neutralized by the joint efforts with our partners, Russia will have no choice but to think about peace. And I thank all our Air Force fighters, anti-aircraft fighters, other warriors who are involved in countering Russian attacks! Every Russian missile shot down and every drone destroyed is a life saved. I am also grateful to everyone who is involved in eliminating the consequences of terrorist attacks: our rescuers, policemen, doctors, energy workers, utility workers, heads of local self-government, government officials and business representatives who help. Today's Russian missile and drone attack also caused new power outages, but this is being corrected. Restoration work is ongoing. This form of terror will not give Russia anything even now, when we still do not have a sufficient number of air defense and missile defense systems. But for this our unity must stay maximal. Please take the request of energy providers into account and consciously consume electricity during the hours of peak load on the power system. This will enable the whole country to go through this period more stably. Please help local communities eliminate the consequences of terrorist attacks, if your business has the opportunity to do so. Please take care of your acquaintances and neighbors who are alone and need attention or help, especially the elderly. And be sure to thank those who are involved in the defense of our state and in eliminating the consequences of terrorist attacks, who maintain normal life despite any attempts by Russia to break it. Our unity, our attention to each other, our ability to fight and work together for common interests is a guarantee of Ukrainian victory and the defeat of terrorists. There is no such weapon in Iran or elsewhere that can break a nation that is aware of what it is fighting for and what it will never forgive the enemy for. I spoke today with the President of the United Arab Emirates. I thanked him for supporting Ukraine, particularly at the level of the UN and other international organizations. We discussed the threat posed by Russia to global food security. I assured Mr. President that Ukraine can and will remain a guarantor of food security and, therefore, social stability of all our partners. We are preparing for important negotiations scheduled for this and next week on further defense and financial support for our country. We will do everything for the victory of Ukraine. Eternal glory to all our warriors! Eternal glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today, the battle for a normal life for our people continued. There were new Russian attacks against our energy system. Some of the drones and missiles were shot down. Thanks again for this to our anti-aircraft fighters, our Air Forces. In particular, the 138th Dnipro anti-aircraft missile brigade for shooting down four \"Kalibrs\". Our other defenders of the sky also have good results. Today, I will also celebrate the Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigade for shooting down a Russian Su-25 attack aircraft. Thanks also to our partners - everyone who helps us with anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense. For example, the German \"IRIS-T\" has shown itself very well - it is a really effective system. We are working with partners to provide even more protection to the Ukrainian sky. Over the past day, more than 10 Ukrainian regions suffered terrorist attacks. Zhytomyr region and Kyiv region, Sumy region, Dnipro and Kryvyi Rih, Kharkiv region and Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and other cities of the south of Ukraine, Donbas. Wherever possible, we are trying to speed up restoration work. But now, just like in the previous days, the overall situation still requires a very conscious consumption of electricity and limiting the use of energy-consuming appliances during peak hours. The more conscious our household consumption of electricity is from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., the more stable our energy system will be. Everyone who follows this simple rule for peak hours helps the entire country. Please explain this to your relatives, friends and neighbors to guide our national unity towards a common and much needed result. Today I had a lot of meetings and communication regarding infrastructure restoration. Another general meeting on the energy situation is scheduled for tomorrow. We are working out all possible scenarios. And, of course, all this is combined with our measures to strengthen defense against drones. We should remember that the very fact of Russia's appeal to Iran for such assistance is the Kremlin's recognition of its military and political bankruptcy. For decades, they’ve been spending billions of dollars on their military-industrial complex, and in the end they went to bow to Tehran to get rather simple drones and missiles. It won't help them strategically anyway. It only further proves to the world that Russia is on the trajectory of its defeat and is trying to draw someone else into its accomplices in terror. We will definitely ensure an appropriate international reaction to this. But now, at the tactical level, the terrorists may still have certain hopes, calculations, new illusions due to Iranian drones. All this will fall apart, just as their previous calculations. 237 days of this war prove that we are able to find an answer to any threats. If we act together - all Ukrainians and nations of the free world. Today we have an important decision from Estonia - its parliament designated Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. And this is another European step to ensure that the actual reality of Russian terror and the European official attitude towards Russia completely coincide. Terror must receive all types of response - on the battlefield, with sanctions and legally. I am grateful to our Estonian friends for this! We will continue our work at all levels so that other countries adopt similar decisions. I held a meeting on working out in UN structures our draft resolution on the creation of a compensation mechanism that would provide compensation at the expense of Russian assets for all the damage caused by this war. We are gradually moving in this direction as well. The terrorist state will inevitably pay for everything it has done. Another expansion of our United24 platform took place today. This public fundraising platform has already raised more than $200 million from people in dozens of countries. Oleksandr Usyk became the new ambassador of United24. I just spoke with him and thanked him for his willingness to work for Ukraine. Oleksandr will focus on projects devoted to the reconstruction of our country, in particular in the Kyiv region. Let me just remind you that Andriy Shevchenko, Elina Svitolina, Imagine Dragons, creative director of Balenciaga Demna, Liev Schreiber, Barbra Streisand and Mark Hamill are already ambassadors along with Usyk. Today, 2 billion euros of macro-financial aid from the European Union were allocated to Ukraine's accounts. This is important for us - for the social support of our people. We are very grateful. We expect other tranches under this package with a total volume of 9 billion euros. I am grateful to all friends of Ukraine! I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for our victory! No matter what the enemy plans and does, our perspective is clear: Ukraine will defend itself. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Today was quite a fruitful day. I met with the European Commissioner for Crisis Management. I thanked Mr. Lenarčič for all the assistance that was provided during the full-scale war. We discussed what other humanitarian needs of our people could be met with the help of our European friends. Of course, we touched on the situation with energy. I spoke today with the President of Turkey. I thanked him for supporting our territorial integrity. We discussed the key security issues currently Ukraine and our entire region are facing. The key topics are efforts to further release our people from Russian captivity, defense cooperation, export of Ukrainian food. I held negotiations with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece – he arrived on a visit to Kyiv for the third time since February 24. I thanked Greece for its support in the defense sector. We agreed to strengthen our cooperation in bilateral relations and at the level of the European Union, as well as at the level of NATO. Tomorrow I will participate in the European Summit – I will contact my partners. The key topic, of course, is challenges to our energy, both Ukrainian and European. We will respond to the terrorist threat together. Today, Andriy Yermak met with representatives of the embassies of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain at the Office and discussed the strengthening of our anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense. We are working to guarantee the complete safety of the Ukrainian sky. We already have significant results: 233 Shahed UAVs and dozens of missiles were shot down during the month. Ten Iranian drones were destroyed today and this is only in the Kyiv direction. Another 11 Shahed UAVs were shot down thanks to the soldiers of the Pivden air command. Thanks guys for the great job! There are results in other areas as well. But, unfortunately, there are also impacts. We have new damage to critical infrastructure. Today, three energy facilities were destroyed by the enemy. Of course, we will do everything possible to restore the normal energy capabilities of our country. But it takes time. And this requires our joint efforts. Tomorrow they are needed even more than before. There will be clarifications from the heads of regional administrations and government officials, but in general, it is necessary to be especially conscious of electricity consumption from 7 am tomorrow. Please do not turn on unnecessary electrical appliances. Please limit your electricity consumption and use those appliances that consume a lot of energy. Tomorrow, it is very important that the consumption is as conscious as possible, and thus the schedules of stabilization blackouts will be shorter. I held a general meeting on energy issues today – the Office, government, energy companies. We are preparing for all possible scenarios in view of the winter season. We assume that Russian terror will be directed at energy facilities until, with the help of partners, we ensure the ability to shoot down 100% of enemy missiles and drones. Separately, today I want to address our people in the temporarily occupied areas of southern and eastern Ukraine. In the near future, the occupiers will try to recruit men into their army. Everywhere is the same as in Donetsk and Luhansk. Please avoid it as much as you can. Try to leave the occupied territory. If you cannot do this and find yourself in Russian military structures, at the first opportunity try to lay down your arms and come to Ukrainian positions. And most importantly, protect your life. And be sure to help our other people who are close to you. Our common task is to persevere. Stand against these weirdoes… Russia avoided even the word \"war\" for six months, punished its own people with criminal cases for it, and now it declares martial law in the occupied territory. The occupiers themselves brought the war to our land under their constant false pretense of alleged negotiations, and now they are signing some decrees cementing the war. Well, what can I say? It's just hysterics of the \"Chekist comrades.\" Hysterics, which will be greater the closer Russia's defeat is. In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our soldiers. Seventy one servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards today. I thank everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! I thank everyone who helps our defense! And I would like to thank separately for the fact that it was the Ukrainian people who this year became the laureate of the special honor of the European Parliament – the Sakharov Prize. This award is given annually to those who have made the greatest contribution to the defense of democracy, human rights and European values. It is really important that all Ukrainian men and women – millions of our people who so bravely defend freedom were recognized in Europe this year. Glory to our beautiful people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you very much, Charles, thank you very much, dear Mr. President! Dear colleagues! I am glad to greet all of you and want to immediately, without wasting time, move on to issues that are vitally important now not only for Ukraine, but also - I am sure - for the entire European Community as well. There is a new escalation in Russian terror. And this requires us to take new steps in response - quick steps in solidarity. Steps that will protect both Ukrainians and all Europeans. The current leadership of Russia has been working for years to turn energy resources into weapons. Fortunately, this plan of theirs fails. Despite the critical dependence of some European countries on Russian gas, oil and oil products, the European Union managed to ensure energy independence thanks to effective leadership both at the EU level and at the level of national governments. European gas storages are full, alternative supply to the continent is established. This is your absolute success. Unfortunately, the very serious challenge of the price crisis, which Russia ignited and fuels to provoke social tension in European countries, still remains. This is Russia's calculated pressure on the family budget of every European family. But I believe that socially just solutions can be found to overcome this challenge as well. You know that Ukraine offered its help so that we could all get through this winter together in better conditions. In particular, we started exporting electricity to the EU - and this was a very significant contribution to Europe's energy and price stability. However, such help of ours became an obvious target of Russian terrorists. Unable to use energy resources as a weapon, the current leadership of Russia has given the order to turn the energy system itself into a battlefield. The consequences of this are very dangerous – again for all of us in Europe. Attacks by Russian cruise missiles and Iranian combat drones have destroyed more than a third of our energy infrastructure. Because of this, unfortunately we are no longer able to export electricity to help you maintain stability. However, this is only part of the problem. Russia also provokes a new wave of migration of Ukrainians to EU countries. Russian terror against our energy facilities is aimed at creating as many problems as possible with electricity and heat for Ukraine this fall and winter so that as many Ukrainians as possible move to your countries. The terrorist state has already worsened the social conditions in your countries - but it wants to worsen it further by provoking a wave of resettlement. This should be answered immediately. The first answer is fundamental - it is air defense and anti-missile defense. We must do everything possible to make it completely impossible for Russia to destroy our energy system with missiles and drones. We have already received a very effective IRIS-T system from Germany. I thank Mr. Chancellor for that. This German system protects not only Ukrainian skies. It protects European stability, limiting Russian terror, which strikes both our country and, in the future, your countries. But we need more air defense and anti-missile defense systems to create a truly reliable air shield. I know that some EU countries have already confirmed their participation in this work. And I urge you to accelerate the implementation of decisions as much as possible. I am now turning to France, Italy, and our other partners – not only in Europe, but also in the United States of America. Not only to those who produce air defense and anti-missile defense systems, but also to those who have the necessary systems. The more protected Ukrainian skies are, the more stable life will be in all of Europe. We have to ensure it. The second answer should be sanctions. New powerful sanctions against Russia and Iran for collaboration with the terrorist state. Although we have destroyed more than two hundred Iranian drones this month alone, and dozens have hit various targets, Iranian representatives are still lying as if they did not provide the drones to Russia. Russia must pay for this terror – and this must be reflected in the ninth EU sanctions package. Iran must be deprived of any possibility or even desire to supply such drones to anyone. It is good that the first step has already taken place - new individual sanctions against Iranian figures and companies have been approved. But a few individuals and companies are not a responsibility yet. More systematic steps are needed. We can, and therefore must, do everything to ensure that this terrorist plan of the Russian leadership also fails. Never again should the energy system of any country turn into a battlefield. Right now, using the examples of Russia and Iran, we can show what awaits any terrorist state if it tries to attack Europeans or any other people like this. Anyone who calls for the mitigation of sanctions against Russia for terror or tries to politically torpedo the sanctions mechanism is not only trying to make Russian terror go unpunished, and not only betrays the memory of the victims of terror, but also makes the entire European Community dependent on the most anti-European power in the modern world. Pay attention to such voices in Europe - they are against Europe. Please do not forget about the aspect with Belarus. You know very well that we are doing everything to prevent the involvement of the people of Belarus in a war against our state. But since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion, missiles have been launched against Ukraine from Belarusian territory, and now Iranian drones have been added. Therefore, sanctions should be added for such an accomplice. And our proposal to send international observers to the border of Ukraine and Belarus to monitor the security situation is becoming more relevant every day. But that's not all. Russia is deliberately creating the grounds for a large-scale disaster in the south of Ukraine. We have information that Russian terrorists mined the dam and aggregates of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. This is one of the large power facilities. The dam of this hydroelectric power plant holds about 18 million cubic meters of water. If Russian terrorists blow up this dam, more than 80 settlements, including Kherson, will be in the zone of rapid flooding. Hundreds, hundreds of thousands of people may be affected. The water supply of a large part of the south of Ukraine may be destroyed. This Russian terrorist attack could leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant without water for cooling – water for the ZNPP is taken from the Kakhovka Reservoir. Even the operation of the canal, which was built to supply water to Crimea and which is periodically allegedly \"cared about\" by Moscow, will be completely destroyed. This is the real attitude of Russia towards our Ukrainian Crimea. And in general, the devastating environmental, humanitarian, man-made consequences of this single Russian terrorist attack may become such that it will be called a historical disaster. According to our information, Russia has already prepared everything to carry out this terrorist attack. Ukrainian workers were kicked out of the Kakhovka station - only Russian citizens stay there. They have complete control over the station. It is necessary to act immediately so that Russia does not have the opportunity to realize this catastrophe. An international observation mission to the Kakhovka HPP is needed. It is necessary to return the Ukrainian personnel there and ensure immediate and professional demining of the aggregates and the dam. Russia is doing this in order to organize another false flag operation - to carry out a terrorist attack and blame Ukraine for it. But we know what the truth is. We know that this territory is controlled by the occupiers and what they were capable of already. They themselves will stop at nothing. But we can stop them. We can stop the onset of catastrophic consequences. We can, and therefore we must! And one more thing. Reconstruction. Whatever terrorist plans Russia and its accomplices may have, we must care about life. When we have reliable protection of the sky - that is, a sufficient number and quality of air defense and missile defense systems - we will be able to guarantee a normal economic and social life in Ukraine. These are opportunities for our cooperation with you - and therefore for economic growth and new jobs. Jobs not only in Ukraine, but also in your countries. When we can guarantee that the Russian terror at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant stopped, we will be able to return to a stable energy supply for Ukrainians, and therefore to the export of electricity to our European neighbors. Under these conditions - a protected sky and protected energy sphere - we will be able to proceed to a larger scale of reconstruction in Ukraine. And it is not just about the economy and the social sphere. It is not just about security. It is also about the prestige of Europe. I hope that in the near future, namely on October 25 in Germany during the Ukraine Recovery Conference, we will discuss how we will together prove that the effectiveness of our unity and our institutions is much more powerful than any anti-European terror. Russian, Iranian or any other. But without waiting for the next week and the start of the Conference, I would like to point out today that we need more support in the implementation of our Fast Recovery Plan. That is, in the priority measures for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the terrorist attacks. You have all this data - what we need exactly. We already have an understanding of the necessary funds. This is 3 and a half billion euros this year and about 14 billion euros next year. And so far we have received zero from these funds. And they are vital. As well as the next tranches of macro-financial aid for Ukraine are vital. Thank you for the funds that have already been allocated, but a decision has not yet been made on the remaining 6 billion from this package - which is critically needed this year. And it is in your power to reach a principled agreement on the provision of this assistance to our state today already. Terror must lose. Ukraine and all of Europe must win. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! I look forward to prompt and effective decisions of the European Community. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I took part in the meeting of the European Council. The topic of protection of Ukraine and our energy security was among the key issues at this summit. I informed my colleagues about the new terrorist steps of Russia and about our needs to protect ourselves from this form of terror directed against the energy system. Russian troops continue to strike our power plants with missiles and drones. In the end, such Russian meanness will also fail. We are doing everything to get more modern and effective air defense and missile defense systems for Ukraine. And there will be a day when we announce that the Ukrainian sky has become completely protected from Russian missiles, Iranian drones and any other carriers of evil. Russia tried to blackmail Europe with gas and oil, organizes sabotage on underwater gas pipelines and critical cables in Europe, tried and is still trying to freeze people... And what happened? Russia has only lost its weight in the European energy market, which it has been gaining since Brezhnev's era, and will definitely be treated as the most reckless international criminal. This will remain with Moscow for a very long time even after this Russian leader. Russia is trying to destroy the energy system of Ukraine, to make our people suffer even more, but this only mobilizes the international community to help us even more and put even more pressure on the terrorist state. And all our expenses for the protection of our energy facilities and for the restoration of our infrastructure after Russian terrorist attacks will be reimbursed at the expense of Russian assets. Each of the terrorists will be personally responsible for what he does. Before the court. And the terrorist state will pay for its terror. With isolation, degradation and assets - both of state and quasi-private entities connected with this Russian regime. I informed the Europeans today, during the meeting of the European Council, about the next terrorist attack, which Russia is preparing for at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. According to our information, the aggregates and dam of the Kakhovka HPP were mined by Russian terrorists. Now everyone in the world must act powerfully and quickly to prevent a new Russian terrorist attack. Destroying the dam would mean a large-scale disaster. Of course, we understand that the occupiers do not care what happens to the territory of Ukraine. With this terrorist attack, they can destroy, among other things, even the possibility of supplying water from the Dnipro River to Crimea. In the event of the destruction of the Kakhovka HPP dam, the North Crimean Canal will simply disappear. And if Russia is preparing such a terrorist attack, if it is seriously considering such a scenario, it means the terrorists are clearly aware that they will not be able to keep not only Kherson, but also the entire south of our country, including Crimea. We must now all together - all Europeans, all world leaders, all international organizations - make it clear to the terrorist state that such a terrorist attack on the Kakhovka HPP will mean exactly the same as the use of weapons of mass destruction. The consequences for Russia should be corresponding. The world must react preventively. This is key now. The principle of preventive response to security threats should finally become one of the basic principles of international politics. Today I had a productive call with the President of Germany. I thanked him and the German people for supporting Ukraine in the struggle for freedom and for the decision to provide concrete assistance to our country. In particular, Germany became the first country to supply us with the modern IRIS-T air defense system. We expect the delivery of other such systems both from Germany and from our other partners. I held talks with the President of Switzerland, who arrived in Kyiv today. This shows the whole world that Switzerland does not remain morally neutral when such a terrorist war is being waged against Ukraine and the whole of Europe. Switzerland has supported EU sanctions packages and provides us with humanitarian aid. The issues of reconstruction of Ukraine and the possibilities of Switzerland to invest in the development of our economy and infrastructure were discussed substantively today with Mr. President. We also discussed the issue of compensation for damages caused to Ukraine by Russian terror. I am grateful that Russian assets worth $6.5 billion have already been frozen. This work must be continued. And this is something in which Switzerland must not remain morally neutral either. The possibilities of Switzerland to help with digitization in Ukraine and restoration of telecommunications systems in the liberated territories were discussed separately and substantively. The situation on the frontline remains difficult. Especially in Donbas - the same Bakhmut direction - and in some directions in the south. But we stand our ground. We defend our land. We move gradually, ousting the enemy. And we will definitely ensure victory for Ukraine. In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 148 defenders of Ukraine were awarded orders and medals. Today, at the request of our military command, I would like to celebrate warriors from the 7th anti-aircraft self-propelled artillery battery of the 3rd anti-aircraft missile division of the 1039th anti-aircraft missile regiment. During another Russian missile strike, the battery provided protection in the north of our country and destroyed an enemy missile in the Vyshhorod district of the Kyiv region. Thank you guys for the excellent service and consistently good results! Every downed Russian missile means saved lives of our people. Today we have both downed missiles and downed Iranian drones. Unfortunately, we do not shoot down all of them yet. There are also hits, there is destruction. But we will do everything to provide full protection to our sky. Terrorists always lose. Freedom always wins. Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Eternal glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear participants of our meeting! Thank you for your attention to Ukraine! Your attention means that you really value freedom and are ready to defend it. This is what Europe needs most now - unity in the fight for freedom. And doing more together, as our common enemy is trying to do more every day. Look - two states that have been regular participants before are now absent at the Frankfurt fair. These are Russia and Iran. They are becoming less present in the space of culture, but more present where everything is being destroyed - not only culture, but also life and everything that provides it. I keep getting reports about where Iranian attack drones purchased by Russia have hit. Power plants, water pipelines, ports, railway stations, warehouses with humanitarian aid, residential buildings, schools - everything becomes a target for them... Instead of exporting culture, Iran exports death. Instead of importing culture, Russia imports death and directs it against us. And not just against Ukrainians. Not only. But against Ukraine as the first battlefield of Russia's battle with a united Europe as of now. And it is obvious. But not everyone admits this obviousness. We must speak frankly - there are still enough figures in Europe who call for \"understanding\" Russia and try to ignore the terrorist policy of states like Iran. There are such people in various spheres - in politics, business, in NGOs and in the media. Why is this possible? What leads to this? One answer: lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge in the public majority. Lack of knowledge about murders committed by Russia. Lack of knowledge about crimes that combine different anti-democratic regimes. Lack of knowledge about corruption, which has become their tool to lower Europe's vigilance. Lack of knowledge about injustice and lies, which are integral elements of the policy of any terrorist state. When people do not know something, it is easier for politicians to manipulate them. When societies do not pay attention to relations with other states, business magnates can resort to any immorality in these relations. When injustice in a country is not noticed, terror may come from that country. Remember that Russian state killers took revenge on opponents of the government on German streets, too. Took revenge with bullets. But are you safe from explosions? Or from killer drones? These are not rhetorical questions. Russia has done enough to show that it does not recognize any borders. So I'm asking you - please do everything you can to let people know. Know about the terror that Russia brought to Ukraine. And before that - to Chechnya, to Georgia, to Syria, to African countries, where Russian mercenaries decided who would live and who would die... Please write about it. Read about it. Do everything so that the Europeans know how many people died in the struggle for the rights and elementary respect that each and every one of you has simply from birth... Died in Russia, in Iran, in other similar countries. Create, print, distribute books about those who weakened Europe with their decisions - due to corruption or simply indifference. Let people know about them. About those who gave strength to terrorist states or even now are trying to do everything so that there is no strong reaction to their terror. And be sure to spread the stories about the victories of freedom. People should know this. They should know that freedom can endure even when it seems to many that it will not. Just as Ukraine endured Russia's attack this year. Europeans should not forget that murderers and torturers are still brought to justice - even if they had considerable power and influence. Remind people about it. Thanks to this knowledge, they will feel that the current perpetrators of the policy of genocide and war criminals can really be brought to justice, too. Knowledge is the answer. The answer to all those who fear, who manipulate and who do not believe. Books, documentary scenarios, articles, reports - all this is the answer. I invite all of you to Ukraine - publishers and authors, businessmen and public figures, educators, journalists - everyone! Look at what our people are going through. What we have already managed to achieve. What threats we still face. Take a look - and tell about it. Tell about it, because it threatens the other nations of Europe as well. As long as terrorist states still exist. Let us do more together than any of our enemies can do together against us! Thank you again for your attention! Long live Europe! Long live freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. The main points of the agenda are quite obvious - the protection of our skies from enemy missiles and drones, the protection of infrastructure facilities, the destruction of the positions of the occupiers, the advancement of our forces and everything necessary to support the army. Military, intelligence, ministers delivered reports. Every day we are bringing the results Ukraine needs both on the ground and in the air. We are also working on the necessary results at sea. The situation around the Export Grain Initiative is becoming more and more tense these weeks. The enemy is doing everything to slow down our food exports. I believe that with these actions, Russia is deliberately inciting the food crisis so that it becomes as acute as it was in the first half of this year. Today, more than 150 ships are in the queue to fulfill contractual obligations for the supply of our agricultural products. This is an artificial queue. It arose only because Russia is deliberately delaying the passage of ships. Every day that ships with food spend in the queue means an increase in social and political tension in the countries that consume our agricultural products. Here are just some of the states to which food exports are delayed due to Russia: Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Iraq, China, Bangladesh, Indonesia. Our partners - the UN, Türkiye and others are fully informed about this situation. During the operation of our grain initiative, due to the Russian slowdown, we under-exported about 3 million tons of food. This is the annual volume of consumption for 10 million people. Russia is doing everything to ensure that at least hundreds of thousands of these people become forced migrants who will seek asylum in the same Türkiye or EU countries, or die of hunger. And we, together with our partners, must do everything so that the grain initiative is not only preserved, but also works at 100% capacity. The right to food and to life without hunger are fundamental rights for absolutely every person on earth. And that is why Russian attempts to exacerbate the food crisis are also aggression against every person on earth. I held a meeting today with representatives of the U.S. Congress who arrived in Kyiv. I thanked them for their continued bipartisan support and for the tremendously powerful things America is doing to help us protect freedom. We discussed the key issue for today - anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense. We also talked about financial support, about our political interaction, about what new anti-European and anti-democratic steps to expect from Russia and its accomplices in terror. We touched upon the topic of Iranian supplies for Russian terror. Today, this terror against our infrastructure, against our energy will be discussed by the UN Security Council. The meeting is convened at the request of our state and will take place at 10:00 p.m. I met with the President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. I thanked her for the help and informed about our new needs that have arisen due to the Russian terror. The EBRD is already providing financial support to Ukrenergo, and has all the data on what steps we need to take to restore energy and social facilities, to build housing for Ukrainians. We agreed upon positions on the eve of the Conference on the reconstruction of our state, which is to be held in Germany on October 25. Today, during the day, an air alert was announced in most regions of Ukraine. There are new downings of drones and enemy aircraft. Active hostilities continue in the east and south of Ukraine. Our Armed Forces retain the initiative. Today I want to commend the fighters of the 25th separate airborne brigade for their skillful and thoughtful actions in destroying the enemy in the eastern direction. I am also thankful to the warriors of the 60th separate infantry brigade, whose units are showing good results in the Kherson region. Only since the beginning of October, the fighters of this brigade \"trophied\" more than 30 units of Russian armored vehicles, a thousand projectiles for tanks and three \"Giatsint\" cannons. All these weapons will definitely help liberate our land. I am also grateful to the fighters of the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade named after Yakov Handziuk. This week, the boys showed excellent results in destroying enemy equipment and ammunition. I also thank the warriors of the 35th separate marine brigade named after Rear-Admiral Mykhailo Ostrohradskyi for their steadfastness in the defense of the regained frontiers. And one more thing. Today, the government made an important decision that affects tens of thousands of Ukrainian students. Those whose home is in the temporarily occupied territory or in the areas near the front, as well as children of fallen defenders of Ukraine, family members of combatants. All of them will be transferred from the contractual form of education to the budgetary one in our universities and colleges. Details of this decision should be made public by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine. I thank everyone who fights and works for our country! Thank you to everyone who brings Ukraine's victory closer! Glory to our best people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! We continue eliminating the aftermath of today's terrorist attacks on our infrastructure. The geography of this new massive strike is very wide: Volyn, Odesa, Khmelnytsky region, Kirovohrad region, Dnipropetrovsk region, Rivne region, Mykolaiv region, Zaporizhia region and other places. The main target of terrorists is energy. Therefore, please be even more careful than before about the need to consciously consume electricity. The stability of the power industry of our entire state depends on each city and district of Ukraine. Please limit the use of appliances that use a lot of electricity. And especially during peak consumption hours in the morning and in the evening. Please, pay attention to notices from local authorities and power companies about when there may be stabilization blackouts on your street or in your area. Plan your day with this information in mind. In part of the territory of our country, where electricity was cut off due to today's strike, it has already been possible to restore power supply. Electricity supply has already been resumed partly in Odesa region, partly in Khmelnytsky region, most of Rivne region has resumed power supplies. There are positive reports from other regions as well. But in many cities, in many districts, recovery work is still ongoing. We are trying to return power to people as soon as possible. I want to thank everyone who is involved in this work: energy workers, utility and local government workers, government officials and businesses that also help. Together, we are now showing that Ukrainian life cannot be broken. Even if the enemy can leave us temporarily without power, it will still never succeed in leaving us without the desire to make things right, to mend and return them to normal. And even now – partially in the dark – life in our state, in our Ukraine, is still civilized. Unlike Russia that brings us this terror. They still have the same wildness with electricity there, as in ancient times. Only savages can bring such evil to the world. I want to emphasize: neither this strike by terrorists nor any other similar strikes by them will stop our defenders. Russian propagandists are lying when they say that this terror against our infrastructure and people can somehow slow down the active actions of our military or create some difficulties for our defense. Ukrainians are united and know for sure that Russia has no chance of winning this war. Our defense forces are getting everything they need to defend the country and are pushing forward every day – I emphasize: every day. Our Air Force also shows good results. Of course, we do not yet have the technical ability to shoot down 100% of Russian missiles and attack drones. We will gradually come to this – with the help of our partners, I'm confident of this. But we are already shooting down most of the cruise missiles, most of the drones. Only in the first half of this day, 20 missiles were shot down – Kalibr and Kh-101 missiles, as well as more than 10 Iranian Shahed UAVs. Today, I want to once again thank our soldiers – fighter pilots and anti-aircraft gunners of the West, South and Center air commands, as well as mobile fire groups of all the Defense Forces for the saved lives of our people and the preserved infrastructure of Ukraine. We are preparing the ground for extending the global sanctions policy to all Russian propagandists, so-called opinion leaders and show business representatives who support or justify terror. The International Working Group on Sanctions Against Russia, chaired by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak, has prepared an Individual Sanctions Roadmap. It prepared a basic list of all those involved in the spread of narratives without which Russian terror is impossible. We must clearly evaluate such an \"informational and emotional\" component of terror: the Russian army loses and retreats on the battlefield, and therefore the results of terror against our civilian population and infrastructure are presented by Russian propaganda as a substitute for military victories. Also, various Russian newsmen and stars are involved in justifying the criminal attempt to annex our territory and mobilize for war against us, against Ukraine. Absolutely all such persons should receive a full package of individual sanctions so that they cannot do anything in the world at all. We are working on it. Ukraine was very well represented this week in Frankfurt at the largest book fair in Europe and one of the largest in the world. This is not just an event for the publishing business and writers. It is one of the key European discussion platforms and an influential informational event. The First Lady of Ukraine presented her projects supporting education and the cultural sphere there. In particular, the Books Without Borders initiative is to provide children of our forced migrants with books in the Ukrainian language. And also the Ukrainian Bookshelf project, which is already presented in 20 countries of the world. In total, more than 40 Ukrainian publishing houses, famous writers, famous publicists, and historians took part in the Frankfurt fair. I thank everyone who worked in Frankfurt for making Ukraine heard and bringing the message about it there. Every contribution to the world's support for Ukraine is vitally important. I thank everyone who works and helps for our victory! Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to our indomitable people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we can already report that in all our regions, which became the target of yesterday's Russian terrorist attack, the technical possibility of electricity supply has been restored. I am thankful to each and every one who worked tirelessly to bring light to people. Of course, in many cities and districts, our energy companies have to apply stabilization shutdown schedules. This is done so that all our people have access to energy - in conditions where it is not possible to produce it in sufficient quantities. Restoring energy facilities destroyed by terrorist attacks is a much longer and more difficult task. But over time, we will provide that, too. Over time... This time must be passed. Therefore, today and in the future, as before, we should consume electricity very consciously. Please remember to limit the use of unnecessary and energy-consuming appliances. Separately, I want to address community leaders and mayors of our cities: please make sure that energy is not wasted. Now is definitely not the time for bright shop windows and signs. It is necessary to be really frugal with energy consumption in public space. Reconstruction continues in the de-occupied territory. Every day I receive new reports about the connection to gas, water, electricity of hundreds of households in liberated areas. In particular, just today in only two districts of the Kharkiv region, 346 households have gas again. The city of Vovchansk - 750 more households with electricity. The city of Izyum - 300 more households with electricity. This is constant work that does not stop for a single day and continues throughout the liberated territory of Ukraine. Wherever Russia has brought death and degradation, we are restoring normal life. This is precisely about Ukrainians. Where Ukraine is, life is never destroyed. But wherever Russia comes, it leaves behind mass graves, torture chambers, destroyed cities and villages, mined land, destroyed infrastructure and natural disasters. So when today the Russian Minister of Defense organizes a phone carousel and calls foreign ministers with stories about the so-called \"dirty\" nuclear bomb, everyone understands everything well. Understands who is the source of everything dirty that can be imagined in this war. It was Russia who blackmailed with the radiation disaster at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. This is the trajectory of Russian missiles that goes, in particular, over Ukrainian nuclear facilities. Those are Russian troops who mined the dam and aggregates of the Kakhovka HPP and are blackmailing with their detonation. It is Russia that uses phosphorous munitions, banned anti-personnel mines and the entire range of weapons against civilian infrastructure. Ukraine is always about recovery. Always about life. And there’s only one subject who can use nuclear weapons in our part of Europe, and this subject is the one who ordered comrade Shoigu to call somewhere. If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this. I believe that now the world should react in the toughest possible way. If Russia has prepared another round of raising stakes and another escalating step, it must see now, preemptively and before its any new \"dirt\" that the world will not swallow that. Even the very Russian threat of nuclear weapons - and even more so against our country, which has given up its nuclear arsenal under promises of security from the largest nuclear powers - is a reason for both sanctions and even greater strengthening of support for Ukraine. Because the stronger the support for us is, the sooner this war and any possible Russian threats will end. When a terrorist state raises the stakes, it must feel that it won't work. During the upcoming week, this will be the number one task for our diplomats - to explain what is happening. And I am sure: the world will be with us. The world will understand. It is very important that today the sixth ship with food chartered in the framework of the UN World Food Programme left our port. This vessel is bound for Yemen, with wheat. Ethiopia, Yemen and Afghanistan are three countries that have already received food thanks to our exports and the UN food program. Such programs are exactly what we in Ukraine are thinking about. How to help get out of the crisis - not how to create a crisis. How to help solve a problem - not how to drive someone into a problem. How to restore the destroyed - not to destroy even more. This is what distinguishes Ukraine from Russia. This is what will help us win in the end. Because we fight and work for life. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! People of Israel! I am recording this address to you after the regular meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The Staff is the highest body in Ukraine, which provides collegial management of the defense of our state. The military, intelligence, heads of special services and law enforcement agencies, the speaker of the parliament, ministers and other top officials - everyone whom the protection of Ukraine depends on, participate in these meetings. It is in this format that we adopt key defense decisions. We listen to the reports about hostilities and the development of our defense operations, about threats to national security. And it is there, at the Staff, that the words that are constantly heard in Israel when you talk about the survival of your state are heard more and more often. These words are Iran, Iranian. Each time they mean something that you all fully understand. They mean a mortal threat. I will give you just one example now. It happened on October 17, when Russia carried out another terrorist attack. That day there were 15 Russian cruise missiles and 42 Iranian combat drones in the sky of Ukraine. Power plants, other critical infrastructure facilities, and even residential buildings became targets. One of these residential buildings is in Kyiv. After an Iranian drone strike, half of the building is gone. Four floors were destroyed - from the basement to the roof. It stood for 120 years. It was built by Ioselian Lev, an entrepreneur at the time, the head of one of the synagogues. The building withstood World War I, waves of terror and World War II. It saw so much and was destroyed by an Iranian drone. Like many, many other objects in Ukraine. Five people died that terrible day. Well... actually, six. A drone killed a young family who lived in one of the apartments of that building in Kyiv - a boy and a girl, the girl was preparing to become a mother. Ukraine is now constantly subjected to such Russian terrorist attacks. The disgusting sound of Iranian drones is heard in our skies every night. In general, according to our intelligence, Russia ordered about two thousand \"Shaheds\" from Iran - one type of Iranian terrorist weapon. And also missiles and other drones. Iranian instructors came to teach Russians how to use drones. How did this alliance of theirs become possible? I will tell you. Russia loses to us in a real confrontation on the battlefield. Putin's army does not know how to fight. We beat it on our land in such a way that it is forced to withdraw its contingents even from other regions that it tried to destabilize. Pay attention - the Russian presence in Syria has been significantly reduced thanks to our defenders, who are beating the occupiers. But, unfortunately, we do not have our own \"Iron Dome\". We still do not have a modern and effective air defense and missile defense system that could secure our skies. That is why Russia hopes to use terror in the air to compensate for losses on the ground. Russia strikes with missiles like the S-300. It uses them to hit Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and other cities. Every day and every night. To burn cities - house by house, street by street. Where it cannot reach with these missiles, Russia hits with \"Kalibrs\" and anti-ship Kh-101. Kyiv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro... It destroys energy, transport, food warehouses, shopping centers, and social infrastructure with them. In 8 months of full-scale war, Russia has used almost 4,500 missiles against us. And their stock of missiles is dwindling. That is why Russia went looking for affordable weapons in other countries to continue terror. It found them in Iran. I have a question for you - how does Russia pay Iran for this, in your opinion? Is Iran just interested in money? Probably not money at all, but Russian assistance to the Iranian nuclear program. Probably, this is exactly the meaning of their alliance. And this alliance of theirs simply would not have happened if your politicians had made only one decision at the time. The decision we asked for. Every time we in Ukraine, at the meetings of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, discuss Russian missile and drone terror, we also talk about our partners who already help or can help us protect the sky. Unfortunately, the words - Israel, Israeli - do not sound at that moment. Of course, this is the decision of your state, your Governments. It seems that it was adopted a long time ago - in 2014, when Russia began its aggression against Ukraine. The decision \"not to annoy\" the Kremlin, not to help Ukraine for real. I emphasize - we have been asking Israel for help since 2014. But such is the continuance of politicians. Although if we had immediately secured our skies when faced with a missile and drone threat, Russia would not even have a motive now to go to Iran and offer it something in exchange for assistance in terror. But that's what happened. And I think that this alliance of theirs can still be rendered meaningless. If we act together, with you, in the same way as with other democracies. Ladies and Gentlemen! Russian officials and propagandists are really frank. They hate that we live freely and protect our culture. They even try not to say the word Ukraine. They want us all dead. The other day, even one of the famous Russian propagandists absolutely openly called to burn Ukrainian children simply in the houses where they live, or to drown them in rivers - as soon as the children say that they are Ukrainians. This is what rashism is. Iran helps rashism by getting something for itself. Many democratic countries help us. But we would also like to get your help. Of course, we will not give up our struggle no matter what. We want simple and clear things: to liberate our land, to guarantee the safety of our people, to give peace to Ukrainians. We will continue our defense and, I am sure, we will defend Ukraine and our freedom. Our common freedom - of all democratic countries. I sincerely thank you for the award with which you honored this struggle of ours. But isn't it time for your state to choose who you are with as well? Is it with the democratic world, which is fighting side by side against the existential threat to its existence? Or with those who turn a blind eye to Russian terror even when the cost of continued terror is the complete destruction of global security? I believe that you will give fair answers to my questions. Because these questions, in fact, are not about politics, but about values. About the values that still unite us. They unite us even when we do not agree on politics. I thank the people of Israel for the understanding and help, in particular, medical aid that we received from your society! I am grateful to you and all the Israeli media that spread the truth about this war and condemn Russian terror! I am thankful to all of your people who took to the streets after the start of the full-scale war, and we saw - we are supported in the Promised Land. I believe that we will see support in the sky as well. Thank you for your attention and I wish you all peace and victory! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Strong people of our indomitable country! Today is exactly 8 months of full-scale war. What has been achieved over this time? We have defended the independence of our state - and Russia cannot change that already. We are liberating the Ukrainian land step by step. Donbas, Kharkiv region, Kherson region are now heard. But Zaporizhzhia region and Crimea will be heard as well - the time will come and all of Ukraine will be free. Ukraine is breaking the so-called \"second army of the world\" - and from now on, Russia will only be a beggar. They are begging for something in Iran, they are trying to squeeze something out of Western countries making up various nonsense about Ukraine, intimidating, deceiving... Never again will Russia be a subject that can dictate something to someone. It no longer has the potential to dictate. The world sees that. Russian potential is being wasted now on this madness - on a war against our state and the entire free world. There was gas influence - not anymore. There was military influence - it is evaporating. There was political weight - now there is an increasing isolation. There were ideological ambitions - now there’s only disgust. And this is a very important change in the configuration in our part of Eurasia - the more of its potential Russia loses now, the more real freedom all peoples will get both next to Russia and within its borders. Ukraine - first of all. On February 24, the Kremlin could not even think about it, although they should have. But now, on October 24, there is no Russian official or propagandist who does not understand where all this is going for them. They started to recall 1917 long ago. The feeling of failure in Russia is getting stronger. But, realizing all this, we have no right to relax. We still have to go the way to Ukrainian victory. This is a difficult path. We’ll have to pass this winter, which will be the most difficult in our history. To do the necessary part of the work in autumn, winter and spring in order to get the desired results for the state. To maintain the maximum mobilization of our partners for the sake of the struggle for freedom and not allow our common enemy to split the global pro-democracy coalition. This is what we do, all Ukrainians, Europeans, all people of the world who value freedom. I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. We help the active actions of our warriors on the frontline, provide them with everything they need, strengthen the protection of infrastructure facilities, and establish defense against missile and drone threats. The military, intelligence, and government representatives delivered reports. Separately and in great detail, we are dealing with the system of territorial defense. I addressed the people of Israel today in the framework of the Conference on Democracy, organized by Haaretz newspaper. This is a very important media - the oldest newspaper in Israel. There I presented the Ukrainian point of view on the rapprochement between Russia and Iran, on why this rapprochement became possible and what threats it poses to our peoples. I called on Israel to join other democratic countries that already support Ukraine. We are preparing for very important events tomorrow. The first is the parliamentary summit of the Crimea Platform. Dozens of partner states, hundreds of politicians and public figures. This will be another step in our preparation for the de-occupation of Crimea. The second event is a summit in Germany dedicated to the reconstruction of Ukraine. We are doing everything to get the necessary resources for the restoration of our country right now, for the development of the social and economic sphere right now. And I sincerely thank all our partners who support Ukraine in this work. And one more thing. Today the world celebrates United Nations Day. It was on this day in 1945 that the UN Charter entered into force. It was not written and adopted as something ritualistic - it is not an empty formality. It is one of the basic documents that should work to maintain peace and international legal order. It should work. And it will work. In particular, we are achieving this through our struggle against illegal and unprovoked Russian armed aggression. Everyone who tries to restore peace for Ukraine is also fighting for peace and security to be possible for all other peoples on earth. And I want to thank Mr. António Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, for our cooperation, for the fact that he truly defends the Charter of the United Nations and global peace. We have already achieved good results together - this is the release of our prisoners who were held in Russia, this is the grain export initiative, which makes it possible to alleviate the acuteness of the food crisis in the world, this is multifaceted cooperation in UN structures. Thanks for all your help with this! And I believe that we can achieve even more. Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Eternal glory to our warriors! Eternal glory to our strong people! Eternal gratitude to our friends! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good afternoon, dear friends! I congratulate you on behalf of the Ukrainian people! And thank you for this conference, which brings the return of normal life to our country closer. I have now heard the speech of Mr. Chancellor and I have also heard Distinguished Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen. And then I looked at my speech and realized that we could have exchanged speeches and nothing would have changed. And that's not bad. This means that we see the future of Europe, security, the world, and the future of Ukraine in approximately the same way. But I would like to dwell on some priorities. First of all, I would like to note your words, Mr. Chancellor, which were spoken yesterday. You said that whoever invests in the restoration of Ukraine invests in a future member of the European Union. These are very important words. Significant ones. I believe that they will be heard by all Europeans and global economic players. Your words fully reflect the meaning of our conference and the entire cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union, our country and your countries. We become one - and this is irreversible. A united, strong, free and values-based Europe. Peaceful Europe! This is possible only with Ukraine. I would also like to immediately thank you, Mrs. President of the European Commission, for your sincere and consistent support of our country. I know that you, Mrs. Ursula, share this opinion of Mr. Chancellor regarding the future membership of Ukraine. And I am sure that together with you and all our friends in the European Union, we will soon realize the vision of the majority of Europeans - the vast majority in all EU countries. The vision of Ukraine as part of the EU. Now we have reached the level in relations that Ukraine has long deserved. The importance and scale of our country is being realized. People know what we can give to our common European home. People see what we already give. And all of you - participants of the Conference - know very well what we can give. Ukraine is the physical security of Europe against any new attack of Russian tyranny. It is Ukraine that can guarantee and will guarantee that Russian revanchism will not break our European home. Ukraine is the energy security of Europe - and not only of our neighbors. When we free our entire territory from Russian invaders, the European Union will be able to replace dirty Russian energy resources with our help. And our export of electricity – potentially tens of gigawatts – will be one of the fundamental pillars of European climate policy. Ukraine is already a guarantor of world food security. And therefore, we also guarantee the predictability of migrant flows to the territory of the European Union. The more efficient our agricultural production is and the more important our food exports are, the calmer the social situation is in all those regions of the planet from which waves of migrants to Europe are possible. And one more thing is industrial activity. Our industrial culture, our natural resources, geographical location, and social traditions allow us to give a new impetus to the economic life of the entire EU thanks to the combination of Ukrainian and pan-European potentials. This is economic growth and jobs - for Ukrainians and for all Europeans. You know all this one hundred percent. And you know that this is exactly why Russia needs control over Ukraine. This is not just some political ambition. These are very clear security, energy, food, industrial calculations. Calculations that will not come true for Russia. Never. The Ukrainian people will defend their state, their freedom. And the invaders are already aware of this. This is one of the reasons for their beastly cruelty. One of the motives of their terror is to destroy something that will not work for them, but can strengthen all of us - Ukrainians, Europeans. As a result of such Russian terror, hundreds of thousands of objects were destroyed. A port or a train station, a school or a hospital, a residential building or a car service station, a factory or a bakery, a grain elevator or a power plant... Russia destroys all of this. Destroys to make it harder for us to endure this winter. So that Ukrainians could not recover from this war for as long as possible. So that you will not be able to integrate the Ukrainian economic potential and the pan-European potential for as long as possible. Missiles and Iranian combat drones have destroyed more than a third of the energy industry alone... And this is before winter! We must stand together against it. This is how I perceive the mission of this conference. And I urge you to consider all this from the point of view of security - its four elements. We need security on land. We work for it together, establishing defense cooperation. We need security in the sky. And we work for it, negotiating the supply of air defense systems. We need financial security and we work for it at many levels - the IMF, the World Bank, the European Union, the United States and other partners. And the fourth level is our institutional capacity. The way we implement all our reinforcement programs and reconstruction programs now, while the war is still going on, and those designed for the post-war period. And I urge you now to focus not only on the fourth element - “how”. But remember the third element as well - “what”. We need to fill our work with real funding - for the sake of restoring Ukraine. I thank you - the European Union as a whole and each EU country in particular that helps - for the support already provided to our state. However, we should give this support a more systemic character. I believe that we can now adopt a decision on the establishment of a \"financial Ramstein\" to maintain our common stability - by analogy with the \"defense Ramstein\" which is already functioning. We need a financial coordination platform that will unite and direct all the efforts aimed at rebuilding our country after hostilities. Consolidation is needed - clear and timely direction of resources. This is exactly how what we talked about in Lugano with President Cassis - at the first conference on our recovery - must continue. We have developed a transparent plan of priority steps in reconstruction - this is what Ukraine literally needs to survive. Not tomorrow, not next year. Not at a conference in Britain... Right now! The weight of our Fast Recovery Plan is $17 billion for critical immediate reconstruction. These are hospitals, schools, vital transport and energy infrastructure. We have a huge need for housing reconstruction. Where Russian tanks and artillery methodically destroyed cities... Kyiv region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Kharkiv region... It is necessary to give people a new foundation for life already now. But can we give it? We have not yet received a single cent for the implementation of the Fast Recovery! I urge you to bring the necessary decisions closer. In order to speed up the process of involving partners in our reconstruction, I initiated the creation of the Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine. As a key institution. It is important that 75% of the Fund's supervisory board will consist of representatives of donor countries. This is transparency, but this is also responsibility. The fund is to start working next month. Likewise, now - already at this Conference - it is necessary to adopt a decision on assistance to cover the deficit of our state budget next year. For Ukraine, this is an unsustainable amount - a deficit of 38 billion dollars. These are salaries of teachers, doctors, social benefits, pensions. Significant funds. But our association is powerful enough to implement such a task as well. This potential is available. This potential exists in particular thanks to the International Monetary Fund and other financial institutions. Our dialogue continues. And I believe that it will develop from abstract numbers to specifics. A specific amount of funding, with specific sources. This should also be discussed today. Especially since the Ukrainian potential is such that we can give much more in return! This is what Russia is fighting for, this is what reconstruction means for Ukraine, this is what victory means for Ukraine and this is what peace in Ukraine means. Ukraine is a guarantee of security. Ukraine is our joint development. Ukraine is gratitude. When our actions meet our values and our approaches are coordinated, we achieve results that were unimaginable until recently. We have such results on the battlefield. We have such results in economic and social adaptation to war conditions. We have such results in our integration with the institutions of the European Union. And we can achieve them in ensuring the stability of Ukraine and in the reconstruction of Ukraine - already now. Let the aggressor see that his goal is unattainable. And all our common goals are realized. And of course - we must decide on the specifics of how the mechanism of compensation by the aggressor state for all losses caused by this war will work. Russian assets - those that have already been frozen, and those that still need to be frozen, are significant. A significant part of these assets is in the jurisdictions of European countries. We need compensation - and this is fair. And therefore, we need a real, fast, legal mechanism for directing Russian assets to compensate for the losses caused by the Russian war. I urge you to devote time to this issue today as well. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! I thank you for participating in the first parliamentary summit of the Crimea Platform! I am grateful to our Croatian friends for hosting, thank you, Ruslan, for a strong start! Thank you all for your kind words about Ukraine and the Ukrainian Crimea, where we will definitely meet again - very soon, I'm sure of it. At the summit of the Crimea Platform, which will mean the restoration of peace on our continent. Peace is what brought us together. What we value. What we strive for and what we cooperate for in different formats and at different levels. Peace… What we all lost in 2014 when Russia started its insane aggression. Started with Crimea. After more than eight years of Putin's war, there are no countries left in the world that would not feel its consequences. It affected everyone - in one way or another. The world is counting losses. What did the Russian enslavement of Crimea lead to, if you look at it from the present day? It was a prologue to a full-scale war that would take the lives of thousands and thousands of people. It was the birth of an anti-human system that tortures, deprives of freedom and injures men, women and children without distinction of age, sex, religion or ethnicity. This was the beginning of the most dangerous chaos in international relations over the lifetime of several generations. All of this was brought by the Russian flag to Crimea and all this is spreading further to the world from the occupied Crimea. The world has become a much more violent place. A place where Russia easily provokes a large-scale famine, as due to its criminal control over Crimea, it has destroyed the freedom of navigation in the Black Sea and can at any moment block our food exports - vital for the world market. The world has become a place where Russia easily and with impunity destroys hopes for stability, for example, in the Middle East and North Africa, because it keeps Crimea as a strategic military base for criminal interference in the situation in these regions. The world has become a place where Russian nuclear blackmail is, unfortunately, commonplace, because this state, in order to keep the stolen territory, threatens the entire humanity with catastrophe. The Russian leadership is trying very hard to show that all this is from 2014 and forever. But that is why we are together so that the brutality and chaos brought by Russia will be truly temporary. Temporary, like the Russian occupation of Crimea. It all started with it. Its return will mean the restoration of true peace. Because the Russian potential for aggression will be completely destroyed when the Ukrainian flag will be back in its rightful place - in the cities and villages of Crimea. Crimea must be freed from its use by Russia as a bridgehead. Then the world will feel that there will be no more losses. And people will feel that the world is becoming safer. Two years ago, when we founded the Crimea Platform, we envisioned a constant expansion of its format. And I'm very happy to see the platform develop in this way. First there was the level of the leaders of the states. Now - the level of legislators and government officials, public figures and experts. And this second level is no less powerful than the initial one. As it makes it possible to attract the democratic power of our societies to respond to each of the challenges that have already been provoked by the Russian occupation of Crimea and that will inevitably arise when it is returned to the legal control of Ukraine. Modern active generations do not yet have the experience of returning such a special territory from the invader to its native state. After all, the ninth year of Russian enslavement continues... The ninth year of Russia's destruction of the entire international law, all normal economic, social and cultural ties for Crimea. This is what it is now. Crimea is separated by Russia from the very possibility of a normal life. On the territory of Crimea, the occupiers not only committed thousands of crimes... Since 2014, Crimea is the only part of Europe where de facto purges continue - on religious and ethnic grounds. If you are a Muslim, the Russian occupiers consider you guilty. If you are a qırımlı, the Russian occupiers consider you guilty. If you have a Ukrainian passport, the Russian occupiers consider you guilty. Think about it again: people have been living in such conditions for the ninth year already! And also there is constant Russian militarization of Crimea. And also there is constant deliberate destruction of the Crimean nature by the occupiers. And also there is total lack of guarantees of property rights in Crimea and the looting of Crimea in the interests of the invaders. It will not be easy to reintegrate Crimea after years of such occupation. But due to cooperation, we will manage to ensure this as well. We will change the situation completely. The return of the Ukrainian flag to Crimea is the return of the normality familiar to all Europeans, as it is available in each of your countries. Security normality, economic, legal, social, cultural. The return of the Ukrainian flag is the arrival of the European Union on the peninsula. In the full sense of these words. All levels of our integration: trade - this is a huge market, investment - these are huge opportunities for development. All this is simply not available in Crimea now. And it cannot be available - Russia has deprived our peninsula of markets and development. The return of the Ukrainian flag is the protection of human rights, it is freedom for all people in Crimea, for all communities - ethnic or religious. It is an opportunity to freely speak your mind and spread the truth about what is happening. It is available everywhere on our continent - from the Atlantic to the Kharkiv region. And it will be available in Crimea. We are already getting closer - every day. And I have just taken part in the work of the Berlin conference on the recovery of Ukraine. Already now, when the war is still going on, and the recovery after our victory. The restoration of our Crimea is being discussed along with the restoration of the whole of Ukraine as an integral part of the valuable, infrastructural, investment and cultural space of the whole of Europe. And we need three things now. At this time, when the restoration of our territorial integrity is still ongoing, sufficient and timely support for our state is needed. Defense, financial and sanctions. I urge you to advocate such support for Ukraine, to constantly strengthen it - it is the foundation of future peace. Then, when we reach our legal state borders and return Crimea in particular, we will need your experience: security, political, legal, economic, social, infrastructural. In order to return full life to Crimea after years of occupation, and justice to the people of Crimea, our cooperation must be maintained at a maximum even after the restoration of our territorial integrity. We should make this format of ours, the format of the Crimea Platform, a starting point for other humanitarian and diplomatic platforms that will promote the de-occupation of other territories that were once enslaved: from Transnistria and Abkhazia to the northern territories. And the third... This is very important. I ask you to promise me that you will definitely visit our Ukrainian Crimea, liberated from the occupiers and peaceful. As soon as we return our national flag there. This part of Europe has been waiting for distinguished guests for too long. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Thanks again to Croatia as the host country for our summit. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister Plenković - I am glad to see and hear you - and Mr. Speaker Jandroković for your hospitality. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we had a very active diplomatic day, events for Ukraine at all levels - the highest, governmental, parliamentary. In the morning, I addressed the participants of the Berlin conference, which is dedicated to the reconstruction and modernization of our country. This is already the second such conference, after the Swiss one, which took place in the city of Lugano. We are working to obtain resources for the rapid restoration of our infrastructure, social facilities, and housing for Ukrainians. I am grateful to German Chancellor Scholz and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for making today's event in Berlin very meaningful. We are waiting for specific decisions. Time cannot be stopped, and winter is coming. The Crimea Platform started working in Croatia today - at the parliamentary level. This is an additional and very powerful level of functioning of our instrument for the deoccupation and reintegration of Crimea. The Parliament always embodies democracy, represents different communities of each country. Therefore, when parliaments help restore territorial integrity, when, thanks to parliamentary cooperation, expert work and exchange of experience can be directed in the right direction, it is very powerful. We will definitely liberate Crimea. We will return this part of our country not only to the all-Ukrainian space, but also to the all-European space. This was confirmed once again today. And I am grateful to all our partners - almost 50 states and international organizations - who help in the parliamentary format. I am also grateful to Croatia separately for the hospitality towards our Crimea Platform. Today I held a meeting with representatives of the Jewish community – American, European and, of course, Israeli. We talked primarily about the protection of our people, about the need to make Russian terror impossible and to end this war as soon as possible by guaranteeing complete security and freedom for all Ukrainians throughout the territory of Ukraine. The sooner peace is achieved on our land thanks to the Ukrainian victory, the less evil Russia will bring to other regions, including the Middle East in its cooperation with Iran. I believe that one day Israeli politicians will hear this position, as Israeli society has already done - we feel it. The protection of historical memory in Ukraine was discussed separately. Despite the war, we must continue to implement our programs that restore historical justice. We started the implementation of an important project commemorating the victims of Nazism - the construction of a memorial in Babyn Yar. We will definitely complete it. I held extremely meaningful negotiations with the President of Germany, who arrived in Ukraine. Today, President Steinmeier visited the Chernihiv region - the districts that were under occupation. While he was there an air alert started. And actually the Russian missile terror, the enemy's use of Iranian drones was one of the key topics at our negotiations. We are deeply grateful to Germany for the modern and effective air defense system already provided to us. We are looking forward to new similar systems. We discussed the entire range of our cooperation - defense, political, financial. Significant attention was paid to reconstruction - and I am grateful to President Steinmeier for his willingness to personally patronize this work. We will enhance cooperation with Germany in the field of reconstruction. And at the local government level, it will also receive presidential patronage. And one more thing. Just before recording this address, I spoke with new British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. I believe that the partnership between our countries and the already traditional British leadership in the defense of democracy and freedom will be further strengthened. Ukraine and Britain have achieved the best relations so far, but there is still potential to increase our cooperation to bring more benefits to our societies. I invited the Prime Minister to visit Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who helps us fight for freedom! I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for our victory! I am grateful to all our warriors who are now holding their positions, destroying the occupiers and giving Ukraine the most important feeling: a feeling of confidence in our future. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today I held a big meeting on the energy situation. The participants were government officials, the Office, energy companies, and the State Emergency Service. The topics were diverse. It was recovery of damaged objects, protection of generation, ensuring people's access to energy. The state of nuclear and hydrogen generation was analyzed separately, as well as the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Russian terrorists have created such difficult conditions for our energy workers that no one in Europe has ever seen or encountered. There were no such threats that our specialists are forced to overcome now. And they overcome them with honor. I thank all the workers in the energy sector, our rescuers, repair crews, representatives of local governments, private companies who work efficiently enough to maintain the stability of our energy system despite all threats. In many cities and regions of Ukraine, emergency blackouts happen, power consumption has to be limited. But we all have to remember one thing: we need victory over Russia in the energy sphere as well. No matter what the enemy does, our task is to break its plans and protect Ukraine. And this is not just someone's task, it concerns not only energy workers or anyone else. Conscious energy consumption is now needed by all Ukrainians. Please choose your own scheme for limiting electricity consumption while there is a shortage in the general power system. The situation on the front line has not undergone significant changes. The fiercest battles are in Donetsk region: Bakhmut direction, Avdiyivka. The craziness of the Russian command is now most visible there: day after day for months, they drive people there to death, concentrate the maximum power of artillery strikes there. All our soldiers who hold positions in these directions in Donetsk region are simply heroes. Active actions in other directions continue. Today I would like to mention the soldiers of the 25th Airborne Brigade for their bravery in liberating the occupied territories in Luhansk region. In general, we are strengthening our positions everywhere at the front, reducing the capabilities of the occupiers, destroying their logistics and preparing good news for Ukraine. Today, during the day, the air raid alerts sounded several times over most of the territory of our state. The Air Force has results – another helicopter of the occupiers was shot down, another drone. By the way, the total number of downed Russian helicopters is already approaching 250. The Russian occupiers have already lost as much equipment – aircraft and other – as most of the world's armies simply do not have and will never have in service. Russia will not be able to recover these losses. I thank all our fighters for such a gradual and irreversible demilitarization of the enemy. We continue to do everything possible to free our people from Russian captivity. Today, we can finally announce the release of ten more Ukrainians. Our exchange team is working around the clock. And I want to emphasize once again that any of our front-line units can speed up exchanges by capturing the occupiers. The more Russian soldiers are in our exchange fund, the sooner we will return Ukrainians home from Russia. The President of Guinea-Bissau visited Kyiv today. He also chairs the Economic Community of West African Countries. In fact, he is a representative of 15 African countries that are part of this community. And this is the first African leader who visited our country after February 24. In general, we are consistently expanding our contacts with Africa, filling them with new content. Many negotiations and agreements are taking place for the first time in our history. It is very important that on this continent, where the Kremlin's influence is traditionally significant, they hear the Ukrainian position and know the full truth about what is really happening. We provide it. We also work every day to protect our grain export initiative. It is obvious that Russia intends to exacerbate the global food crisis again, to bring back the threat of large-scale famine. And this, in particular, is the responsibility of all our partners – after all, to guarantee food security and end this dirty Russian game with hunger. Today, due to deliberate Russian inhibition of our food exports, the number of ships waiting for the opportunity to meet contractual obligations is already 175. And this is not just some trade problem. This is the deterioration of access to food for millions of people and the threat of an even greater increase in the prices of essential products on different continents – both in Africa, and in Asia, and in Europe. If, after all, Russia succeeds in the negative scenario, it will end in a new large-scale migration crisis. Russia as a terrorist state is a terrorist in everything and deserves daily increasing international pressure on it. I am grateful to those leaders and those politicians who understand and ensure this. I am grateful, in particular, to the Senate of Poland, which decided to officially recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. And such decisions should be adopted by the majority of the countries of the world – Russia itself, by its actions, leaves no alternative. I thank everyone who helps us fight against Russian terror! Glory to all who fight and work for the freedom of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good evening, warriors of light! Energetic people who are always ready to fight! Its 246th day is coming to an end. We continue our resistance. The aggressor continues his terror. We are again attacked from the sky by a flock of their crows. More than 30 drones were launched in two days. The defenders of our sky prevented the enemy's vultures from breaking into the rear of the country and downed 23 Shaheds. In addition, the Kh-59 guided air missile, two Ka-52 attack helicopters and another Su-25 attack aircraft were turned into scrap metal. In total, during this period, Russia carried out 4,500 missile strikes and more than 8,000 air raids. But we are fighting, we will shoot down more. I thank the guardians of our sky. I am grateful to everyone who participated in the fundraising for the \"catchers\" of such \"Shaheds\". Only on the U24 platform those are 665,000 people from 70 countries. Together, we will certainly clip the wings of all metal monsters, no matter how many of them and from where they fly in the direction of Ukraine. Enemy planes will fall. Enemy helicopters will fall. \"Shaheds\" will fall. It is only the Ukrainian people who will not fall! A heroic people who will definitely go down in world history. Actually, like this day. It is already history. It's already midnight on the clock. October 28 is already on the calendar. Every year on this day, we celebrate the liberation of Ukraine from the Nazi occupiers. We pay tribute to the Ukrainians who fought and defeated Nazism during World War II. Today we do it, holding not flowers in our hands, but weapons. Today, preserving the memory of the exploits of our ancestors means protecting their achievements. We remember the expulsion of the Nazis, approaching the expulsion of the Rashists. Evil, which seemed to have been finally defeated and burned to the ground in 1945, is reborn from the ashes 80 years later. Gets on its feet. It becomes possible. How did it turn out? Imperceptibly. And very quickly. Just as one day changes another. Instantly. A new day and a new evil are coming instantly. At the very moment when the world does not notice. Some are sleepy, some are fast asleep. Some are not paying attention. Some do not care. And in general, everyone is silent and thinks the same: I will not be affected. The war is somewhere far away. Somewhere in Transnistria. This is the problem of Moldovans. Somewhere in Abkhazia and Ossetia. This is the problem of Georgians. Somewhere in Crimea and Donbas. This is the problem of Ukrainians. We will not be affected. It will not cause damage to us. They will not come for us. Unfortunately, as a result, it becomes everyone's problem. Sooner or later, memories of a terrible war become a terrible reality. The neighbor becomes the aggressor. The aggressor becomes a terrorist. And Nazism becomes an example to follow. It may come in a new guise, with new slogans, but with the same goal. Unfortunately, it is not from books that we know about it. We know how evil can break into your house in the last century, eight years ago and eight months ago. Violate the western borders or come from the north, east and annexed Crimea. Attack peaceful cities with bombs or cruise missiles. Mine the Dnipro HPP or seize the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Drop bombs despite the red cross or the \"Children\" inscription. Steal grain according to the \"Hunger Plan\" or threaten the entire planet with hunger. Abduct and deport people. Abduct and deport children. The form of evil has changed, but the essence has remained unchanged. Evil always begins in the same way. The invaders call themselves liberators. The invasion of one's army is called self-defense. As 80 years ago, the Ukrainian people stand up for the defense of their native land. And the enemy's blitzkrieg plan becomes a failure. Evil always acts in the same way. Kills civilians, assuring that it hits military targets only. Arranges blockades and filtration camps. And Syrets becomes Olenivka. Destroys cities and villages. And Koryukivka becomes Bucha. But sooner or later war crimes become known. The reaction of the world becomes painful. The policy of appeasement becomes a tough countermeasure. The evil finds itself in a zugzwang. So evil always ends the same way. The occupier becomes a capitulator. The invader becomes a fugitive. War criminals become defendants, aggression becomes a sentence. Destruction becomes reparations. Enemy equipment becomes museum exhibits. The feats of grandfathers become the victories of grandchildren. The day of the liberation of Ukraine from the Nazis on the 247th day of our struggle becomes a symbol: the result of our struggle definitely becomes the liberation of our Ukraine. The captured territory becomes free. This has always been the case in the past, and will certainly be the case in the future. In the future of Kherson, Donbas, Luhansk, Crimea. Because our land always becomes free. Resistance becomes pride. Struggle becomes victory. And Ukraine becomes united! Today, Russia's only tactic has become terror. Defeat is the only possible outcome of such tactics. Terror became a proof of their weakness and a test of our resilience. We will not be broken by shelling. The enemy's rockets in our sky are less scarier than hearing the enemy's anthem on our land. We are not afraid of the dark. The darkest times for us are not without light, but without freedom. Our warriors are strong, volunteers are tireless, partners are reliable, and people are indomitable. The second army of the world will become smaller and smaller. The losses of the enemy will become bigger and bigger. I am confident that enemy propaganda does not work, provocations do not work, threats do not scare. Any hard winter will not scare us as well. We know that the darkest night comes before dawn. We know that all invaders flee our land in the same way. Gauleiters and self-appointed \"governors\" end up the same. Reichskommissariats and quasi-republics die equally. And all our cities will definitely have our flags. Both Junkers and kamikaze drones fall equally. And in our sky there will definitely be our birds, our blue sky, our \"Mriya\"! Glory to all who fought against Nazism during World War II! Glory to all who are fighting for Ukraine today! Glory to our people who will go down in history! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I’ve just finished speaking with the students and educational staff of Yale University, one of the leading universities in the US and the world. Its graduates have a significant influence on decision-making - political, business, at the level of public and international organizations. It is with appeals like this to representatives of Yale University that we expand the circle of those who understand what is happening in Ukraine and help us protect freedom. I will continue this work next week. We will continue to expand our capabilities, in particular through informal diplomacy - through the public in partner countries, through the student community, through professional and business communities. I held talks today with Giorgia Meloni, head of the Italian government. I congratulated Mrs. Prime Minister on her appointment, and discussed opportunities for strengthening our cooperation in various areas, including security, economy, diplomacy, and in particular, the integration of our country into European and Euro-Atlantic structures. I held several meetings with the military regarding the current situation on the frontline, our active actions. Today the enemy reports about the alleged completion of their mobilization... About the alleged needlessness of new waves of sending Russian citizens to the front. We feel completely different on the frontline. Although Russia is trying to increase the pressure on our positions by using mobilized people, they are so poorly prepared and equipped, so ruthlessly used by the command that it allows us to suggest that Russia may soon need a new wave of sending people to war. We are preparing for this - we are preparing for the fact that the current Russian leadership will look for any new opportunities to continue the war. In particular thanks to its accomplices in Iran. That is why we are working with our partners every day to strengthen our air defense, our other defense capabilities. Every day we strengthen the protection of our critical infrastructure, primarily energy. As of this time, many cities and regions of our country use stabilization blackout schedules - about 4 million Ukrainians face restrictions now. Kyiv and the region, Zhytomyr region, Poltava region, Rivne region, Kharkiv region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Cherkasy region, Kirovohrad region. Emergency blackouts are also possible in other regions. We are doing everything so that the state has the opportunity to reduce such blackouts. The occupiers added another challenge - in the occupied territory. Virtually, they are dismantling the entire healthcare system there. The occupiers have decided to close medical institutions in the cities, take away equipment, ambulances - just everything... They put pressure on the doctors who still remained in the occupied areas for them to move to the territory of Russia. First of all, this concerns the Kherson region. Russia is turning the Kherson region into a zone without civilization, without elementary things available in most countries of the world. Before the arrival of Russia, this region, like all other regions of Ukraine, was completely normal and safe, all social services for people were guaranteed there... Life was guaranteed there. And now Russia is trying to make the Kherson region literally an exclusion zone. The world must react to this. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all our representatives inform international organizations and partners about this new escalating step of the occupiers. And I want to appeal now to all our people in these occupied cities and districts: please do everything to help each other - despite any actions of the occupiers. The Ukrainian flag will return. We will return normal life. But you need to endure this time. The time when even formally the occupiers confirm that they cannot stay on the territory of Ukraine, and therefore they already try to steal medical equipment and enslave medical personnel. I thank the United States of America - another package of military aid to Ukraine was announced today. Its volume is 275 million dollars. Much needed items for our defenders that allow us to liberate our territory step by step. It's not just what helps us advance on the battlefield, it's what enables us to guarantee people their fundamental right to life. Today I want to thank Canada - our long-standing and sincere partners. For an unprecedented act regarding the issue of Canada's sovereign bonds, all funds from the placement of which will be directed to help Ukraine. The amount is half a billion dollars. And these bonds will be available for investment not only in Canada, but also around the world. This is an extremely powerful example for all our partners. Canada is the first country to offer such a support tool. Thank you, Justin, Mr. Prime Minister! Thank you, Chrystia Freeland, a true friend of Ukraine! Glory to all who help Ukraine fight for freedom! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you so much to everybody for the support! Thank you for the honor of addressing you today. Dear Mr. Rector! Dear Senators! I also know you well. Thank you for being with us, supporting us in Kyiv. Thank you to the honorable professorial team and students! Dear friends! I am glad to welcome you all and thank you for your attention to Ukraine! I watched this video, a beautiful video made with heart and soul. Beautiful, but at the same time very tragic. You have seen everything and there is nothing to talk about. I think we will be able to discuss and assess this and the details in the questions and answers part of our discussion. However, I also have a short video. I think it will be helpful too. We still have a question-and-answer session ahead of us, so I will try not to waste a lot of time so that as many people as possible can express their thoughts today. You probably all know what is happening in Ukraine and what a brutal war Russia is waging against us. Tough and cruel. By the way, thanks to the fact that Professor Timothy Snyder works at your university - a very remarkable individual, an outstanding historian – you can easily find out absolutely all the details about why Russia acts in the way it does and why it started acting like that from Ukraine. I will describe the situation in general. For Russia, this is a war not only to seize our land. And not only for breaking our independent statehood, spreading its imperial influence. It's a bit more. With its terror, Russia is trying to destroy what is constantly reborn in our people despite the wars that have taken place, despite the invaders who came here, and even despite the Kremlin's policy of genocide against Ukrainians, which was implemented in the 20th century. And one of its manifestations was, in particular, the Holodomor – the destruction of people by artificially organized hunger. Ukrainians went through very terrible things and still preserved their ability not to obey, their love of freedom and inner confidence that the source of any power on earth is the people. Not a royal throne, not power, not wealth, but people. And it is very important that Ukraine has the potential to protect this fundamental democratic spirit. Protect not only for itself, but also for other peoples in our part of the world. This is where the front line is. And not only for Ukraine! It's the royal throne against freedom. The army is made up of those who have been deprived of any freedom during the years of the rule of this Russian leadership, against the defense forces made up of those who know for sure that everyone's freedom makes everyone stronger. Look even at how we differ on the battlefield in Ukraine now. For us, this is a people's war for freedom, and each of the Ukrainian military units has guardian angels in the rear – people who help with everything that may be necessary for our soldiers. We constantly feel this direct connection between the defense forces and society. Do you see something similar in Russia? It is not there. Their people feel a direct connection except with television propaganda of hatred. Our commanders on the battlefield have the freedom to make their own decisions in general defense operations and use that freedom to decide how to operate more effectively at one point or another. Instead, Russian commanders tremble, waiting for orders from above from those who have never seen a battlefield in their lives, and sometimes spend months trying to fulfill orders that are hopeless from the start, simply wasting people's lives, sending them to their deaths, wave after wave. Our defense forces are immediately followed by sappers, rescuers, repair crews, energy workers and all those who have to restore normal life to people. And what does the Russian flag bring to the land where it was erected? Mass graves, torture camps, deportations, filtration camps and total looting. Imagine: Russian occupiers remove Ukrainian books from libraries and destroy them. Everything that can remind of Ukraine is being destroyed in schools as well. Already 51 Ukrainian universities have been hit by Russian missiles and artillery! At checkpoints and infiltration camps, Russian soldiers force people to undress to reveal whether they have Ukrainian patriotic tattoos. Even the simple presence of Ukrainian national symbols on the body or, for example, a yellow-blue ribbon on a backpack is a sufficient reason for the Russian military to detain, torture or kill a person. And thousands of such cases have been recorded. Why is this happening? Because Ukrainian is a target for Russia. Russia is fighting against freedom, destroying Ukrainian and Ukrainians. This is exactly how they see it in the Kremlin – the destruction of the people, and therefore of freedom. They do not believe that it is possible to conquer Ukraine in any other way. And that is why, for example, they went to Iran for weapons, for killer drones and missiles, because Russia lacks its own means of terror, and it simply does not have anything else in its plans or thoughts. Take a look at what the Iranian drones purchased by Russia are sent. They are sent against what enables the people to live: against power plants, boiler houses, transport, even houses. They want to destroy everything Ukrainian, they hate the entire Ukraine – our every manifestation. And this is precisely the strategic threat of Russian aggression. Because according to Ukrainianness, Russia will go to destroy Polish or Georgian life in the same way – that is, the life of other nations on a huge territory – from the countries of Northern Europe to Kazakhstan. And that is why we say that it is important for the whole world that Russia loses now – in the war in Ukraine. When we win for ourselves, we will win for other nations whose freedom is potentially under attack: the ambitions of the Russian throne are known. And so that all this does not sound too general, I ask you to watch one video. Video about what we will save Ukraine and other nations of our part of the world from, when we expel the Russian invaders from Ukraine and achieve security guarantees for all of us. ...This was a picture of our survival under Russian terrorist attacks only during October. And this full-scale war has been going on for nine months. Dear friends! On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I want to thank your people for the support you provide to our defense. Thank you to your leaders – President Biden, both chambers and parties of Congress, public figures and businesses who feel how important it is for Ukrainian democracy to endure. I am sure Russia has no chance of winning this war and destroying us and any other nation in our part of the world. But the sooner we stop Russia, the more certain our cooperation will be. The more Russian threats, the more our cooperation should be. And the more Russian escalating steps, the more our steps should be in response to defend freedom and people. We cannot slow down the momentum in cooperation and give Russia even the slightest hope that its terror can work. Right now, and precisely in Ukraine, it is being decided whether our part of the world will be free and democratic. Ultimately, this is how the global fate of democracy will be determined. This fate should be determined by you and us – the free world, not Russia and its accomplices. I believe that it will be so! Thanks again for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today we managed to return another 52 people from Russian captivity: 50 of our defenders and two civilians. Among them are soldiers of the National Guard, the Navy, border guards, security forces... Andriy Albov is the head of the surgical department of the Mariupol military hospital, he was evacuated from Azovstal. Vasyl Chalenko is a volunteer, security guard, commander of the reconnaissance platoon. Among these 52 are a sailor from Snake Iceland, as well as a National Guardsman who was taken prisoner while defending the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, and a pensioner who earlier worked in the SBU and who was taken prisoner by the occupiers in Bucha. We remember all those held captive in Russia and in the occupied territory, and will do everything to return each and every one. Our exchange team is always working. These are Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Lubinets and others who help. In total, since March, 1,031 people have already been released from Russian captivity. Thanks to the whole team for this result! I would like to once again commend the work of our energy workers, repairmen, and regional administrations. All those who are working to restore the normal technical possibility of electricity supply after the Russian terrorist attacks. Today, there are significantly fewer stabilization and emergency blackouts – much less. But there is still such a need, and in some cities and districts restrictions are still possible. In particular, it is Kirovohrad region and some other regions. We do everything to make power outages as predictable as possible and so that people can plan their day. Special thanks to those who worked and are working to restore energy supply to the city of Uman and the Uman district of Cherkasy region. There was indeed a difficult situation after one of the Russian strikes. As of now, it is possible to return the technical possibility of power supply. The same situation is in Kyiv region: it was critical, but we are now changing it for the better. I want to emphasize: the return of the technical possibility of supply does not mean that the energy shortage in the system has been overcome. Russian terror continues. It is very cynical. Sometimes it repeatedly attacks deliberately when repairs have begun, when recovery work is in progress. Unfortunately, we have casualties in repair crews, in energy companies. My condolences to their families. Therefore, please – this applies to all Ukrainians – it is very important to be conscious of electricity consumption. This necessity persists. Now we all have to contribute to maintaining the stability of the entire power system. During the week – from Saturday to Saturday – more than 40 Iranian strike drones, a significant number of Russian missiles, six attack helicopters of the occupiers, several of their planes were shot down... Such a result means hundreds of Ukrainian lives saved, dozens of critical infrastructure objects saved. And as proposed by the military command, today I want to especially note the Odesa and Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades of the Air Force. Well done, guys! I also thank all our defenders of the sky, absolutely everyone – all anti-aircraft fighters, pilots, mobile fire groups, who are currently performing one of the most important strategic tasks – saving the country from airstrikes by terrorists. Today, a rather predictable statement came from Russia – a statement that they are finally canceling the grain export initiative. But in fact, this is not their decision today. Russia began deliberately aggravating the food crisis back in September, when it blocked the movement of ships with our food. From September to today, 176 vessels have already accumulated in the grain corridor, which cannot follow their route. Some grain carriers have been waiting for more than three weeks. This is an absolutely deliberate blockade by Russia. This is an absolutely transparent intention of Russia to return the threat of large-scale famine to Africa and Asia. Literally today, more than 2 million tonnes of food are in the sea. This means that access to food has actually worsened for more than 7 million consumers. Algeria, Egypt, Yemen, Bangladesh, Vietnam, others countries – very different countries, from different parts of the world... But they can all be equally destabilized by this Russian decision to block exports. I emphasize: this decision was made by Russia apparently in September. Only this queue of ships with food at sea can testify to this. It is also important that Russia attacked our Naval Forces at least twice during the grain initiative. Precisely by those forces that guarantee the safety of the grain corridor. A strong international response is needed now. Both at the UN level and at other levels. In particular, at the level of the G20. How can Russia be among the G20 if it is deliberately working for starvation on several continents? This is nonsense. Russia has no place in the G20. All partners see this artificial queue of vessels. They see what Russia did to disrupt the grain initiative. They see that even ships with grain, which are contracted within the framework of the UN Food Program for the poorest countries, do not get a guaranteed opportunity to pass through the sea route. Russia is doing everything to ensure that millions of Africans, millions of residents of the Middle East and South Asia find themselves in conditions of artificial famine or at least a severe price crisis. But why a handful of people somewhere in the Kremlin can decide whether people in Egypt or Bangladesh will have food on their tables? What is it? The world has the power to protect people against this. Ukraine has been and can continue to be one of the guarantors of global food security. Russian terror and blackmail must lose. Humanity must win. I thank everyone who is fighting with us to restore peace and stability to international relations! I thank everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today - the 27th since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia. Key defense issues were considered: our active actions on the frontline, further liberation of the territory from occupation, supply of ammunition and equipment, repair of equipment, other support for the defense forces, as well as preparations for winter. Of course, the plans of the Russian military were also considered. The Commander-in-Chief, head of intelligence, commanders of operational directions, ministers delivered reports. Every day and without any breaks, we work to speed up the restoration of the territorial integrity of our state. And always at the meeting of the Staff we celebrate the successes of our warriors, the result ensured in the liberation of Ukrainian land. Every time we have reasons to rejoice together with all Ukrainians. Following this week, I would like to celebrate the warriors of the 54th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa, the 5th Separate Assault Regiment and the 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade for their bravery and steadfastness while holding the lines in the Siversk direction, as well as the warriors of the 25th Sicheslav Separate Airborne Brigade for determination during the liberation of our territory, for special energy. Thank you, warriors! The warriors - border guards of the Chop detachment, who are currently protecting our state in the Donetsk region as part of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, showed themselves perfectly. Today, they stopped the enemy's brutal assault - the Russian attack was repulsed. In addition, they managed to replenish our exchange fund. Thanks guys! The Air Forces also have a result: today there is a downed Russian attack helicopter and a downed Russian aircraft - Su-25. Russian terrorists continued shelling in various directions: Chernihiv region, Kharkiv region, Donbas, Dnipropetrovsk region, Zaporizhzhia and the region, Mykolaiv and the region... We respond to the occupiers. We respond tangibly. In general, there were no emergency blackouts throughout the country today - we managed to restore the technical possibility of energy supply after the Russian strikes that took place during the week. But generation deficits still persist, so extremely frugal electricity consumption and stabilization restrictions must be continued. And please be especially careful on the roads at night. There have already been many appeals, in particular from the National Police, regarding the need for pedestrians to have reflective elements on their clothing. This is very important for both children and adults. But it is no less important that drivers have a conscientious attitude. Now you should not just follow the speed regime, but also reduce the speed additionally, especially in those places where there are unregulated pedestrian crossings. Please take care of the safety of others. And, by the way, today I want to congratulate all Ukrainian motorists - not only civilians, but also military - on the Day of Motorists and Road Workers. Usually they wish you a good road. And I know that this road of ours, although not easy, definitely leads to our joint victory. Congratulations! Another vessel chartered by the UN Food Program has already been loaded in the port of Chornomorsk. This is a bulk carrier carrying 40,000 tons of wheat for Ethiopia, a country experiencing a severe food situation. Ethiopia is on the brink of famine. This is a problem not only of rising food prices, but also of a physical shortage of food. We are ready to release this vessel into the sea, like all others that left the ports of the Great Odesa during the grain export initiative. But this bulker with wheat for the UN Food Program and other vessels with agricultural products are forced to wait, because Russia is blackmailing the world with hunger. What did the world hear? That someone allegedly launches drones from a bulker... At first they talked about \"war birds\", then - \"war insects\", now - \"war grain\"... A killer wheat, which drowns Russian admirals. Well, what can you say? They are truly sick people. But these sick people are once again putting the world on the brink of a severe food crisis. Russia is the only one to blame for the fact that food will now become more expensive for people across a vast expanse from West Africa to East Asia. Russia is the reason why people, in particular, in Ethiopia, Yemen or Somalia, are left with a catastrophic food shortage. Of course, the partners are trying to convince the terrorist state to slow down the blackmail a little. But is it realistic? So far, the facts indicate that the Russian leadership is more interested in exacerbating the food crisis than in implementing the signed documents. And this, by the way, is the answer to all those who talk about negotiations with Russia. The grain corridor is a very specific example. There are now 218 pieces of evidence that Russia does not want any real deals. 218 vessels waiting for the opportunity to carry food under export contracts or enter Ukrainian ports. Week after week, Russia has been slowing down the grain corridor despite its own promises to partners, and has now blocked it completely. Ukraine, for its part, will do everything to ensure that the grain export initiative continues to work. And I thank everyone who helps our state! Thank you to everyone who fights and works for our victory! Thank you to everyone who shows concern for others under these circumstances! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear defenders of the law and human rights! Greetings to all of you – participants of the International Bar Association meeting and thank you for your attention to the Ukrainian struggle for freedom. This year, your Association celebrated its 75th anniversary. It was on February 17 - a week before the terrible Russian invasion of Ukraine, which undermines the long-term achievements of humanity in the protection of international law and order and peace. This ongoing war in Ukraine has long had echoes in all other parts of the world. Somewhere there are waves of refugees. Somewhere there is a threat of large-scale famine due to the artificial food crisis provoked by Russia. Somewhere there is a brutal cost-of-living crisis that drives millions of people into poverty and destroys the well-being of the middle class even where Russia cannot reach with its aggression. And somewhere there are the toughest possible things. This is happening in Ukraine. Artillery shelling of our cities - hundreds of Ukrainian cities were destroyed, dozens - completely burned. Constant missile and bomb terror. Iranian combat drones that Russia is using against our infrastructure. Millions of Ukrainians suffered losses from this war unleashed by Russia - they lost loved ones, friends, their homes. At least tens of thousands of Ukrainians have already been killed. Of course, we are doing everything to protect our people and oust the Russian invaders from Ukrainian land as soon as possible. We are doing everything to restore freedom to all Ukrainians in all corners of our country. And I believe that we will do it - thanks to our heroic defenders, thanks to everyone who fights and works for the victory of Ukraine. Very powerful assistance is provided by our partners - and I am especially grateful to the United States of America for its leadership in the global coalition formed this year to protect Ukraine and freedom. But I would like to draw attention to the fact that lawyers will put an end to this war - after the military, after politicians. Exactly lawyers. Those who will ensure that all those guilty of terror are brought to justice and that all damages caused by Russia are compensated - at the expense of the assets of the aggressor state itself. It is this kind of justice that should be the end of the evil that Russia has brought. Behind every of four and a half thousand Russian missiles there are people who are responsible for the deaths and losses that those missiles have caused. Behind every mass burial of the victims of Russian torturers, there are savages who are guilty of these murders. Behind every manifestation of Russian aggression there are those who planned it, organized it, justified it and prevented its termination. We have already started working to establish a Special Tribunal to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. This tribunal will happen. We are already cooperating with the United States, with European countries, with the International Criminal Court to punish all Russian murderers and torturers. We have already started the creation of the Compensation Mechanism, which will ensure the confiscation and channeling of Russian assets to compensate for the losses caused by this war. And I invite you to join this work! This is an opportunity for each of you to help people who have become innocent victims of war as specifically as possible. This is a chance for each of you to become part of the multi-generational global effort to establish the force of international law. Perhaps, right now in this hall, among you, there are those whose names will soon be inscribed in the world history of the protection of freedom and law and order - for all people, for all countries, for all times. I thank you for the already started cooperation of your Association with the Ukrainian Office of the Prosecutor General and for your initiatives that help us fight for justice for all the victims of this Russian terrorist war. I urge you to be active in the future! Together we can prove that the law is effective, that the law works, that every war crime will be investigated, and every war criminal will be brought to justice. Thank you for your attention! Long live freedom and let justice prevail! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Currently, restoration work is still ongoing in those regions where Russian missiles hit today. We are doing everything possible to restore energy and water supply. And we will restore it. Russian terrorists do not have such missiles that could hit the Ukrainian desire to live, live in a civilized manner and take care of each other. And if someone over there in the Kremlin listened to their crazy propagandists and decided that the darkness in Ukraine would help put pressure on Ukrainians, then let them not be surprised at their losses when they see how Ukrainians conduct \"negotiations\" in the dark. Today our Air Forces and everyone involved in protecting the skies did a great job. Most of the objects that the terrorists identified as targets were saved. This morning alone, the terrorists used 55 cruise missiles for a massive strike, 45 of which were shot down. I thank all Air Forces Commands for this result: South, North, East and West, as well as all units of the Defense Forces involved in protecting our skies. Plus, four more Russian helicopters were shot down today: three attack Ka-52 and one Mi-8. Of course, we will continue to strengthen our air defense. But already now, for every ten hits, terrorists have to spend at least four times more missiles. Russia has an even worse result with regard to drones, including those supplied by its Iranian accomplices. And the world sees that. It sees that the former \"2nd army of the world\" is no longer even the 22nd in terms of its effectiveness. And we will do everything to make it into the second hundred. And it will be so. I would like to especially mention the units and employees of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, who both last week and today eliminated the consequences of terrorist attacks. They worked even despite the threat of repeated strikes and extinguished dozens of fires. A big gratitude to all energy workers, utility workers, local self-government, regional administrations - to each and every one who restores normal life. The same gratitude to those of our people who, each at their own level, guarantee that there will definitely be a response to the terrorists. There will be a response on the battlefield. And I want to remind you that the total level of personnel losses of the Russian occupiers is almost 72,000. There will be a response to terrorists in international relations as well. Complete international isolation of the terrorist state is just a matter of time. There will be a response in the area of criminal responsibility - everyone involved in Russian terror, everyone who organized, carried out and justified it, will be responsible for it before the international court. Every new Russian attack on our civilian targets only makes the international consensus on Russia's liability easier and closer. And the fragments of the Russian rocket that fell on the territory of Moldova only remind us how important it is to protect ourselves from this evil together - from rashism, which recognizes neither state borders nor human values. Today, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic visited Ukraine - one of our greatest friends. The Czech Republic currently holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and this is how Russia treats European structures: during the visit of the Czech representative - 55 cruise missiles. However, no matter what they think in Moscow, Ukraine takes care of itself and does its own thing. Today, we signed a special declaration with the Prime Minister regarding the Euro-Atlantic integration of our country. The Czech Republic has confirmed that it will support Ukraine's membership in NATO. The declaration also contains specific directions of our cooperation for the implementation of NATO standards in Ukraine. We are starting the work on signing such declarations with all members of the Alliance. I had a call with German Chancellor Scholz. I thanked him for the provided IRIS-T air defense system, and informed about the results achieved by the German system. We discussed the possibilities of increasing German support for Ukraine, in particular in the restoration of our infrastructure after terrorist attacks. I also spoke with UN Secretary-General António Guterres. I informed him about the new level of escalation due to Russian actions. Terror against Ukrainian energy facilities, moreover against the background of Russia's attempts to exacerbate the global food crisis, clearly indicates that Russia will continue to oppose itself to the entire international community. And if so, Russia should have no place in the UN Security Council and all other international structures. I am grateful to both Mr. Scholz and Mr. Guterres for supporting our actions aimed at preserving the grain export initiative and preventing the spread of large-scale famine in some regions of the world. It is very important now to prevent this global destabilization that Russia seeks. And we can prevent it. Today I signed three decrees on awarding our warriors. A total of 406 warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine received state awards. I would like to separately thank the warriors of the units of the National Guard of Ukraine, who perform tasks in the Donetsk region. They perform them accurately and efficiently. They skillfully defend their positions and put significant pressure on the rashists. Thank you for this, guys! Thank you to all those who make Russia get used to the idea that neither the army, nor terror, nor anything else will help them conquer Ukraine! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to our fantastic people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I continued our diplomatic activity so that the world reacts strongly to another Russian escalation, to the terror against our energy facilities, and to Russia's attempt to exacerbate the food crisis again. I had a call with French President Emmanuel Macron. I thanked him for the support already provided and informed him about our urgent needs, primarily in defense. There must be an air shield for Ukraine. Today it was clearly said. We discussed with Emmanuel very specific projects both to strengthen our defense and to rebuild the destroyed facilities. The bet of terrorists for the winter is completely transparent to everyone, and this challenge should be viewed precisely as a challenge to all of Europe. Moscow will present any winter difficulties in its propaganda as alleged proof of the failure of a united Europe. Therefore, together we must prove to the terrorists that failure is a word about them, not about Europe. We agreed to hold two very important events. The first is in December in France. The subject covers all the challenges of winter: from energy to finance, from weapons to protecting the sky. And the second event is to convene the business of France and help Ukraine. We talked with President Macron about the situation with our food exports. These days, the movement of ships with Ukrainian agricultural products has continued, primarily thanks to the principles of the partners, namely the UN and Türkiye, which do not accept Russian efforts to destroy the grain agreement. But the grain corridor needs reliable and long-term protection. Russia should clearly know that it will receive a tough response from the world to any steps that disrupt our food exports. This is literally a matter of life for tens of millions of people. In particular, I talked about this with the Prime Minister of Cambodia today. This country now holds the presidency of ASEAN, one of the most powerful world associations. That's more than 600 million people in ten countries. And for each of these countries, the food crisis is a real threat to national security. If food prices rise due to Russian aggression, if there is a deficit in the food market, this will inevitably lead to catastrophic consequences in most ASEAN countries, as well as in other regions of the world. Therefore, pressure on Russia for the sake of guarantees of food security is now needed from everyone - and from Asian countries as well. We work for this. European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson visited Kyiv today. She helped us a lot in the process of Ukraine’s accession to the pan-European power grid. This is what significantly strengthened Ukraine. And now we heard the necessary signals of support from the European Commissioner. We discussed the initiative to create such a format, which, like a military \"Ramstein\", will work for the sake of our common security, but precisely in the energy sphere. Something like an \"energy Ramstein\" - funds, technical support, transformers, generators, energy carriers - this is what is vitally necessary for our defense. Assistance to specific cities and communities was also discussed. Such as Mykolaiv, Nikopol, Kharkiv and others, which are subjected to constant Russian terror - literally every day and every night. I informed the European Commissioner about the liquidation of the consequences of yesterday's massive Russian attack on our energy sector. About our needs due to such strikes. As a result of the visit, we have many working agreements. As of now, we can report that the technical possibility of water supply has already been restored for all consumers in Ukraine. For most, it is also technically possible to supply electricity. Stabilizing blackouts continue in nine regions of Ukraine. Energy workers and local authorities are doing everything to reduce the time of blackouts. It should not be forgotten that restoration work continues without a break in the territories that were liberated from the occupiers: in the Kharkiv region, in Donbas, in the south of the country. For example, gas supply has already been restored for more than 20,000 consumers in liberated areas of the Kharkiv region. Heat supply systems are being restored in Vovchansk, Balakliya and other cities. We will do everything to give people electricity and heat this winter. But we must understand that Russia will do everything to destroy the normality of life. They do not care about the cost of energy terror. If you look at the cost of yesterday's Russian attack alone, the missiles and drones used cost Russia the equivalent of more than 2,300,000 average Russian old-age pensions. And that's one attack! Monthly incomes of 2,300,000 Russian pensioners... Instead of overcoming poverty in their country, the Russian leadership spends everything to avoid admitting a historical mistake they made with this war against Ukraine. They are hopeless on the battlefield. Ukrainian warriors have already proved it. But it takes time, it takes effort, it takes patience to prove that even the hope for winter will not come true for Russian terrorists. I'm sure we'll get through it. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! Glory to each and every one who works to bring our victory closer! Glory to all our warriors who are holding their positions, no matter how difficult it may be, and are gradually liberating our land! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today, we have a significant diplomatic outcome for our country and the whole world – the Grain Export Initiative will continue being implemented. Russian blackmail has led nowhere. The UN and Secretary General Guterres personally responded in a principled and effective way. The President of Türkiye, Erdoğan, also participated. Other key international actors also made timely and fair steps. Once again, everyone saw that there is only one threat to global food security in our region, and that is the Russian Federation, and no one else. This entire situation was immediately reflected in the stock exchanges' indicators – we see some decrease in the price of both wheat and corn. Every time Russian blackmail intensifies, food prices rise. And every time the world does not give in to blackmail, foodstuffs become cheaper. And if there was no Russian attack on Ukraine, there wouldn't even be a phantom threat of the global food crisis. Because every Russian missile that hits our ports, grain storage facilities, and power plants that power our agricultural production ultimately affects the standard of living of tens of millions of people in many countries. This includes Egypt, Algeria, Somalia, Sudan, Lebanon, Bangladesh, India, China, Indonesia, Vietnam... This year they overpaid tens of billions of dollars for food – and only because of Russia, only because of crazy Russian aggression that destabilizes international trade. Today, I spoke with President Erdoğan, in particular, about the security of the grain corridor and the Black Sea in general, about the work of the Crimea Platform, about the return of Ukrainian prisoners of war and political prisoners – we remember each and every one who is in captivity, we will release everyone. We also talked in detail about constant Russian provocations, about Iranian drones, about missile strikes by the Russian army. For example, this morning a Russian plane launched cruise missiles near Snake Island, and they actually flew over the grain corridor routes. And every such Russian launch – and they are almost daily – directly threatens food exports. And it is the partners' responsibility to work together to reduce the Russian threat. I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. The agenda of the meeting is quite obvious. This is the situation on the front lines, in particular in Donetsk region, where the fiercest fighting is going on. By the way, I want to commend the fighters of the 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade and the 79th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade for their steadfastness in repelling enemy attacks right there, in Donetsk region. It is especially difficult there these days – dozens of Russian attacks every day. Our guys are standing firm and not giving up a centimeter. This is true heroism. And I thank everyone who defends our Donetsk region! Of course, we also discussed the situation in other areas at the meeting: Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, the south of the country, the situation on our borders. We are strengthening our positions everywhere and working towards the key goal – the complete liberation of the entire Ukrainian land. I held talks with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain – he was in Ukraine today. I thanked Spain for the new defense aid package for our country. We discussed what could further strengthen our defense. In particular, we are working together with Spain to really provide an air shield for Ukraine. And it is very nice that today famous and talented historian Timothy Snyder became the new ambassador of our charity platform UNITED24. His name is well known in Ukraine. He is one of those who consistently defends the historical truth about Ukrainians and explains to the world why Ukraine is important. Now that Mr. Snyder has joined the fundraising effort to strengthen our anti-drone defense, he will focus on the Shahed Hunter project. I am sure that when we together provide Ukraine with reliable protection against this partnership – the Russian and Iranian regimes – it will be one of the strongest pages of our state history. And one more thing I would like to pay attention to. You probably heard today that the Kremlin is saying that they demanded security guarantees from Ukraine. We should think for a moment about their statements. Two hundred fifty two days ago Russia demanded security guarantees from the United States of America. After eight months of Russia's so-called \"special operation,\" the Kremlin is demanding security guarantees from Ukraine. These are really striking changes. This shows both the failure of Russian aggression and how strong you and I are when we remain united. Millions of Ukrainian men and women who fight and work for our freedom. And millions of people around the world who help us resist Russian terror. Together we will ensure the defeat of the terrorist state and its punishment for terror. And we guarantee that all of Ukraine is and will be free. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! First of all, I want to congratulate you on two professional holidays that are celebrated today. This is the Day of Missile Troops and Artillery and the Day of Engineering Troops. I sincerely congratulate all warriors, veterans and relatives of our heroes who serve in these troops. Ukrainian artillery became the strongest in Europe and one of the strongest in the world. It will always be like that. Despite the physical advantage of enemy artillery - simply quantitative - our warriors provide better results. The advantage of our gunners is qualitative - skills, intelligence, faith in themselves and in our country. And I signed the decrees on awarding two brigades with a special award - \"For courage and bravery\". These are the 43rd separate artillery brigade named after Hetman Taras Triasylo and the 44th separate artillery brigade named after Hetman Danylo Apostol. Thank you guys for your precision! Ukrainian engineering troops are exactly those warriors who make a vital contribution to the advancement of our units, and therefore to the liberation of our territory. They create a material basis for the movement of troops and for the protection of positions - barricades, crossings, demining and much more. I thank all units of these two branches of the troops, each soldier, relatives of our soldiers and all those who support them and who help them. Today, there were various negotiations and meetings to strengthen our state. The visit of the President of Greece took place, and the key meaning of the visit is precisely defensive. We received from Greece the first batch of armored vehicles, which are extremely necessary now. Defense cooperation, strengthening of sanctions against Russia, creation of a special tribunal on the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine were discussed. Of course, we also talked about the reconstruction of Ukraine. All this is a special topic for Greece. The community of Ukrainian Greeks traditionally lives in the south of our country, in many cities and villages, a large part of which was badly damaged by Russian strikes. Many Greeks lived in Mariupol, in the Mariupol area... I hope that Greece will actively support our efforts to bring all Russian murderers and torturers to justice for what they have done against our people. And when we return the Ukrainian flag to all the cities and villages of the south of our country, we will certainly invite Greece, its companies and specialists to participate in the restoration of normal life in this part of Ukraine. Today I also met with representatives of the US Congress - Senators Chris Coons and Rob Portman. I thanked them for the continued bipartisan support and for the assistance that the United States provides to our country. We talked primarily about an air shield for Ukraine, about how to speed up the liberation of our territory. Challenges in the energy sector were discussed separately and in a very specific manner. Russian attacks on our energy sector, on our energy facilities, do not stop for a single day. Kryvyi Rih was attacked by Iranian drones this night. Such Russian terror must receive - and surely will eventually receive - a powerful global response. I am grateful to our friends in the United States who are helping with this. In general, there is damage to energy facilities in different areas across the country - this is the volume of electricity generation and transportation for millions of people. Only as of this evening, about 4.5 million consumers have been temporarily disconnected from consumption under emergency and stabilization schedules. In particular, in Kyiv and ten regions: Kyiv region, Dnipropetrovsk region, Zhytomyr region, Zaporizhzhia region, Sumy region, Kirovohrad region, Kharkiv region, Chernihiv region, Khmelnytskyi region, Cherkasy region. Blackouts may take place in other regions as well. To endure Russian energy terror and such a challenge is our national task, one of the main ones now. The very fact that Russia resorted to terror against the energy industry shows the weakness of the enemy. They cannot defeat Ukraine on the battlefield, and that is why they are trying to break our people in this way - to humiliate Ukrainians, to strike at the morale of our people, at the resistance of our people. I believe that Russia will not succeed. It is important now to preserve our ability to act together. Therefore, today I want to draw attention to two things. The first is the attention of local authorities. Please ensure that there is no unnecessary use of electricity in all cities and communities of Ukraine. Now is definitely not the time for bright showcases, signs, advertisements and other such lighting. I also appeal to the energy companies - publicly, so that everyone can hear it. Please be more active in explaining to people when and why you disconnect this or that street, this or that district. Now is the time for such microcommunications. People have a right to know. And if consumers contact and report this or that injustice in energy supply, please respond to it immediately. Work together with local authorities. If someone stays without electricity for eight or ten hours, and everything is connected, including street lighting, across the street, then this is definitely unfair. It is necessary to do everything so that disconnections are predictable and completely understandable for consumers. In particular, I spoke today with the President of Moldova about energy challenges. The terrible consequences of Russian hybrid aggression are felt by all Europeans, and the citizens of Moldova as well. We talked with Mrs. Sandu about what we can do together in the interests of our people and for the protection of our states. I also spoke with the President of Indonesia today. The topic is clear - this is the G20 summit, which will begin shortly. This is our effort to prevent a food crisis. And I thank Mr. President for his support in this matter, for his positive assessment of our efforts. There is a conclusion of the IAEA today - it is quite obvious. The organization's mission visited all the objects that Russian representatives mentioned when they told their fantasies about the so-called dirty bomb. We have invited the IAEA to check, we have given them full freedom of action at the relevant facilities, and we have clear and irrefutable evidence that no one in Ukraine has created or is creating any \"dirty bombs\". And the only thing that is dirty in our region now is the heads of those in Moscow who, unfortunately, seized control of the Russian state and are terrorizing Ukraine and the whole world. The important document was prepared and published today by an international group of experts working under the leadership of Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak. This is a document about absolutely necessary sanctions against Russia in the IT sphere. This is what can really weaken the potential of Russian aggressiveness. IT is used for missile and drone terror, for the production of military equipment, for cyber attacks and the spread of disinformation. That is, it is one of the pillars of the Russian war against Ukraine and freedom in the whole world. We offer a concrete way to break this Russian IT pillar. I am sure that we will complete this task as well - there will definitely be corresponding new sanctions against Russia. And the last point. Today, another 107 Ukrainians were freed from Russian captivity. Six of them are officers, 101 are sergeants and privates. Army, Navy, territorial defense, National Guard, border guards... Many of them were wounded, and very seriously. Everyone is already getting the aid they need. I am sincerely glad that another 107 families have seen their loved ones, and I thank all our team who made this exchange possible: intelligence, the Office, the Security Service, the ombudsman. We will definitely return home all Ukrainian men and women who are in captivity in Russia or in the temporarily occupied territory. We remember each of our heroes. Glory to all who defend our state! Glory to all who fight and work, bringing our victory closer! As for the front, the guys are moving forward. As for the grain, the ships are on their way. As for the occupiers, they are also on their way... following the warships! Glory to Ukraine!"

For us, the railway is transport, as it has always been, the provision of defense, the supply of everything necessary for society, and the production of defense structures. In the afternoon, I congratulated the workers of Ukrzaliznytsia, presented state awards. I want to once again thank all the railway workers for their conscientiousness, for the fact that they show with their work how the ordinary performance of official duties in unusual circumstances becomes an important part of the movement of the entire nation towards victory in the war. During the day, an air alert was announced several times in most regions of our country. There are downed Shaheds, there are downed Kalibrs. In particular, eight Shaheds were shot down by the unit of the 301st Nikopol anti-aircraft missile regiment. Two Kalibrs were destroyed by the units of the South and Center air commands. I thank you warriors for this result! In the south, as usual, the fighters of the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade named after Yakov Handziuk have good results. They destroy enemy equipment, Russian manpower. The fighters of the 406th separate artillery brigade are also doing a great job - very precisely. The most fierce fighting throughout this week is concentrated in Donbas - Bakhmut and Soledar. We are holding our positions. And in these and some other directions in the Donetsk region, the Russian army has already spent as many lives of its people and as much ammunition as it probably did not spend in the two Chechen wars combined. But the real level of Russia's losses is concealed from Russian society. They even concealed their mobilization now and are simply lying to people that the mobilization task has allegedly been completed. The truth is, in the regions of Russia and on our occupied territory, they continue to collect people to send them to death. And this absolutely insane stubbornness of the owners of today's Russia is the best indicator that everything they tell some foreign leaders about their alleged readiness for negotiations is just as false. When someone thinks about negotiations, he does not look for ways to deceive everyone around him in order to send tens or hundreds of thousands more people to the meat grinder - mobilized or in the form of some mercenaries. And it is very good that the world perceives Russian rhetoric as it deserves, namely as a lie, and pays attention only to what the terrorist state actually does. Does, not says. We are ready for peace, for a fair and just peace, the formula of which we have voiced many times. The world knows our position. This is respect for the UN Charter, respect for our territorial integrity, respect for our people and due responsibility for terror - this is punishment for all those who are guilty and full compensation by Russia for the damage caused to us. Today we have a very important statement from the ministers of foreign affairs of the G7, a very thorough one. It covers key aspects of the situation in our defense against Russian aggression. I especially want to thank the partners for creating a coordination mechanism to help our country rebuild its critical energy infrastructure. Today we have a new defense assistance package from our American friends. The amount of the package is $400 million. And in particular, it is armored vehicles, which we very much need to move forward at the front. I am grateful to President Biden, the U.S. Congress and the entire American people for the continued and vital assistance. I would like to single out the Netherlands, which announced its next package of military assistance. The amount is 125 million euros. This is, in particular, what will ensure the strengthening of our tank units - together with American and Czech efforts. Jake Sullivan, U.S. President's National Security Advisor, visited Kyiv today. He is constantly working in communication with Head of the Office Andriy Yermak, and this line of Ukrainian-American interaction is very helpful to us in protecting the state. We are working on the issue of air defense and anti-missile defense for Ukraine. Today, I celebrated Mr. Sullivan's personal efforts by presenting him with one of the most honorable awards of our state - the Order of Yaroslav the Wise. And we discussed in detail with Mr. Sullivan how we can further strengthen our interaction. These days, the First Lady of Ukraine and representatives of our government visited Portugal - the Web Summit, one of the most powerful annual events for the global IT industry, took place there. Olena opened the summit with her speech. She called on the IT community to help protect our state, and this requires very technological things. And we feel that there will be a response. In general, Ukraine was represented at the Web Summit by the largest team in history: representatives of leading IT companies, foundations, and more than 70 Ukrainian startups. The IT industry is one of the foundations of the modern economy, and even this year - despite everything - our export of computer services is growing - and significantly compared to the 21st year, and Ukrainian IT companies attracted about $350 million in investments. This is a serious result, but we will do everything to make the result even greater. There was also a meeting of the First Lady with the leaders of Portugal - the President and the Prime Minister. I thank them for the support and willingness to help Ukraine more. And one more thing. November 4 is the day when an important step was taken in the development of our sovereign statehood. 31 years ago, on this very day, the Law of Ukraine \"On the State Border\" was adopted. This is one of the first fundamental documents of restored Ukrainian independence. We remember every corner of our country. We will liberate all our cities and villages, no matter what the occupiers plan to prolong their stay on Ukrainian soil. Ukraine will be free. And our entire border will be restored - both on land and at sea. Both in the east and in the south. Glory to all who bring our victory closer! Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Staff today – it was quite long, three hours. We analyzed the situation on the front line in great detail – in all directions, on the energy front, the situation on the borders. The Commander-in-Chief, commanders, head of intelligence, Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, head of border guards delivered reports. We know what the enemy is preparing for. We will respond and continue to liberate our land. Everything related to the defense forces supply support was also analyzed thoroughly. These are equipment, ammunition, communication, winter uniforms. Countermeasures against missile and drone terror were considered separately – there are already quite significant results in this, the percentage of shooting down has become higher, but there is still work to be done. We must ensure full protection of the Ukrainian sky and will continue to do everything possible and impossible for this. In the coming weeks, we expect good news regarding air defense and anti-missile defense for Ukraine. By the way, today there were messages from Iran, from official representatives. There they decided to admit that they did supply drones for Russian terror. But even in this confession they lied. We shoot down at least ten Iranian drones every day, and the Iranian regime claims that it allegedly gave little and even before the start of the full-scale invasion. Only during one day yesterday, 11 Shahed drones were destroyed. We know for sure that Iranian instructors taught Russian terrorists how to use drones, and Tehran is generally silent about it. And if Iran continues lying about the obvious, it means that the world will make even more efforts to investigate the terrorist cooperation between the Russian and Iranian regimes and what Russia is paying Iran for such cooperation. There will be no such thing in the modern world that any of the terrorists or their accomplices will remain unpunished. The situation on the front line did not undergo significant changes during the day. The greatest brutality of the occupiers, as before, is focused in Donetsk region. But constant fighting continues in other parts of the front as well – this is more than one thousand kilometers of the line of combat clashes. Today, I would like to pay particular attention to the National Guardsmen who defend our state in Luhansk region as part of the defense forces. In particular, the soldiers of the 27th Pechersk Brigade of the National Guard, who, together with units of the Ground Forces, very effectively erase enemy equipment and the occupiers. Thank you guys! We are doing everything so that you and all other soldiers have even more opportunities to chase the enemy. And the next weeks will be very important from this point of view – we are working extremely closely with our partners to get more tanks, more \"armor,\" more artillery for Ukraine. I would also like to mention our border guards – those who continue strengthening the borders in Sumy region, Chernihiv region and Kharkiv region despite constant Russian shelling and provocations. In some border areas of our country, terrorists use mortar fire and there is a constant threat of rocket attacks almost every day. Thank you, guys, for your persistence and endurance! This week it was possible to ensure the continuation of the operation of the grain corridor in the Black Sea. According to the results of seven days, 28 vessels carrying more than 800,000 tonnes of foodstuffs left the ports of Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdenny. The destinations are Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Algeria, Oman, Turkey, China and Ethiopia. Moreover, the ship to Ethiopia with 30,000 tonnes of wheat on board was chartered by the UN Food Program. And this is a typical list of countries that consume most of our agricultural exports. It was the example of the grain export initiative by which we showed that the world is capable of guaranteeing stability despite any threats posed by Russia. The world did not succumb to Russian blackmail, key actors acted decisively, and as a result, the aggravation of the food crisis was avoided. This is one of the most significant international results of the entire autumn. When the world is united, terrorists stand no chance. Another proof of the power of real world unity is the work of our charity platform UNITED24. Today is exactly six months after its launch. Nearly $220 million received in donations from millions of people of more than hundred countries. Drones, helicopters, demining machines are being bought for Ukraine, in particular the very effective Armtraс machines, dozens of ambulance vehicles that are already used in the frontline areas. Star ambassadors joined the project: Andriy Shevchenko, Elina Svitolina, Oleksandr Usyk, Demna, Liev Schreiber, Mark Hamill, Imagine Dragons, Barbra Streisand, Scott Kelly and Timothy Snyder. I thank every UNITED24 donor and ambassador, the project team and everyone who helps us defend ourselves against Russian terror! And, by the way, next week we will launch another fundraising direction – we will raise funds for a fleet of marine drones. I think absolutely everyone understands what this is and what it is needed for, and I am sure that millions of people will support this direction in our defense. Everyone has already seen how it works. And this is only for the protection of our marine water area, we claim nothing that does not belong to us. Glory to all who fight and work for Ukraine! Glory to every our hero! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I spoke with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. It was a very productive conversation. Working conversation. We have got confirmation from the President regarding macro-financial support for Ukraine - until the end of this year and next year. The scope and details of this program will be presented by our European friends already in the upcoming week. We also talked about assistance in restoring our energy sector and energy infrastructure. I am also grateful for the full support of our efforts to preserve the grain export initiative. Of course, increasing pressure on the Iranian regime was discussed today with Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen. Its complicity in Russian terror must be punished. And we will bring this issue not only to the level of our traditional partners. The whole world will know that the Iranian regime helps Russia prolong this war, and therefore prolong the effect of those threats to the world provoked precisely by the Russian war. If it was not for the Iranian supply of weapons to the aggressor, we would be closer to peace now. And this means closer to a complete solution to the food crisis. Closer to solving the cost of living crisis. Closer to stabilization at the energy market. Closer to reliable security against radiation blackmail, which Russia does not give up. Therefore, absolutely everyone who helps Russia prolong this war must bear responsibility for the consequences of this war along with it. Today, the occupiers used Iranian attack drones again. There are downed ones. But, unfortunately, there are also hits. We also understand that the terrorist state is concentrating forces and means for a possible repetition of mass attacks on our infrastructure. First of all, energy. In particular, for this, Russia needs Iranian missiles. We are preparing to respond. But also, please note: more and more often there are reports that not a single Kalibr carrier has gone on combat duty in the Black Sea. This is a significant result, which was ensured by our defenders. The smaller the Russian Black Sea fleet, the safer it is in the Black Sea. And there will definitely be a day when we will announce that we have provided Ukraine with full protection from the Russian threat both at sea and in the sky. I am sure of it. Very fierce Russian attacks in the Donetsk region continue. The enemy suffers serious losses there, but despite everything, despite any losses, he continues to drive his mobilized soldiers and mercenaries to their deaths. I thank all our warriors who withstand this terrible pressure, who remain steadfast and heroically defend our positions. And I especially want to single out today the fighters of the 79th separate airborne assault brigade for their bravery and heroism during the defense in the Avdiivka direction. I also thank everyone involved in eliminating the consequences of Russian terrorist attacks in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, cities and communities of the Dnipropetrovsk region, and Mykolaiv. We will definitely drive out the occupiers, we will definitely guarantee the safety of all our cities, all our communities. As of this evening, stabilization blackouts continue in Kyiv and six regions. More than 4.5 million consumers are without electricity. Most of them are now in Kyiv and the Kyiv region. It’s really difficult. During the week, I had several special meetings with government officials, representatives of energy companies and regional administrations regarding probable scenarios in the energy sector. We consider each scenario in detail and prepare appropriate actions. No matter what the terrorists want, no matter what they try to achieve, we must endure this winter and be even stronger in the spring than we are now, be even more ready for the liberation of our entire territory than now. Every month we have to set difficult goals and, passing through them, become even stronger. Glory to all who fight and work for our victory! Gratitude to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I’ve just spoken with Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the bloc that won the elections in Israel. I congratulated him on victory. We discussed the main aspects of relations between our states. I think it is clear to everyone what Ukraine emphasizes and what security emphasis Israel makes. I believe that we can significantly strengthen our states, especially since the threats to us are related. Today, the occupiers struck more than 50 settlements in our country. Donbas, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region, Mykolaiv region, Kharkiv region, Dnipropetrovsk region... Missiles, aviation, MLRS. We respond everywhere. We have the necessary results - another Russian aircraft was shot down. We also received new systems that significantly strengthen our air defense. The protection of the Ukrainian sky is, of course, not one hundred percent, but we are gradually moving towards our goal. As of today, we can say that the recent escalation of Russian missile and drone terror has only resulted in the world responding - responding with new aid to Ukraine. We will do everything so that as many countries as possible join this aid. In general, along the front, our forces are in a state of active defense - in some parts of the east and south, we are gradually pushing back the enemy. We are gradually moving forward. The Donetsk region remains the epicenter of the greatest madness of the occupiers - they die by the hundreds every day. The ground in front of the Ukrainian positions is literally littered with the bodies of the occupiers... And some of the Russian military started to think about what was happening. They \"complained\" to the governor of their region - Primorsky Krai - about colossal losses. And this governor, comrade Kozhemyako, predictably lied in response: he says that the losses are \"far from being such\". Not such... And what kind are they? From Vladivostok to Pavlovka, Donetsk region, it is more than 9 thousand kilometers. But he is sure that the losses \"are not such.\" The governor, probably, can better see from there how many soldiers from his region are sent for slaughter and in what way. Or he was simply ordered to lie. Ordered from Moscow. This is how the order to lie about Russian losses crosses thousands of kilometers. And even the bodies of most of those killed will not be brought back to some Vladivostok. But I am sure that Governor Kozhemyako will come out and explain why not everyone arrived, not everyone from those “not such” returned. You can avoid this not by complaining to some wimps, but by your own opinion. And not in Telegram, but in public. Not by a complaint, but by a fierce protest. Not somewhere under the blanket, but on the streets. Against those in Moscow. Or by surrendering to Ukrainian captivity. This is how you can survive as well. Decision regarding some Ukrainian enterprises was announced today. This decision was dictated by military necessity and was agreed upon at the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. Five strategic enterprises were forcibly alienated for wartime needs - Motor Sich, KrAZ, Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta and Zaporizhtransformator. Some of them hardly worked. Now all of them will work. For defense. This is the repair and production of equipment, provision of the defense forces, and restoration of our infrastructure. A complex task that can be accomplished only through the system of military-state management. I do not rule out other similar decisions either. I delivered an important international address today. Climate summit in Egypt. A very significant event, a very representative gathering. Dozens of state leaders and heads of government. The main thing for us is to inform the world about the ongoing Russian aggression, about the destabilizing influence that Russia exerts. When the world is focused on combating war, energy and food crises, the destruction of customary international relations, the climate agenda is clearly suffering. And the destruction of the climate cannot somehow be put on hold... Therefore, anyone who is serious about the climate agenda should also be serious about the need to immediately stop Russian aggression, restore our territorial integrity, and force Russia into genuine peace negotiations. Into such negotiations, which we have repeatedly proposed, and to which we always received insane Russian responses with new terrorist attacks, shelling or blackmail. Once again - restoration of territorial integrity, respect for the UN Charter, compensation for all damages caused by the war, punishment of every war criminal and guarantees that this will not happen again. These are completely understandable conditions. Today I signed the decree on awarding our heroes. 396 Ukrainian servicemen were honored with state awards. Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine!  Thank you to everyone who works for our victory! Thank you to all our partners who help us defend freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Friends! It is a great honor to be awarded with the Medal of Liberty, presented to me by senators Chris Coons and Rob Portman during their visit to Kyiv. This award really demonstrates how and what Ukrainian people are fighting for. Liberty is the main word for us and what really unites all Ukrainians. As in any democratic society, Ukrainians have different views on life and politics. As the case was in previous years, we felt divided arguing whether we would ever be able to stand together. But when Russia decided to destroy our freedom and wipe Ukraine off the face of the earth, we immediately got united and we keep this unity. All divisions are put aside. There is no place for political conflicts. Because when there is a mortal threat to freedom, everything else is not important. Millions of people are fighting and working to protect Ukraine. They are very different people. After the Russian full-scale invasion started, they all decided – \"we are here\" and we will never give up our freedom. And I believe that this Liberty Medal is for all men and women of Ukraine who, after the 24th of February, showed to the world's largest autocracy that only defeat is what it can win in Ukraine.  These are our soldiers and officers. This is a massive wave of our volunteers – those who provide our defenders with everything they need. These are farmers who stopped Russian armored vehicles on the roads to their communities and helped the Army. These are IT specialists, who build defense against Russian cyberattacks. These are companies that work despite constant Russian terror and keep jobs for Ukrainians. These are doctors who help always everywhere. These are school teachers and university professors who can read lectures  even in bomb shelters and distantly from the trenches on the front lines, but they do not give up and teach children – teach them to believe in themselves, in freedom and in Ukraine. In less than nine months, more than thirty thousand Ukrainians have been honored state awards for their contribution to our national defense. First of all, they are our heroic soldiers. These are rescuers who do away with the effects of Russian shelling. These are energy workers who return electricity to people after Russian missiles and Iranian drones hit power plants – Russia wants to leave millions of our people without energy in the winter. These are transport workers who supply our defense, economy and communities. These are different people of various jobs who are all equally fight against the invasion. However, this Liberty Medal is an award not only for our people. When this war began, Ukraine heard something very important from the world – we heard that \"the democracies are here.\" And we see now what democracies are capable of when they act in unity. Every potential aggressor in the world sees the help that the United States and the free world is providing to us, and all the sanctions imposed against Russia – sees and believes that it is better not to start a war against freedom at all. In fact, this is one of the greatest contributions to the global peace and security during our lifetime. Together with our partners, we are developing a new security architecture – these are security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe which will not only re-empower the principles of the UN Charter, but will also become a model for nations in other parts of the world – a model to avoid new cruel wars. And that is why, I believe that this Liberty Medal is also to all friends of freedom in the United States and other countries. To all those, who are helping us to restore our territorial integrity, and thus to restore peace. This Liberty Medal is to those who support us with weapons, air defense systems, fInance and diplomacy. To those who are helping to rebuild after the Russian strikes. To those who impose sanctions against Russia and its accomplices such as the Iranian regime. When after the beginning of the Russian invasion, I said – \"the president is here\", when millions of Ukrainians decided at the same time – \"we are here\" and we will not surrender, and when the world supported us, saying – \"democracies are here\", then it meant and still mean – \"freedom is here \", \"human dignity is here\", \"law is here\". And one day it will definitely mean – \"peace is here\". I call on you to maintain unwavering unity, as it is now, until that very day when we all hear those important words we have been dreaming of… Until we hear that peace has finally been restored. Democracies must not stop on their way to the victory. I thank you for your attention!  Thank you for your support – President Biden, both parties of the Congress, and every American citizen! Please know that you support not just a country or its leader, you support millions of people who, like you, cherish freedom. And I decided to send the prize money of our Liberty Medal to help Ukrainian veterans – to rebuild and modernize the rehabilitation center for veterans in the city of Borodyanka, Kyiv region of Ukraine. Let everything bring our victory closer!"

  "speech": "Dear colleagues! Dear Mr. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi! Ladies and Gentlemen! At this Conference, like at other summits and high level meetings on catastrophic climate change, there is no lack of words. There is no lack of good definitions and no shortage of prescriptions for what the world should do. I listened to some of the speeches today – and I agree with many of the assessments. The world is on the brink. And beyond this limit – devastating changes that will forever change the usual life on all continents. Colleagues have described well what this means. No one can stay aside. And the poorer the person, the poorer the family, the poorer the country – the more painful the effects of climate change will be for them. However, this also applies to all rich nations – it is impossible to buy off the destruction of the climate. But why do we keep talking about it every year? Why instead of reports on what has been done, the same forecasts and appeals are made every year? I will be honest – there are still many who do not take the climate agenda seriously. And not only in politics, but also in big business. There are still many for whom climate change is just rhetoric or marketing or political ritual – whatever, but not real action. They are the ones who hamper the implementation of climate goals. They are the ones in their offices who make fun of those who fight to save life on the planet, although in public they seem to support the work for the sake of nature in every possible way. They are the ones who start wars of aggression when the planet cannot afford a single gunshot, because it needs global joint actions. You all know about the war that Russia started in Europe, trying to destroy the independence of my country. But what does this war mean? This Russian war has brought about an energy crisis that has forced dozens of countries to resume coal-fired power generation in order to lower energy prices for their people at least a little... To lower prices that are shockingly rising due to deliberate Russian actions. The Russian war brought an acute food crisis to the world, which hit worst those countries suffering from the existing manifestations of climate change – catastrophic droughts, large-scale floods. The Russian war destroyed 5 million acres of forests in Ukraine in less than six months! Not every country in the world has such an area of forests that were burned in Ukraine by Russian shelling. We have to check every day the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. If there is no radiation leaks? The Russian army has turned this nuclear power plant de-facto into a military training ground. They are constantly \"playing\" with connecting and disconnecting the plant and nuclear reactors from the power grid. This is a direct risk of a radiation disaster. Who will care, for example, about the amount of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere if part of Europe or the Middle East, and possibly northern Africa, God forbid, are covered by a radiation cloud after an accident in Zaporizhzhia? Last year we could not even imagine that kind of question, but this year Russia has posed dozens of such questions to the world. Ladies and Gentlemen! World needs honesty.We must tell those who do not take the climate agenda seriously that they are making a catastrophic mistake. We must stop those who, with their insane and illegal war, are destroying the world's ability to work united for a common goal. There can be no effective climate policy without peace on the Earth. Because, in fact, nations are thinking only about how to protect themselves here and now from the threats created in particular by the Russian aggression. Russia needs to shut the guns and hide its missiles so the world finally hears what we can all really do together to save ourselves from the climate disaster. All of us – in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, Australia. I invite you all to support our initiative presented here at the Conference – creation of a global platform to assess the Impact of military actions on climate and environment. We are all thinking about how to generate hundreds of billions of dollars to help developing countries protect themselves from the climate change. Under these conditions, how can anyone cause additional insane damage to the nature with their invasive military ambitions? Such ambitions deserve only punishment. Mr. President of Egypt said an important thing in his speech: we must meet expectations of the people all over the world – people who are suffering more than ever. I absolutely support this goal. We must ensure that suffering does not multiply because the world does not have time to respond to climate challenges. But to do this, we need joint effective actions. And for them to be, we need peace. And I thank everyone who works for peace! I thank everyone who takes seriously the need to protect life on the Earth for the benefit of all people – all nations, all classes, all cultures. I thank you for your attention."

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! An important preparatory week for us continues on the eve of diplomatic activities in the second half of November. These are important summits: G20, ASEAN, NATO Parliamentary Assembly and some others. The position of Ukraine must be and will be heard in all parts of the world. We are also working to continue and expand our grain export initiative. We will add a permanent humanitarian component to grain exports. Together with the advanced and most conscientious states, we will increase aid to those countries and peoples who are particularly suffering from the food crisis. And the first meetings have already taken place, we already have the first international agreements. In fact, together with our partners, we are starting cooperation, which can become the basis for guaranteeing food security at a new level. It has long been said that global coordination is needed to save the world's poorest countries from starvation. And we are currently developing such a coordination mechanism. I hope it will be implemented. Today I met with United States Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and a significant part of our talks was devoted to humanitarian topics. Because the more meaningful our cooperation with partners to overcome various humanitarian problems will be, the less international conflicts and crises will be used by Russia to blackmail the international community. We separately discussed with Mrs. Thomas-Greenfield our steps within the UN General Assembly and draft resolutions proposed by Ukraine. It is very important that we talked about how to ensure the access of representatives of the UN and the Red Cross to Ukrainian men and women held in Russian captivity. We use every day and every international opportunity to move closer to the release of all our people from captivity. We remember everyone who is being held captive by the occupiers. In the information space, there is a certain decrease in the number of news from the front. There are fewer messages than, for example, at the beginning of autumn. But this does not mean that the intensity of the fighting has become less. The situation is difficult on the entire front. In some areas, brutal positional battles continue, as before, and it is especially difficult - also as before - in the Donetsk region. The activity of the occupiers there remains at an extremely high level - dozens of attacks every day. They suffer extremely large-scale losses, but their order has not changed - to reach the administrative border of the Donetsk region. We do not give up a single centimeter of our land there. And I thank all our heroes who are holding positions in Donbas. Kherson region. We clearly understand what the enemy is planning, so we act accordingly. Carefully, thoughtfully and in the interests of the liberation of our entire territory. We are reinforcing our positions, ruining Russian logistics, and consistently destroying the potential of the occupiers to keep the south of our country under occupation. East. Step by step, we are moving towards the return of the Ukrainian flag to all our cities and communities. We are also actively reinforcing the border. At the same time, work continues to restore normal life in the liberated areas. Only in the past day and only, for example, in two districts of the Kharkiv region, gas and electricity have been restored to more than a thousand households. Repair work is also ongoing at all the energy facilities damaged by the recent Russian strikes. As of this evening, about 4 million Ukrainians in 14 regions and the city of Kyiv are disconnected from electricity supply. But most of them are disconnected based on stabilization schedules, not on an emergency basis. I thank all our energy workers, utility workers, regional administrations, local self-governments - everyone who restores the predictability of life to our people even in such conditions. Today, the government of Ukraine made an important decision that will help get through the winter period. The import of goods needed during the heating season will be exempt from VAT and import duty. This should simplify and reduce the cost of supplying Ukraine with generators, batteries, transformers and other equipment for energy and heat supply. It is also important that sufficient volumes of gas and coal are being accumulated to provide for Ukrainians. We clearly understand: turning winter into a weapon is the plan of a terrorist state against our state, as well as against the whole of Europe. But we are doing everything so that this Russian plan also fails, like various previous ones. And one more thing. On the Walk of the Brave in Kyiv, we opened a plaque that appeared there first. This is a plaque dedicated to Sean Penn. He was in Ukraine on February 24 and since that day he has been doing everything to help us accumulate international support. The Walk of the Brave is not just a sign of our gratitude to political, public and cultural leaders who defend freedom together with Ukrainians, but also a reminder to all future generations of our people about what different people, forces and industries united for our victory. The Walk of the Brave will feature all the leaders who supported Ukraine personally, coming to our land at the crucial time of a full-scale war. When such a leader arrives in Ukraine now, we open his name plaque. In general, dozens of names will be presented on the Walk of the Brave. To date, in addition to Sean Penn, the following have already been honored: President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, President of Poland Andrzej Duda, President of Latvia Egils Levits, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Petr Fiala, Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša, Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki, Deputy Prime Minister of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! Glory to everyone who fights for our state! Glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today, the day started very early with a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The situation at the front line was analyzed in detail. South, east... Very carefully – Donbas. The greatest confrontation is now in Donetsk region, it's very important, a lot is being decided there. Any losses there are further losses in the country. That's why we stand. We stand firm. We don't surrender anything. I thank each of our heroes who are holding back these terrible attacks of the occupiers. Constant attacks. South. We are moving gradually, strengthening our positions step by step. There is a lot of joy in the media space today, and it is clear why. But our emotions must be restrained – always during war. I will definitely not feed the enemy with all the details of our operations, either in the south, or in the east, or anywhere else. When we have our result, everyone will see it. For sure. Maybe it doesn't sound like what anyone expects now. Maybe not as in the news. But you need to understand: no one just gets away if they don't feel the strength. The enemy does not bring us gifts, does not make \"gestures of goodwill.\" We fight our way up. And when you are fighting, you must understand that every step is always resistance from the enemy, it is always the loss of the lives of our heroes. Therefore, we move very carefully, without emotions, without unnecessary risk. In the interests of the liberation of our entire land and so that the losses are as small as possible. This is how we will secure the liberation of Kherson, Kakhovka, Donetsk, and other our cities. But this will be the result of our efforts, our defense operations, those that are currently ongoing, those that we are planning. And now I want separately and once again to warn everyone in Moscow who makes the relevant decisions: any attempt by you to blow up the Kakhovka HPP and flood our territory and dehydrate the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will mean that you are declaring war on the whole world. Think what will happen to you then. At the meeting of the Staff we also discussed the supply and production of weapons – our weapons – the repair of equipment, the strengthening of our anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense, which is ongoing, the recovery of critical infrastructure, primarily energy, after the Russian terrorist attacks. As of this evening, there are electricity blackouts to stabilize the situation in 15 regions and the city of Kyiv. There are no emergency blackouts. Wherever electricity is out, it should be in accordance with published schedules. Please, if the blackout at your house or street is not on schedule today, notify the local authorities and representatives of the energy company that serves you. They must change the situation and stick to the schedule. I spoke today with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte. Just about recovering our energy sector, protection of the Ukrainian sky. Thank you for your willingness to help! Separately, we discussed the export grain initiative, the fundamental need to extend and expand our grain exports. We agreed to cooperate even more closely to support Ukrainian initiatives at the UN. Tomorrow will be a very active negotiation day – many contacts are planned. It is these days that we are completing our preparations for Ukraine's possible participation in the G20 summit next week. The Ukrainian stance has been shaped. As always, our stance will be in the interests of global security. In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our soldiers. 106 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were given state awards. And one more thing is very important. Today is the Day of Ukrainian Writing and Language and the Ukrainian Day of Cultural Workers and Masters of Folk Art. There was also a dictation of national unity. I thank everyone who joined writing the dictation, it is an important annual tradition. And you know... Today I want to congratulate not only those who teach languages and literature, work in the field of culture and preserve folk art. I want to congratulate all our people. Ukraine holds. Ukraine defends itself. And will definitely defend. It is no longer a question of whether Ukraine and everything Ukrainian exist. Ukraine exists. Ukraine will exist. And our enemy will die – they will die like the dew does in the sunshine. Or like the Russian river crossings under the strikes of the HIMARS systems. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we have good news from the south. The number of Ukrainian flags returning to their rightful place in the framework of the ongoing defense operation is already dozens. 41 settlements were liberated. I thank all our heroes who make this advance possible. Armed Forces, intelligence, special services... Everyone. And I will especially mention the warriors of the 28th separate mechanized brigade, the 46th airborne assault brigade, the 60th separate infantry brigade and the 128th separate mountain assault brigade. Those who implement offensive actions. Thank you guys! Now we are all happy to see how the Ukrainians who remained in the occupied villages and cities meet our warriors. Many are now checking almost every hour where our units have reached and where else our national flag was raised. But, rejoicing, we should all remember now and always what this movement means, we should remember that every step of our defense forces is the lives of our warriors. Lives given for freedom for Ukrainians. Everything that is happening now has been achieved by months of fierce struggle. It was achieved through courage, pain, and loss. It's not the enemy leaving. It is the Ukrainians who drive the occupiers out at a heavy cost. Just as in the east of our country, in the Kharkiv region. Just as before, in the north - Kyiv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region. Now - Mykolaiv region, Kherson region. We have to go all the way - on the battlefield and in diplomacy - for our flags, Ukrainian flags, and never again enemy tricolors, to be hoisted on our entire land, along our entire internationally recognized border. It will be so. Our warriors are virtually immediately followed to the liberated areas by those who restore all conditions for normal life. The first and basic one is demining. The occupiers leave behind thousands of unexploded mines and munitions. I have often heard estimates that clearing Ukraine of Russian mines will take decades. We can't wait that long. We have to do in years what elsewhere in the world could have taken decades after hostilities. First of all, houses, social facilities, communications, roads - the entire space of people's lives - are being demined. But the occupiers mine everything: power lines, enterprise buildings, fields, forests. At the peak of mine contamination in Ukraine, we had 300,000 square kilometers of dangerous territory. Today, thanks to the true heroism of Ukrainian sappers and pyrotechnicians, our rescuers and everyone who helps them, the area of land contaminated by mines and munitions has been reduced. Now about 170,000 square kilometers remain for demining. In particular, this is also the case in the most difficult areas - where hostilities are still ongoing, where the enemy will add mines before his retreat, as it is now in Kherson... Plus forests, plus a huge area of fields. I am grateful to our partners who are already implementing mine clearance assistance projects. These are the US, Canada and Great Britain, as well as Denmark, Norway, Estonia, Austria, Poland, Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, Slovakia, UN structures. Any person on earth - everyone who supports Ukraine - can make a personal contribution through our United24 charity platform. In particular, thanks to such aid, we have already purchased the first most effective demining machine - Armtrac 400 which is currently operating in the Kharkiv region. It covers 1.5 hectares in an hour, fully guaranteeing the disposal of mines. And first of all, it clears the territory along the power lines so that energy workers can fulfill their duties and restore power supply. We will add more such equipment and speed up demining wherever we return our flag, our normal Ukrainian life. The forces of the National Police immediately follow the warriors to the liberated areas. Today, the police entered Kalynivske, Bobrovyi Kut, Yevhenivka, Kotsyubynske and Snihurivka. Stabilization measures began there. I had two important phone calls today. Together with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom we discussed further defense support for our country and exchanged views of the ongoing frontline operations. We are preparing for important international events next week, in particular for the G20 summit, we are coordinating positions with partners. Together with the Prime Minister of Canada we also discussed the G20, our initiatives within the UN - we have important draft resolutions that we propose the General Assembly to support. Separately, we touched upon the areas of defense and security cooperation that already exist with Canada. We are planning to expand our cooperation. There are still important negotiations scheduled for tomorrow. Today I also want to thank the Netherlands for another step to strengthen our defense. 100 million euros will go to the fund to support our defense. These funds, as well as funds from other partners, will be used to purchase equipment directly from manufacturers and will work for the future. For Ukraine to become stronger. And one more thing. Today we have the announcement of a new military assistance package from the United States of America. Important means of air defense. Just what we needed, what we asked for. Glory to all who fight and work for our country and our people! Gratitude to everyone who helps! Eternal glory to all those who give their lives for Ukraine and who gave their lives. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Strong people of our indomitable, beautiful and united country! Today is a historic day. We are regaining the south of our country, regaining Kherson. As of now, our defenders are approaching the city, there is still quite a bit left and we are starting to enter. However, special units are already in the city. The people of Kherson were waiting. They never gave up on Ukraine. Hope for Ukraine is always justified - and Ukraine always regains its own. I am happy to see how people, despite all the threats, despite the repression and abuse of the occupiers, cherished the Ukrainian flags, believed in Ukraine... And even when the city is not yet completely cleansed of the enemy's presence, the people of Kherson themselves are already removing Russian symbols and any traces of the occupiers' stay in Kherson from the streets and buildings. It was the same in all other cities liberated by our defenders. It will be the same in those cities that are still waiting for our return. Ukraine will come to all its people. Due to our strength on the battlefield and in diplomacy, we will restore the territorial integrity of our state. I thank every warrior and every unit of the defense forces who are making this offensive operation in the south possible now. Absolutely everyone - from privates to generals. The Armed Forces, intelligence, Security Service, National Guard - all who were bringing this day closer for the Kherson region. We will name all the heroes soon. And they will be awarded even sooner. Shortly after our defense forces reach the designated frontiers, stabilization measures will begin in Kherson, as was the case everywhere. We consistently neutralize the threats. The first is mines. The occupiers left a lot of mines and explosives, in particular on vital objects. We will carry out demining. It is very important: now, when demining has not even begun, we cannot ensure access of media representatives to Kherson. It is necessary to demine at least basic communications, check the main objects. We will restore all conditions of normal life - as much as possible. Our defenders are immediately followed by policemen, sappers, rescuers, energy workers... Medicine, communications, social services are returning... Life is returning. I would like to separately address those Russian soldiers, mercenaries and collaborators who were left behind in Kherson and other cities of the south. The only chance for salvation for you is to surrender to Ukrainian captivity. We guarantee that you will be treated in accordance with the law and international standards. And to those Russian soldiers who have put on civilian clothes and are hiding somewhere I want to say that there is no point in hiding. We'll find you anyway. Don't drag it out. Voluntary Ukrainian captivity is the only option for all occupiers. I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. First and foremost is the situation on the frontline, of course, with an emphasis on the developments in the south. But we do not reduce our attention to other areas. We are moving everywhere, reinforcing our positions everywhere. We are holding the line in the Donetsk region. Separately, the situation in the energy sector and the course of restoration work were reviewed. Last night, the occupiers dealt another blow to our critical infrastructure. It is because of this that emergency blackouts had to be applied in parts of the country this morning and afternoon. But in most cities and districts we managed to return to the schedule of stabilization energy restrictions. And we are working as actively as possible to strengthen our ability to protect the sky and restore everything that the occupiers, unfortunately, destroyed. I spoke today with Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz. Informed him about the situation in Kherson, generally at the front. I thanked him for the next steps in defense support, we agreed on the development of such cooperation. Of course, preparations for the G20 summit were discussed. It is obvious that Russia does not think about peace. Another terrorist attack on Mykolaiv, the destruction of a residential building by a Russian rocket is a clear proof of what really worries Russia: not how to reach peace, but how to inflict the most painful damage... Not how to start real negotiations, but how to hit something with a missile or drone in Ukraine so that Ukrainians suffer... Well, Ukraine and the world have the power to punish the terrorists for everything they have done and restore peace. Peace on our terms. Our fundraising platform, United24, has launched a fundraising campaign for a fleet of naval drones. I announced that. So, now everyone - and not only in Ukraine, but also in other countries - can join the formation of the world's first naval drone fleet - something that can provide security to our marine area. The first naval drone, for which funds were raised in less than an hour, was named \"Kherson\". Quite logical. We will call the second naval drone \"Sevastopol\". I believe that all this is bringing the time of the liberation of our Crimea closer. I had a meeting with the Lithuanian delegation led by the Speaker of the Seimas of Lithuania. It is symbolic that her name is Viktorija. And it is on such a day that she is with us. I thanked our Lithuanian friends for their help, for the defense support that we have been receiving since the beginning of the Russian invasion. We discussed a wide range of topics: further cooperation in defense, our reconstruction, European and Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine. And one more thing. Today, another 45 Ukrainian defenders were released from Russian captivity, all of them are warriors of the Armed Forces, soldiers and sergeants. We remember all our heroes who are still in captivity. We will return each and every one. Our team - Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Maliuk, Lubinets and others - works every day to free all our people from Russian captivity. I sincerely thank everyone who cares about Ukraine! Glory to everyone who fights for freedom! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today we all feel enthusiastic together. I don't know if we have at least one person who hasn't watched the video of our Kherson people greeting the Ukrainian defenders. Months of Russian occupation, months of the mockery of our people, months of stories that Russia is supposedly there forever... And still, there is a sea of Ukrainian flags on the streets. People did not even think of refusing Ukraine. And the world sees it now. It sees what it means when Ukrainians meet their own people. It sees what the unity of Ukrainians means. And it sees why we should liberate our entire land from the invaders. We will see many more such greetings. In those cities and villages that are still under occupation. We don't forget anyone, we won't leave anyone. Thanks to our defense operations and diplomacy, we will definitely reach our state border – all sections of the internationally recognized border of Ukraine. As of this evening, the defense forces have won back control in more than 60 settlements of Kherson region, the police have started taking stabilization measures. Stabilization measures are also ongoing in Kherson itself. Everywhere in the liberated territory, our bomb-disposal experts have a lot of work to do. Almost 2,000 explosive items have already been removed – mines, trip wires, and unexploded ammunition. Before fleeing from Kherson, the occupiers destroyed all critical infrastructure – communication, water supply, heat, electricity... Ruscists everywhere have the same goal – mockery of people as much as possible. But we will restore everything. Believe me. Although it takes time for this, it is already clear to everyone that the outcome will be ours, the Ukrainian one. It is very important now to tell all Kherson residents to be careful and not try to independently check any buildings and objects left by the occupiers. Please, if you have a connection with the townspeople, be sure to pass this on to them. There are ten groups of bomb-disposal experts working in Kherson, the police are working, and there are various units of the defense forces. Today, unfortunately, one of our sappers was injured during demining of the administrative building. Therefore, please, dear citizens of Kherson, be careful and inform the police or rescuers about any suspicious objects you see. The same concerns residents of other settlements in the liberated territory. Please remain vigilant of your own safety. It is very important. Separately, today I want to address all our military personnel who are in other areas of the front, to all those who take care of our security at the borders, to all those who defend Ukraine in the air and at sea, to all those who work for defense in the rear regions. This success of ours in the south became possible thanks to the fact that all our defenders honorably perform their tasks. The words of thanks that our defenders in Kherson region are hearing now are words of thanks to all of you. To everyone who fights for Ukraine, who works for our victory and who, at their level, helps and achieves the results our state needs. And especially these are words of thanks to those who endure the Russian attacks on Donetsk region – it's just hell there. There are extremely brutal battles there every day. But our units defend themselves bravely, withstand the terrible pressure of the occupiers, and maintain our defense lines. It is very important. Thanks to the strong defense there, in Donetsk region, we can conduct offensive operations in other directions. I thank all our soldiers who defend Ukraine in these particularly tough battles. Pavlivka, Maryinka, Pervomaiske, Avdiyivka... The first and second battalions of the 36th Separate Brigade of Marines, the 79th Separate Assault Brigade, the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, the 68th Separate Hunter Brigade, the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the 56th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade and the 55th Zaporizka Sich Separate Artillery Brigade, which supports everyone there... Thank you, soldiers, for your courage, for your bravery! And I join the thanks and wishes that have already been heard from the people of Kherson by our fighters of the 28th and 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigades and the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, our intelligence officers, our fighters of the Special Operations Forces and national guardsmen. Well done. Thank you all for the brilliant performance of tasks for the liberation of Kherson! It will be the same in Henichesk and Melitopol. We will also come to all our cities and villages of Donbas. We will definitely see how people with Ukrainian flags, which they keep there, will meet the Ukrainian forces in Crimea, and there will be hundreds of them on the streets on the day of liberation. I thank everyone who fights and works for Ukrainian victory! I'm thankful to everyone in the world who helps us so much! Eternal glory to all those who gave their lives for their native Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! It is Sunday today. I’m in my office together with our team. The Office is working, Kyiv doesn’t stop, the country works non-stop. Look around - there are always people fighting and working without weekends for the sake of our victory. The frontline has no weekends. Rescuers and sappers have no weekends. Doctors helping the wounded have no weekends. Doctors helping our children have no weekends as well. Ukrainian energy workers fighting against Iranian drones have no rest. All our transport workers… truck drivers ensuring both the defense and the rear, Ukrzaliznytsia and all public companies.  Business, which helps. Volunteers we can’t do without. Military enterprises repairing and manufacturing equipment. Diplomats working almost round the clock for 263 days already… Communication workers, security forces, hundreds and hundreds of other spheres, thousands of organizations and enterprises, millions of people. All of us already feel the approach of our victory. Because we preserve our unity and know that we are rightfully on our land. And I thank our commanders, intelligence and everyone involved for working out our next steps. Liberation steps. Stabilization and restoration of law and order in 226 settlements will be ensured in the Kherson region. This is more than 100,000 local residents as of this time. We are restoring communication, Internet, television. We are doing everything to restore normal technical capabilities for electricity and water supply as soon as possible. We will bring back transport and postal services. We will bring back ambulances and normal medicine. Of course, the restoration of the work of authorities, the police, some private companies is already beginning. And I thank the business, which is among the first to participate in the return of normal life. Our presence will be felt! It will be felt that there is life. But please do not forget that the situation in the Kherson region is still very dangerous. First of all, there are mines. Unfortunately, one of our sappers died, and four others were injured while clearing mines. I urge all residents of Kherson to be very careful and immediately inform the rescuers about all dangerous objects. Detention of Russian soldiers and mercenaries who were left behind in this territory and neutralization of saboteurs are also ongoing. Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes, the bodies of both civilians and military personnel are being found. In the Kherson region, the Russian army left behind the same atrocities as in other regions of our country, where it was able to enter. We will find and bring to justice every murderer. Without a doubt. The fighting in the Donetsk region is as intense as in previous days. The level of Russian attacks is not decreasing. The level of resilience and bravery of our fighters is the highest. We do not allow our defense to be breached. I thank each of our warriors for this! As of now, the territory of five of our regions was hit by missile, air and artillery strikes of the occupiers during the day. These are Sumy region, Kharkiv region, Zaporizhzhia region, Luhansk region, and Donetsk region. We do everything to make the enemy feel our retaliation. To the maximum. Along the entire frontline, we ensure the destruction of enemy supply chains, ammunition depots, and enemy headquarters. We have to reduce the potential of the occupiers every day - without days off! It saves the lives of our people. And we are already very actively preparing for an important week for Ukraine - diplomatic week. There will be a G20 summit in Indonesia and our position will be presented. In a very meaningful way. We will give answers to many questions that are being asked now. Public answers. So that they are heard by all our people, all our partners, everyone who supports us. Already on Tuesday there will be my address. I am grateful to everyone who endures this marathon! I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for our country and freedom for all our people! I am grateful to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a very productive and symbolic day - a day in the Kherson region, in the Mykolaiv region. First of all, I had the honor of personally presenting our warriors with state awards. In Kherson, I presented 36 orders of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi and \"For Courage\", and handed over three more orders to wounded warriors. In particular, Brigadier General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi of the 1st degree. In September, he became the commander of the Kherson operational-strategic group of troops, and we can see the result. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to intelligence officer, sergeant Andriy Orlov. Back in September, he showed extraordinary bravery and effectiveness in battles in the Kherson region. He was wounded and recovered. Returned to the frontline. And already on November 10, as part of a reconnaissance unit, he took part in the liberation of Snihurivka. It was he who raised the Ukrainian flag over the district administration building. Of course, there will be more awards, there will be more gratitude. All our warriors who restore freedom to Ukrainians and the Ukrainian land deserve the utmost gratitude. It is so. It will be so. I held several meetings today - both in the Kherson region and in the Mykolaiv region. We will do everything to restore normal living conditions for our people. It is obvious to everyone what Ukraine is, what the presence of our flag is. When there is a Ukrainian flag, there is civilization, there is freedom. There is social security. There is infrastructure. There is security. There is someone to take care of people. There are all the things that disappear and that are destroyed when the occupier comes. This is what the Russian flag means - complete desolation. There is no electricity, no communication, no Internet, no television. The occupiers destroyed everything themselves - on purpose. This is their special operation. On the eve of winter, the Russian occupiers destroyed absolutely all critical infrastructure for the people. Absolutely all important objects in the city and region are mined. It is happiness for everyone when Russia is driven out. Happiness, which will also be in those cities and communities of ours, which are deprived of a normal life by Russia both after February 24 and in 2014. We will return everything. We will return normal life. And we know that peace for Ukraine is getting closer. For our entire country. In a few hours, I will talk about this in my address to the participants of the… G19 summit in Indonesia. This is an association of very influential states. And today, on the eve of the summit, influential statements have already been made. In particular, it is important that the United States and China jointly noted the inadmissibility of any threats to use nuclear weapons. Everyone understands whom these words are addressed to. Today, we also have decisions from our partners that strengthen Ukraine's position. I am grateful to Canada for the new package of defense support for our country in the amount of half a billion dollars. And also for new sanctions against Russian accomplices of tyranny - against the cogs of this system. I am grateful to the United States for the new sanctions. Today, sanctions have been introduced against more than 40 legal entities and individuals who help Russia wage a war. Absolutely everyone who in one way or another works for the Russian army, the defense sector, must receive complete personal isolation from the rest of the world. And then there will be punishment for complicity in terror. Within the UN, our diplomats worked for a long time with partners to agree on and adopt two very important resolutions. The first of them is supported today - regarding the creation of an international compensation mechanism that will make it possible to compensate all the losses caused by the Russian war, moreover at the expense of Russian assets. The reparations that Russia will have to pay for what it has committed are now part of the international legal reality. We are still agreeing with our partners on the second resolution - to create a special tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. We will do everything to make them both work. Today, a meeting of the Coordination Council of Ukraine for Child Protection and Safety co-chaired by UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Head of the Office Andriy Yermak was held. I thank Mr. Guterres for that. They discussed how to stop the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and return home all those who were forcibly deported. At least these are almost 11 thousand children - we know them by name. But these are only the ones we know about. And in fact, there are more deported. The meeting was also attended by the ambassadors of the leading states, whom we call on to help with the implementation of this task. We will really need the power of the whole world to bring back all the deportees. I believe that we can ensure it! I am grateful to everyone who helps Ukraine! I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for our country! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine and our people. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear President Widodo! Dear colleagues! The world’s majority, which stands with us! I address you in Ukrainian, but in front of each of you on the table you will find our proposals. In your language. In demonstration of respect for you. I have just returned to our capital. Returned from the city of Kherson. Kherson is one of the key cities in the south of our country and the only regional centre that Russia managed to occupy after February 24. And now Kherson is already liberated. What does it mean? For Ukraine, this liberation operation of our Defence Forces is reminiscent of many battles of the past, which became turning points in the wars of the past. Those battles symbolized such changes, after which people already knew who will be victorious even though the ultimate victory still had to be fought for. It is like, for example, D-Day - the landing of the Allies in Normandy. It was not yet a final point in the fight against evil, but it already determined the entire further course of events. This is exactly what we are feeling now. Now - when Kherson is free. To liberate our entire land from the Russists, we still will have to fight for a while longer... To fight! However, if the victory will be ours in any case, and we are sure of it, then shouldn't we try to implement our formula for peace to save thousands of lives and protect the world from further destabilizations? That is why I want to present our vision of the path to peace - how to actually achieve it. And not only for us, but also for all of you, your allies and partners. In my statement in September of this year at UN General Assembly, I presented Ukraine’s formula for peace. A formula of peace for the world. Just when the world was hoping to recover from the blows of the pandemic, the Russian war provoked a whole series of new global challenges. This must be stopped! There is a set of solutions that need to be implemented. And I want the conversation about it to be public, not behind the scenes. I want it to be discussed in specific terms, and not in broad strokes. Maybe I'll go over the allotted time limit. But the issue of peace is worth it. I want this aggressive Russian war to end justly and on the basis of the UN Charter and international law. Not \"somehow\" - according to the apt formulation of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres. Ukraine should not be offered to conclude compromises with its conscience, sovereignty, territory and independence. We respect the rules and we are people of our word. Ukraine has always been a leader in peacekeeping efforts, and the world has witnessed it. And if Russia says that it supposedly wants to end this war, let it prove it with actions. Apparently, one cannot trust Russia's words, and there will be no Minsks-3, which Russia would violate immediately after signing. If there are no concrete actions to restore peace, it means that Russia simply wants to deceive all of you again, deceive the world and freeze the war just when its defeats have become particularly notable. We will not allow Russia to wait it out, build up its forces, and then start a new series of terror and global destabilization. I am convinced now is the time when the Russian destructive war must and can be stopped. So, here are the proposals of Ukraine: The first is radiation and nuclear safety. No one has the right to blackmail the world with a radioactive disaster. This is an axiom. However, in front of the eyes of the whole world, Russia has turned our Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant into a radioactive bomb that can explode at any moment. Where will the radiation cloud go? Perhaps towards the territory of the EU. Maybe to Türkiye. Maybe to the Middle East. I consider as criminal even a hypothetical possibility of such a scenario! Radiation safety must be restored. The IAEA has already provided respective recommendations, confirming all the risks that we have repeatedly raised. Therefore, Russia must immediately withdraw all its militants from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The station must be immediately transferred to the control of the IAEA and the Ukrainian personnel. The normal connection of the station to the power grid must be restored immediately so that nothing threatens the stability of the reactors. We proposed that IAEA missions are sent to all Ukrainian nuclear plants - four of them, 15 nuclear units in total. Plus the Chornobyl plant, which has been shut down and is under conservation. Such missions can verify that any hostile activity against Ukrainian nuclear facilities has indeed ceased. How long does it take to implement it? Russia can begin the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia NPP as early as tomorrow if it is really ready to restore the radioactive safety it violated. The same goes for the crazy threats of nuclear weapons that Russian officials resort to. There are and cannot be any excuses for nuclear blackmail. And I thank you, dear G-19, for making this clear. However, please use all your power to make Russia abandon nuclear threats. The basis for such efforts can be the Budapest Memorandum and respective capabilities of the signatory states. The second challenge is food security. Thanks to the strong participation of the UN, Türkiye and other partners, we have demonstrated how the cooperation of a few can restore food security for the many. I believe our export grain initiative deserves an indefinite extension - no matter when the war ends. The right to food is a fundamental right of every person in the world. Since July, Ukraine has exported over 10 million tons of food by sea. We can increase exports by several million tons per month. Thus for this I propose to expand the grain export initiative to our other ports - in particular, to the ports of Mykolaiv and \"Olvia\" in the Mykolaiv region. I also call on all countries – and in particular your countries, dear G-19 leaders – to join our initiative to help the poorest with food. We have already launched the initiative – \"Grain From Ukraine\". And the first vessel - Nord Vind - leaves for Ethiopia with 27 thousand tons of wheat on board. This is the amount that can feed almost 100,000 people per year. There can be many such ships from Ukraine, and therefore there will be many people in poor countries who are saved from starvation. Ukraine can export 45 million tons of food this year. And let a significant part of it be directed to those who suffer the most. What do we propose exactly? Each country can join with a specific contribution and become a co-creator of the victory over hunger and the food crisis. The third is energy security. All of you can witness what the Russian terror is aimed at now. This is an attempt to turn the cold into a weapon. A weapon against millions of people. About 40% of our energy infrastructure were destroyed by the strikes of Russian missiles and Iranian drones used by the occupiers. Every week, Russia blows up our power plants, transformers, and electricity supply lines. A related goal of this terror is to prevent the export of our electricity to neighbouring countries, which could significantly help them stabilize the energy situation and reduce prices for consumers. Russia is interested in the energy crisis. And we should all be interested in ending terror. I thank all our partners who have already helped Ukraine with the supply of air defence and missile defence systems. This allows us to shoot down some of the Russian missiles and Iranian drones. But we must fully protect our sky. I ask you to increase respective assistance! We have already proposed that a mission of UN experts is sent to the objects of critical energy infrastructure of Ukraine to assess the scope of damage and the needs for restoration, as well as to prevent their further destruction. We need to speed up the dispatch of this mission! This will be a specific contribution of the international community to the stabilization of the energy situation in Ukraine and Europe, and therefore in the global energy market. However, regardless of the decisions of the world, any day Russia on its own can simply abandon strikes on Ukrainian energy generation and water and heat supply facilities. Let Russia prove by its rejection of terror that it is really interested in the restoration of peace. We must also take a fundamental step so that energy resources are no longer used as weapons. Price restrictions on Russian energy resources should be introduced. If Russia is trying to deprive Ukraine, Europe and all energy consumers in the world of predictability and price stability, the answer to this should be a forced limitation of export prices for Russia. So that the export price was not higher than the production cost. That's fair. If you take something away, the world has the right to take from you. The fourth challenge is the release of all prisoners and deportees. Thousands of our people - military and civilians - are in the Russian captivity. They are subjected to brutal torture - this is mass abuse! In addition, we know by name 11 thousand children who were forcibly deported to Russia. They are separated from their parents in full knowledge that they have families. Apart from the children, whose data we know, there are tens of thousands of those who were forcibly deported and about whom we know only indirectly. Among them are many, whose parents were killed by Russian strikes, and now they are being held in the state that murdered them. Add to that hundreds of thousands of deported adults, and you will see what a humanitarian catastrophe the Russian war has caused. Add political prisoners - Ukrainian citizens who are held in Russia and in the temporarily occupied territory, in particular in Crimea. We must release all these people! I want to point out that we did not find support from the International Committee of the Red Cross. We do not see that they are fully fighting to gain access to the camps, where Ukrainian prisoners of war and political prisoners are held. Neither they are helping to find deported Ukrainians. This self-withdrawal is the self-destruction of the Red Cross as an organization that was once respected. We cannot wait. Therefore, we must unite for the sake of the only realistic model of the release of prisoners - \"all for all\". And also for the release of all children and adults who were deported to Russia. I thank the partners for their efforts, which allowed the release of many Ukrainians and foreign citizens, who were captured by the Russians. And let your leadership and the sincere heart of other leaders, who are present now, help free other Ukrainians as well. The fifth – implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the world order. Article 2 of the UN Charter defines everything very clearly. Everything that Russia violated by this war. Therefore, we must restore the validity of international law - and without any compromises with the aggressor. Because the UN Charter cannot be applied partially, selectively or \"at will\". Russia must reaffirm the territorial integrity of Ukraine within the framework of the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly and the applicable international legally binding documents. It is not up to negotiations. The sixth challenge is withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities. There is a clear understanding of how to achieve this. Russia must withdraw all its troops and armed formations from the territory of Ukraine. Ukraine's control over all sections of our state border with Russia must be restored. This will result in a real and complete cessation of hostilities. Every day of delay means new deaths of Ukrainians, new threats to the world, and an insane increase in losses due to continuation of the Russian aggression – losses for everyone in the world. The seventh – justice. This is what stokes the greatest emotions. Everywhere, when we liberate our land, we see one thing - Russia leaves behind torture chambers and mass burials of murdered people. This was the case in Bucha and other cities in the north of the country after the occupation. This was the case in the Kharkiv region. The same we observe now in the Kherson region. As of today, we have a full information about four hundred and thirty children killed by Russian strikes. Only children! And only those about whom we know everything for sure. And how many mass graves are there in the territory that still remains under the control of Russia? What will we see in Mariupol? That is why the world should endorse establishment of the Special Tribunal regarding the crime of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and the creation of an international mechanism to compensate for all the damages caused by this war. Compensation at the expense of Russian assets, because it is the aggressor who must do everything to restore the justice violated by it. We have already proposed a resolution of the UN General Assembly regarding an international compensation mechanism for damages caused by the Russian war. It is endorsed. We ask you to implement it. We are also preparing the second resolution - on the Special Tribunal. Please join and support it. Because there is no such nation in the world that does not appreciate justice. The eighth challenge is ecocide, the need for immediate protection of environment. Millions of hectares of forest were burned by shelling. Almost two hundred thousand hectares of our land are contaminated with unexploded mines and shells. Dozens of coal mines are flooded, including the mine in which an underground nuclear test explosion was carried out in 1979... This is the “Yunkom” mine in the Donetsk region. It is located on the territory occupied by Russia. It has been flooded for several years - precisely because of the occupiers. Everyone in Moscow knows what a threat it poses not only to the rivers in the Donetsk region, but also to the Black Sea basin. Only the de-occupation of our territory can provide the conditions for the elimination of this threat. It is impossible to accurately calculate the amount of atmospheric pollution from burnt oil depots and other fires... As well as from blown up sewage facilities, burned chemical plants, innumerable burial sites of slayed animals. Just imagine this – due to the Russian aggression, 6 million domestic animals died. 6 million! These are official numbers. At least 50,000 dolphins were killed in the Black Sea. Thousands of hectares of soil are contaminated with harmful substances - most of them are fertile soils. Were fertile soils. During the last week’s Climate Summit in Egypt, I proposed a platform to assess the environmental damage of war. We have to implement it. We must also find common responses to all environmental threats created by the war. Without this, there will be no return to a normal, stable life, and the reverberations of the war will remain for a long time - in the explosions of mines that will take the lives of children and adults, in the pollution of water, soil and atmosphere. I thank all the countries that are already helping us with demining. There is an urgent need for an increased number of equipment and experts for these operations. Funds and technologies are also needed for the restoration of water treatment facilities. This is not just a Ukrainian problem. This is a challenge for the whole world. The next - the ninth – is the prevention of escalation. A risk that still exists and will remain until our security is properly ensured. Ukraine is not a member of any of the alliances. And Russia was able to start this war precisely because Ukraine remained in the grey zone - between the Euro-Atlantic world and the Russian imperialism. Now we do not have any security assurances either. So, how can we prevent repetition of Russia’s such aggression against us? We need effective security assurances. That is why we prepared a draft agreement – the Kyiv Security Compact, and have already presented it to partners. Thus, we should hold an international conference to cement the key elements of the post-war security architecture in the Euro-Atlantic space, including guarantees for Ukraine. The main outcome of the conference should be the signing of the Kyiv Security Compact. We can do it any time - even this year. And we must do it. And the tenth – confirmation of the end of the war. When all the antiwar measures are implemented, when security and justice begin to be restored, a document confirming the end of the war should be signed by the parties. I would like to emphasize that none of the steps above can take long. A month for one step at the most. For some steps, a couple of days are enough. We already have a positive experience with the grain export initiative. How does it work? There is the UN - and two other parties to the agreements: on one side Ukraine, Türkiye and the UN, and on the other side Russia, Türkiye and the UN. Implementation of each of the points I have just presented can be worked out in a similar fashion. States ready to take the lead in this or that decision can become parties to the arrangement. Once again: radiation and nuclear safety; food security; energy security; release of all prisoners and deported persons; implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the world order; withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities; restoration of justice; countering ecocide; preventing escalation; and finally - confirmation of the end of the war. Dear leaders! I have outlined the paths each of you can choose for yourself - how to become a co-creator of peace. Please choose your path for leadership - and together we will surely implement the peace formula. What will it do? It will save thousands of lives. It will restore the validity of international law. It will revitalize the security architecture. It will return the global stability, without which the whole world is suffering. In essence – this is what the honest countries of the world are cooperating for. Peace is a global value. That, which is important for every person in the world. I am confident that it is likewise for each of you, leaders of G-19. I have outlined specific, practical solutions. They can be implemented. Quickly. They are effective. And if Russia opposes our peace formula, you will see that it only wants war. Ukraine is grateful to everyone in the world who helps us to protect freedom and to restore peace. Let our joint efforts be crowned with success as soon as possible and be reflected in the outcomes of this summit. Thank you for the invitation! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Fellow Ukrainians! Today, the enemy launched another massive missile attack on our country. A total of 90 missiles. Energy system, enterprises, and residential buildings were damaged. And when did it happen? As soon as the first day of the G20 summit ended in Indonesia, the most significant statements were made, the key meetings took place. Russia is told about peace, but it fires missiles in response. It is told about the global crises that Russia caused, and it launches Iranian drones in response. It is offered ten points to end the war, and it fires ten missiles per each point about peace. At half past three this morning I joined the summit to present our proposals for restoring international peace and order. The world heard Ukraine. G19 members made their statements... And then in Moscow they decided that they could try again to achieve with terror what they could not and would not be able to achieve for the ninth month. 15:24 - rocket, Kyiv. And throughout the country... How we lived today... 15:54 – rocket, Kropyvnytskyi. 15:56 – two rockets, Kirovohrad region. 15:56 – rocket, Zhytomyr region. And also - Ivano-Frankivsk region, Rivne region, Kharkiv region... 16:29 – rocket, Kryvyi Rih. 16:29 – rocket, Poltava region. 16:35 – Zhytomyr region again. Kyiv region, Lviv region, Odesa region, Mykolaiv region. And also - Volyn, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil region... And again Kyiv. Killed and wounded people. My condolences to the families! In many cities and regions of our country, there are again emergency blackouts. About ten million Ukrainians are without electricity. Most of them - as of this moment - in Kharkiv region, Zhytomyr region, Kyiv region and Lviv region. Lviv and some other cities suspended the supply of heat... All over the country there are problems with communication and the Internet. As a result of the strikes, automation today disabled several nuclear units at two stations - these are calculated consequences, and the enemy knew exactly what he was doing. This is the answer of Russia to Indonesia, India, China and all other countries that talked about the need to end the war. Russia is telling the world that it wants to continue. Now it is time for the world to answer. Moreover, what we warned about a long time ago happened today. We’ve been telling this. Terror is not limited to our national borders. It has already spread to the territory of Moldova. And today, Russian missiles hit Poland, the territory of our friendly country. People died. Please accept condolences from all Ukrainian brothers! How many times has Ukraine said that the terrorist state will not be limited to our country? Poland, the Baltic states... It's only a matter of time before Russian terror goes further. We must put the terrorist in his place! The longer Russia feels impunity, the more threats there will be to everyone who can be reached by Russian missiles. Hitting NATO territory with missiles... This is a Russian missile attack on collective security! This is a really significant escalation. Action is needed. And I want to tell all our Polish brothers and sisters now... Ukraine will always support you! Terror will not break free people! Victory is possible when there is no fear! We don't have it, neither do you. I want to thank all partners who help protect the sky. In particular, our NASAMS systems worked well today: ten hits out of ten launches. As of this hour, more than 70 missiles and 10 combat drones have been shot down. I thank all our American and European friends who help us ensure such a result. I am also grateful to all our warriors of the \"South\", \"Center\", \"East\" and \"West\" air commands, as well as air defense units of the Ground Forces. I am grateful to all our rescuers, our energy workers who will work round the clock to restore normal life for Ukrainians. Restoration work has begun across the country. We will get through this too. We will restore everything. Russia opposes itself to the world. Russia loses on the battlefield. Russia terrorizes us and everyone it can reach. Let's do everything to stop it! Glory to all who defend freedom! Glory to all who work for our victory! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by terrorists! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you very much, Mr. President Widodo. Dear colleagues! Yesterday at our summit, everyone talked about how to end the Russian war. The Russian representative even made some comments... And after that, almost 100 Russian missiles hit Ukraine. Burnt residential buildings. Destroyed power plants again. Hundreds of cities were left without electricity, water and heat. Internet traffic has fallen by two-thirds – imagine the scale. Unfortunately, there are human casualties. And not only in Ukraine! Russian missiles hit the territory of neighboring Poland yesterday. There should be a quick response. This missile attack is Russia's real performance at G20. So when I say G19, I'm not wrong. Because Russia is a terrorist, and we protect ourselves from it. Such is the reality. And I urge you to look at today's panel of our Digital Transformation Summit from a security perspective. This will be a timely view. Dear leaders, you now clearly see what modern war is. Today, it is impossible to imagine life without computer networks, high-speed communication, the Internet, and even more so - without electricity. But your enemies may try to deprive you of just that. My good advice to you is to take Ukrainian defense experience in order to guarantee the safety of your people. We have created an IT army that prevails in cyberspace. The best specialists and companies of the country have united to protect the state. We repelled more than 1,300 cyberattacks during the 8 months of the Russian war. In the first week of the invasion, Russia destroyed a key data center of our country, and the response solution is the \"clouds\" into which we moved part of the information systems. We have built the protection of public registers. We have preserved the digital resilience of banks. Thanks to digitization, we can quickly organize social payments to those affected by hostilities. Millions of Ukrainians use our Diia state service every day. These are more than 100 public services without contact with officials. A digital passport, opening accounts, paying fines and taxes, receiving state aid, raising funds to support the army... All this is Ukrainian \"Diia\". If you or your allies and partners do not already have such a system and such digital protection, we will be happy to help you build them! Cyber defense is about cooperation. The stability of institutions is cooperation. Reliable communication, including satellite communication, is also about cooperation. What we all need is to put aside disputes and develop collective efforts for global peace. The G19 can be very successful in this! Ukraine is willing to help. Our security experience is your security experience. And please remember that everything must now be considered from the point of view of security. Thank you Mr. President Widodo for a very meaningful summit! Thank you all for your support! Let there be peace! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today was a long and hard day. And now, in the evening, it seems that the events of the morning happened at least yesterday or the day before yesterday... The summit in Indonesia. I took part in today's work of the leaders. Then – another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, discussion in detail. The situation at the front. Also, the military presented all the available data on the missile hitting the territory of Poland. Everyone responsible for liquidating the consequences of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine reported on the recovery work. Recovery does not stop for a minute. Emergency blackouts and stabilization outages continue in 18 regions and the city of Kyiv. These are millions of consumers. We are doing everything to restore electricity – both generation and supply. Another meeting of the \"Ramstein\" defense group took place. The key issue is the strengthening of our anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense. I held negotiations with the vice president of the World Bank, who is responsible for our region. We discussed projects for the reconstruction of our infrastructure and social facilities, the work of the Recovery Fund of our country. The total cost of projects discussed today is billions of dollars. This is something that needs to be rebuilt now to guarantee a normal life for people. There were reports on the liberation of the territories of Kherson region – we are doing everything to provide people with electricity, water, communications, financial and social services, and normal medicine as soon as possible. Pharmacies are finally reopening in Kherson, the post office, banks are working. People are getting access to the Internet. There are already 30 humanitarian aid distribution points. Electricity was restored to more than 20 de-occupied settlements in Kherson region. Mykolaiv region is the same. We return everything necessary for a normal life. We are working to restore the water supply to Mykolaiv. Payment of pensions has started in Snihurivka. And I thank everyone who provides recovery. And especially our sappers and rescuers. Thanks to their work everyone else can work safely. Once again, I will repeat to everyone in the de-occupied territory: please be very careful! Russia wants to kill even after fleeing from our land. Therefore, you need to be very careful. If you see anything suspicious, report it to the emergency services and the police. If a building has not yet been checked by sappers, please do not enter it. If a road has not been checked yet, please skip it. Reports and messages from Donetsk region are unchanged. Fierce battles continue at the same points as before. We hold our positions despite dozens of attacks. Of course, there was a lot of international communication. Not everything can be talked about now. We protect the interests of Ukraine, as always. Today is the professional day of thousands of our people who perform one of the most important jobs. And this is not only the work to inform people. The Day of Radio, Television and Communication Workers is about those who strengthen democracy at all times. Who integrates society informationally, emotionally and politically. Who unites our interests, our pain and our joys, our hopes and aspirations, our problems. The stronger this sphere is in the country, the stronger the democracy is there. I sincerely congratulate everyone who works in this field – each one. Those who make a telethon and those who work on other information platforms. Presenters, reporters whom we see and hear, studio workers, producers, editorial staff, whom society usually does not see and hear, but without whom this industry simply would not exist. Thank you all for your work for Ukrainians! Today there was a rather long interview. I also held an \"off the record\" meeting for journalists – specifically for radio and television workers. And the day is not over yet... There is also a meeting of the UN Security Council regarding the new wave of Russian missile terror. We are monitoring statements, working with partners, and defending Ukrainian interests. Of course, one of the main issues at the Security Council meeting is the situation in Poland, the clarification of all the circumstances of how Russian aggression crossed the Polish border. The Ukrainian position is very transparent: we strive to establish all the details, every fact. That is why we need our specialists to join the work of the international investigation and to get access to all the data available to our partners and the site of the explosion. All our information is in full access, we have been giving it to our partners since the night, from those first hours when the world began to find out what happened. I spoke with President Duda last night and expressed my condolences to him – Russian aggression took the lives of two Polish citizens. And I want all of us to honor the memory of all those whose lives were taken by this Russian war with a minute of silence. Citizens of Ukraine, citizens of Poland..."

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for your attention to Ukraine! Our communication today actually finalizes the work of your Forum, it is symbolic. Symbolic, because the global situation directly depends on when and how the Russian aggression will end. Look at how many threats and crises for everyone in the world have been provoked by this aggression. I will give three examples now, but there are more - much more. Another Russian terrorist attack has just taken place, in the morning - dozens of missiles, civilian objects are the main target. Russia is fighting against electricity and heat for people, blowing up power plants and other energy facilities. This is everyday life in Ukraine now - because of Russian terror. That is why we put so much effort into getting modern air defense and anti-missile defense systems from our partners. Plus constant hostilities on the frontline more than a thousand kilometers long. What does this mean from a global perspective? Instead of investing trillions of dollars in the development of human capital, the world will spend colossal amounts of money on rearmament - in addition to those already planned. You will see. Now everyone is paying close attention to how we defend ourselves in Ukraine. They look - which weapons are the best, which tactics work, which defense systems give the maximum result. To be honest, few countries could now defend themselves against aggression as intensively as we do. So many shells and weapons are simply non-existent. But there are still more potential aggressors in the world and frozen conflicts that can flare up again than such countries. Hence, there is an insane security deficit. Therefore, the more forms of terror Russia will use in this war, the more funds the world will eventually direct to weapons and to defense against a potential repetition of such attacks as we are experiencing. Another example... Instead of paying maximum attention to the green transformation, various governments are equally looking for ways to guarantee cheaper supplies of oil, gas, and coal in order to lower energy prices. It is the price of energy, not the purity of energy, that is the number 1 issue for many. And it wouldn't be like that if it weren't for Russian aggression - and Russia's use of energy resources as a weapon. The third example... In just a few weeks, the threat of starvation for tens of millions of people arose completely artificially. Not because of a drought or an economic crisis, but because of the military blockade of our ports - a food exporting country. The world has not seen anything like this for decades. Any new disaster in one or another country due to high food prices or, God forbid, due to famine, is minus years for global development. Many different topics were discussed at your Forum during these days... But how many of them do not depend on what Russian aggression has brought and, unfortunately, can still bring? Minority. Therefore, when Ukraine offers a peace formula, it is really a peace formula not just for us, but for the world. When the threat is complex, the response must be complex as well. Nothing can be solved by simply ceasing fire. This is our formula. We need to restore peace - reliably and for the long term. You will not restore stability by simply mitigating the crises provoked by Russia. Every threat must be completely dismantled. The other day, at the summit in Indonesia, I presented exactly such proposals of ours - reliable peace and complete dismantling of Russian threats. And I thank everyone who supports the Ukrainian peace formula. And now I want to add one more component. What does peace mean? It's very practical, actually. This is saving lives. Stabilization. Development. Development! Already now, by joining the reconstruction of Ukraine, various countries and companies are receiving incentives for growth. But when we restore territorial integrity and guarantee reliable peace, Ukraine will become a powerful source of new global development. And it's not just about the economy. It’s about the modern economy. I will give you three more examples. Ukraine is able to replace dirty fossil fuels from Russia with clean energy. We have huge potential in low-carbon energy. Ukraine is capable of becoming a key partner of the European Union for the purposes of decarbonization. We will become one of the main suppliers of green hydrogen and green electricity in the EU. Climatic conditions of Ukraine, free space, solar energy, wind energy will allow the production of green electricity with a very competitive cost. Just three years before the Russian invasion, we built 7 gigawatts of renewable energy. The potential is many times more. Plus, Ukraine can produce tens of millions of tons of green and cheap ammonia. Plus, strong positions in bioenergy. Plus, powerful nuclear energy and energy infrastructure, which is integrated with the energy grid of the European Union. Now the Russian missile terror is targeted primarily at these our facilities. Only the day before yesterday, Russia fired almost a hundred missiles against our energy facilities in one day. Almost a hundred! Today again... Of course, the losses are great. But this only means that the reconstruction will be large-scale. I invite your countries and companies to already assess the prospects and join our reconstruction. By the way, we now have the decision of one of the largest Australian private investment groups, which has committed to invest the first 500 million dollars specifically in the Green Growth Initiative of Ukraine as part of the creation of the $25 billion Recovery Fund. I am grateful to Mr. Andrew Forrest for the decision to be the first, and also to Mr. Larry Fink of BlackRock for helping to structure this Fund. Another example is resource extraction. The modern economy needs lithium, graphite and other rare earth metals. We have the largest reserves of some of these resources in Europe. These are already colossal opportunities. Plus production and transport capabilities, plus our potential in mechanical engineering, our work culture and access to the world's leading markets - this is the basis for exactly the economic growth that everyone so desperately needs. The third is the agricultural sector. The world saw that it is impossible to guarantee global food security without Ukrainian exports. Our export grain initiative already helps with stabilization. And a decision has just been made to extend it by 120 days. But Ukraine's proposal is to extend the Black Sea Initiative indefinitely. This is vital for stability. Plus, we founded the Grain From Ukraine program to provide together with our partners as much food aid to the poorest countries as possible. But the return of peace to Ukraine will mean that we will be able not only to stabilize the market in response to the crisis, but to guarantee food stability and the prevention of any crises. And again, I gave only three examples, and there are many more. Peace in Ukraine is a global need. I emphasize - not a temporary lull, not an illusion of peace, which Russia tempts with to simply prepare a new stage of aggression, but real peace. I know it can be achieved. But for this we need to preserve global unity - and continue to support our struggle for freedom. It is necessary to preserve global integrity - and increase pressure on Russia for terror. And it is necessary to preserve global rationality - and cooperate with us for the sake of future development already now. Once again, thank you for your attention! And let there be reliable peace. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we have important international results. Our export grain initiative has been extended. Despite all the difficulties, despite various manipulations by Russia, we will continue to export agricultural products through our Black Sea ports. This is a very specific thing that makes the world see the importance of Ukraine. Since August 1, more than 450 ships have already left the ports of Great Odesa. The total amount of food is 11 million tons. The geography is very broad: Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Yemen, Lebanon, Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Türkiye, as well as the countries of the European Union. Tens of millions of people, primarily in African countries, have been saved from starvation, in particular by means of deliveries in the framework of the UN World Food Programme from our ports. We also managed to reduce the pressure on the global food market. And this means that food prices are significantly lower than they would be without our food exports. We have done everything to expand this work. And I thank all our partners who are helping: the UN and Secretary-General Guterres personally, Türkiye and President Erdoğan personally. Thanks to everyone in our team who is responsible for this direction. This is a truly important result. Today, a meeting was held in the Office regarding our Grain from Ukraine initiative. We have the consent of such countries as Germany, Poland, Belgium, Japan, Türkiye and the USA to join the work of the initiative. But these are the countries that have already made up their mind. There will be more participating countries. The meaning is very simple and as specific as possible. All the countries of the world, together with Ukraine, can ensure the supply of food for those in the world who suffer the most from food shortages. We will provide more details on how this will work shortly. I believe that this Russian aggression should lead the whole world to an obvious conclusion: never again should there be mass famine in the world. If the world works in unity, famine will be defeated. A very important decision was adopted today in the Netherlands. There is the first sentence for the murderers who destroyed the Malaysian Boeing in the sky over Donbas in 2014. Three men were sentenced to life imprisonment. And the day will surely come when they will begin to serve this punishment. But this decision is not just about three murderers. Russia lied a lot about this catastrophe, but nevertheless the key facts were established. Now the perpetrators have been convicted and the basis is provided to convict the culprits of a higher level, too. Those who bear full personal responsibility for the crime of aggression against Ukraine - the original crime that gave rise to all the others committed by the Russists since 2014.  This is something without which it is impossible to protect the world from the repetition of such wars as Russian aggression against our state. When all the murderers and torturers are convicted, when their commanders and political \"cover\" face fair sentences, when Russia compensates for all the damage caused by Russian aggression, it will be a very solid foundation for a lasting peace. We have all the possibilities to ensure this. Every Russian war crime, every terrorist attack of theirs will receive its legal response. Today's decision in The Hague proves it. The elimination of the consequences of another missile attack against Ukraine continues all day... Again, there are emergency shutdowns in addition to planned, stabilization ones. Currently, more than 10 million Ukrainians are without electricity. Most of them are in the Vinnytsia region, Odesa region, Sumy region and Kyiv. We are doing everything to normalize the supply. In Dnipro, dozens of people were injured as a result of a missile attack. Everyone is provided with aid. In Zaporizhzhia, the clearance of the rubble of a residential building, which was destroyed by Russian shelling at night, continues... The list of the dead includes seven people. Unfortunately, this number may increase. Only in the first half of today, our defense forces managed to shoot down six Russian cruise missiles and five Shaheds. Unfortunately, not all of those launched by terrorists. We repeat to our partners again and again that only full protection of the Ukrainian sky will protect both Ukraine and Europe from many possible escalations of Russian aggression and will definitely encourage Russia to truly end the war. Not to the kind of propaganda that now sounds from the Kremlin about the alleged readiness for negotiations in order to buy some time and gather forces for a new offensive, but to real peace. I would like to thank Finland and Sweden today for the decisions regarding the new defense assistance packages. This is very important. Each such decision of the states makes them co-creators of our victory and future peace. Today I signed several decrees on awarding our warriors. 402 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were honored with state awards. In total, since February 24, more than 32,000 Ukrainian men and women have been awarded for bravery in battles. 4950 of them - posthumously. We must always remember how many people gave their lives to save Ukraine and freedom. Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russian aggression! Glory to all who gain victory for Ukraine! Gratitude to everyone who helps us and works for the state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear friends! Mr. Minister, Mr. President, dear students! I am glad to see you! While preparing for this meeting, I learned that Russia has recently imposed sanctions against 52 political figures of your country. And for what? For the fact that your country supports European efforts to end Russian terror and to revive international law. Of course, the restrictions imposed by Russia do not particularly affect anything. This is more of a propaganda thing, so that on Russian television they can lie that Russia is allegedly capable of something in diplomacy. But after seeing this message about your 52 politicians, I remembered another number - 52, and a recent one too. And also the one that is related to sanctions. As you know, the summit of the countries with the largest economies just took place in Indonesia. And the participants of the summit agreed on a joint declaration - exactly 52 points. Quite meaningful - they reflect many existing global problems. Formally, Russia also supported the declaration, but in reality, it violates most of the things contained in the declaration. And some of the acute global problems that the \"twenty\" declares to solve are deliberately created by Russia. That is, after carefully reading these 52 points of the Bali Declaration, you can see why international pressure on Russia, particularly sanctions, should be not only maintained, but also intensified. Russia continues to destroy international relations and people's lives, and pretends that it is fighting against this destabilization together with everyone. This is from the fourth point of the declaration: \"It is important to uphold international law and the multilateral system that guarantees peace and stability... Today's era must not be an era of war.\" And this is when Russia mobilized all resources to not only turn our time into a time of war, but to become the largest terrorist state in history. Point five of the declaration - Russia says that it will allegedly, together with others, take measures to promote energy stability and market stability. And at the same time, when this summit in Indonesia is still going on, Russia is carrying out a missile attack against our country. Almost a hundred missiles - specifically against the energy sphere. Another missile attack the next day. And not only against power plants, but also against gas production facilities. This is energy stability in Russian. The thirteenth point of the Bali Declaration is about combating climate change. Russia allegedly confirms the protection of the natural environment, but it has already destroyed almost three million hectares of forests in our country with its aggression! They were burned by shelling. And this is only one of thousands of crimes committed by Russia against the environment. Point 22 of the declaration - \"Countries will make every effort for timely access to vaccines, therapeutic and diagnostic tools.\" And in fact, hundreds of hospitals were destroyed by Russian shelling. In most of the territory occupied by Russia, there is no access to medicine at all. Even to the simplest medicines, to surgical operations, to insulin... And this is in Europe. In 2022. And this is the case for almost all 52 points of the Bali Declaration. You read and see the scale of Russia’s lies and that it is now the biggest threat to the world. I will add point 44. It specifically states: \"Access to education is a human right and a key tool for inclusive and sustainable economic recovery.\" Do you know how many educational institutions in Ukraine the Russian army destroyed in 9 months of war? 2,719 were shelled, and 332 were completely destroyed. These are universities, schools... Dear friends! Russian aggression does not stop for a single day. Just as Russian lies to the world never stop. Therefore, for all this, the international pressure on Russia should not stop for a single day. And this can be done not only by politicians, but also by everyone at their own level. Of course, new sanctions should be applied against Russia. It is effective. A new European sanctions package is needed. Please defend this need at the pan-European level. We must be active in spreading the truth about the war and the crises provoked by it. This is something that all of you can definitely do. Please talk about what is happening and find a format convenient for you to support honest media or bloggers who cover global affairs and, in particular, Russian aggression. And please look for specific projects that can help our defense and our people. The more collective efforts are made, the sooner we will force Russia to leave the territory of Ukraine and fulfill its obligations to the world. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support, Ireland! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! All day long, the energy staff worked to restore the normal technical possibility of electricity supply, as a result today there are already significantly fewer emergency shutdowns. As of the evening, in most regions where shutdowns continue, stabilization hourly schedules were in effect. Emergency shutdowns were used to a greater extent in the Odesa region and Kyiv. The difficult situation with energy supply persists in a total of 17 regions and in the capital. Kyiv region and Kyiv, it’s very difficult in the Odesa region, and also the Vinnytsia region and Ternopil region. Special \"Points of Invincibility\" were opened in Kherson today. The first two points. There will be more. While electricity is restored in the city, people can charge their phones, stay warm, drink tea and get help. We have provided communication service there, there are \"Starlinks\", etc. We know that it is very difficult for people, because the occupiers destroyed everything before fleeing. But we will connect everything, restore everything. Vice-President of the European Commission Dombrovskis was in Kyiv today. We talked with him, in particular, about energy. Financial cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union, the financing needs of our country until the end of the year and in the next year were also discussed in detail. This year, we expect two tranches of macro-financial aid - EUR 2.5 billion in November and EUR 0.5 billion in early December. We also discussed new sanctions against Russia, which may be introduced at the European level. I spoke today with the student community of Ireland - a country that supports us fundamentally. Although it is a neutral country militarily, Ireland strongly defends European values and helps us politically and humanitarianly. I made two requests to the Irish. The first is to promote at the pan-European level the need to strengthen sanctions against Russia. The second is to help us spread the truth about the events in Ukraine and about Russian terror. I also addressed the participants of the security forum in Halifax, Canada, which is one of the world's security forums. Once again, I presented the Ukrainian peace formula and invited Canada and our other partners to choose for themselves a component of the peace formula in which they can show their leadership as much as possible. This is the point of the way we present our proposals for restoring peace. We have broken them down into elements - what Russian aggression consists of. And we do everything to neutralize each of these elements and to neutralize the aggressor because of it. Every day, I receive very positive feedback from the world about this approach of ours - major leaders support Ukrainian constructiveness. And I believe that we will be able to implement our peace formula. The fierce fighting in the Donetsk region continues to this day, there has been no alleviation of hostilities or respite. About a hundred Russian attacks were repelled in the Donetsk region only yesterday. All our warriors who are holding out in Donbas are true heroes. Today, I would like to pay particular attention to the border guards of the Kharkiv and Sumy detachments, who are currently operating in the Donetsk region. Their mortars help a lot, giving the invaders no rest. Nice job, guys! Thank you! I also thank the warriors of the 4th operational brigade of the National Guard, which protects Ukraine in the direction of Bakhmut. Smart initiative and persistence are two things that produce extremely useful results. Nowhere on the frontline do we give in to the enemy. We respond everywhere, we hold positions everywhere. We are preparing future successes in certain areas. I spoke today with the President of Türkiye Erdoğan. Thanked him for the efforts to extend our grain export initiative. We also discussed the details of our new humanitarian initiative Grain from Ukraine. I hope that Türkiye will join its implementation. Of course, attention was paid to both security cooperation and energy situation. Tomorrow we will have a very active day, not a day off at all. We are expecting news and opportunities for Ukraine. And we are already preparing the appropriate soil for them. And today I want to say one more thing - congratulations. Congratulations to all sergeants of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on their professional day. Today, many kind words were said both in the army and in society. Sergeants are truly the people who ensure real unity and understanding between commanders and soldiers. The sergeant corps is the true backbone of the Army, and I thank all of our sergeants who live up to those words. Thank you to each and everyone who is currently serving in our defense forces! Thank you to everyone who made the defense of Ukraine a part of their personal destiny! Glory to our heroes! Eternal memory and honor to those who gave their lives for the freedom of Ukrainians! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear friends! Maybe most of the discussions at this year`s forum will address one question – how to end the Russian war.  But I will ask you to formulate a more precise question – how to restore real and just peace. Simply the end of the war does not guarantee peace. Russia is now looking for a short truce – a respite to regain strength. Someone may call this the war`s end. But such a respite will only worsen the situation. Any voiced ideas of our land`s concessions or of our sovereignty cannot be called peace. Immoral compromises will lead to new blood. A truly real, long-lasting and honest peace can only be the result of the complete demolition of Russian aggression. There are 10 items in the Ukrainian Peace Formula. These are challenges which should be overcome for the sake of security of Ukraine, Europe and the world. This is the Peace Formula for the world. Ukraine proposed precisely such a Peace Formula. I presented it to the UN General Assembly and the G20 Summit. And I am asking you to help us implement this formula! This is the only way to real peace. First item is radiation and nuclear safety. The second one is food security. The third is energy security. The fourth is the release of all war prisoners and deportees. The fifth is the implementation of the UN Charter and the restoration of our territorial integrity and world order. The sixth is the pull out of Russian troops and the end of hostilities. The seventh is the restoration of justice, namely the Tribunal for those guilty of aggression crime, and – damages compensation. The eighth is countering ecocide. Ninth are the security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent escalation. And the tenth is the confirmation of the war`s end. What is the goal of such approach?  We emphasize on all of the elements of Russian aggression, and offer our partners to demolish all aspects of aggression together with us in order to provide security. That is something where each of our partners can show their leadership. We have already succeeded in some things, for example, we extended the grain export initiative and offer a new humanitarian initiative – Grain From Ukraine to enhance food security. In the same way, we can go step by step in other items of our Peace Formula. I suggest you, dear Forum participants, to choose the possible leadership options for your countries. Each item of our Peace Formula has the proposals for particular solutions. Please choose which item you can help with. I believe that Canada, which strongly supports us, will also choose one of the Peace Formula items for itself and will show all the strength of its leadership. I assure you that peace is possible! But for it to exist, we must make impossible Russian aggression – all of its elements. Let it happen! Let there be peace! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I briefly report on the day, which started very early today, it was very active, and my schedule for this day is not yet exhausted. I just held another meeting of the Staff. The main issues are the front. The provision of our troops, the situation in particular sections of the front line and that we are planning to increase the number of Ukrainian flags in the cities in the south and east of the country. The battles in Donetsk region were discussed separately. Reports were presented. We are doing everything to help our heroes withstand Russian attacks. Of course, special attention was paid to energy. The composition of the participants of the Staff meeting is traditional. The Commander-in-Chief, commanders and all who work for our defense. An extremely important visit to Ukraine took place today – the visit of the new British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak. A very meaningful visit. We managed to discuss all the key issues of our relations. There will be new results for both our countries – that's for sure. Thank you, Rishi, Mr. Prime Minister, for your willingness to defend freedom even more strongly with us. We also have some very necessary decisions – we agreed on them today. As always, today I received reports on restoration work in the energy sector. We are working throughout the country to stabilize the situation. The most problems with electricity are in the city of Kyiv and Kyiv region, the city of Odesa and Odesa region, the city of Kharkiv and Kharkiv region. Vinnytsia, Ternopil, Cherkasy, Chernihiv and other regions – energy workers are doing everything possible to give people a normal life. Kherson – we are restoring transport connections. There is the first train from Kyiv. We create new opportunities for people every day. We are preparing important international events – they will be soon. We will provide everything that is needed for our protection. We involve everyone who can be involved in supporting our state. Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thanks to everyone in the world who helps! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear friends! Dear leaders! I want to tell you now about a typical day in our country. Unfortunately, typical... And not through our fault. A day of this week. Ask yourself: what have you been busy with this Tuesday? What were you worried about? What did you feel? For Ukraine, this Tuesday is almost a hundred missile strikes. A hundred different missiles against our cities. Against residential buildings. Against enterprises. Against power plants. Do you know what this missile strike is? It’s more than 20 million people without electricity. Such was the damage to the power system, such was the urgent emergency shutdown. The reactors at two of our nuclear power plants also shut down due to missile damage to the energy industry. Ladies and Gentlemen! You all know what a terrible war Russia is waging against Ukraine. You all know how we want to restore peace. All of you could hear what we have to offer for this. The Ukrainian peace formula is very clear, and each of its points has been thoroughly worked out. Radiation and nuclear safety. Food security. Energy security. Release of all prisoners and deportees. Implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the world order. Withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities. Restoring justice. Countering ecocide. Prevention of escalation. Fixing the end of the war. Each of these points are specific decisions, what needs to be done for security. Russian aggression will not simply stop – stability and predictability will be restored for everyone in the world. That is why our formula for peace is a formula for peace for the world. And I suggest to all leaders, to all conscientious countries, to choose the element of the peace formula that you can help us implement. Ukraine really wants peace. But in order to restore peace, we need support. That is why I am turning to you now. Ukraine always helps. Dozens of countries in the world, whose security directly depends on cooperation with Ukraine, know this for sure. This year it was confirmed again. When Russia blocked the Black Sea and our ports, hundreds of millions of people in various countries found themselves on the brink of an acute food crisis. When we managed to restore our exports and return millions of tons of Ukrainian agricultural products to the food market, a sense of stability finally began to appear. That is why it is so important that we stop Russian aggression. This is not just about our country, which Russia is trying to take over. It's not just about our land and resources that Russia wants to appropriate. It's about something more. About stability for everyone in the world. This is about our common radiation safety - so that not a single Russian missile hits our nuclear power plants. This is about our common energy security - so that the destabilization of energy markets, which Russia uses as a weapon, finally stops. This is about our common food security - so that people have basic food on their tables. Peace in Ukraine is peace for you too. Today is the 270th day of the full-scale war. Russia used more than 4,700 missiles. Hundreds of our cities are simply burned. Thousands of people died. Hundreds of thousands were forcibly deported to Russia. Millions left Ukraine for other countries, fleeing the war. We have to stop it. We must stop Russian aggression. I always say this: the return of peace is possible! But it is possible when everyone in the world understands that no one in the world deserves a single day of terror. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! This day is coming to an end - already the 270th day of the full-scale war. I will report briefly. The first topic is the frontline. The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there are fewer attacks today due to the deterioration of the weather, the number of Russian shelling occasions remains, unfortunately, extremely high. Luhansk region - little by little we are moving forward with battles. As of now, there have been almost 400 shelling occasions in the east since the beginning of the day. Thank you to each and everyone who holds positions and helps our defense forces. South - we are holding the line, consistently and very calculatedly destroying the potential of the occupiers. The second topic is energy. Restoration of networks and technical supply capabilities, demining of power transmission lines, repairs - everything goes on round the clock. We managed to alleviate the situation in some regions where there were a lot of real problems yesterday. This evening there are stabilization shutdowns in 15 regions and in Kyiv as well. The largest are Vinnytsia, Sumy, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv regions and the capital. We are doing everything possible and impossible to return normal life to Odesa, Kharkiv and all our cities and communities. And I thank all energy workers, utility workers, regional administrations - everyone who works for the sake of Ukrainians. The third topic is foreign policy. Today I addressed the participants of the summit of the  International Organization of La Francophonie. These are more than 50 participating countries, and more than 20 observer countries. Africa, Asia, America, Europe - everywhere they hear Ukraine, everywhere they know our proposals on how to restore peace to Ukraine and how to restore stability to the world. I will say right away that the Ukrainian peace formula is perceived extremely positively in the world. It is quite constructive and realistic - in contrast to the empty and mendacious Russian rhetoric about their alleged readiness for some kind of negotiations. We will do everything to make the world accept the Ukrainian peace formula. There will be several important international addresses in the upcoming week. And we are already preparing. And one more thing. Traditionally, the Day of Agricultural Workers is celebrated in Ukraine on the third Sunday of November. Was there ever an international context to this day? This year it’s definitely there. This year, many people in the world saw how important the contribution of Ukrainians to global food security is. The lives of millions of people in different countries directly depend on our agricultural sector. I thank all our people who work on the ground, who provide Ukraine and the world with the essentials. Thanks to you and your work, we can find support for our state in those countries with which we do not yet have traditional relations. But we will have them, trust me. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to everyone who works and helps! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Fellow Ukrainians! Today we celebrate the Day of Dignity and Freedom. A holiday that shows that for us dignity and freedom is a holiday. The answer to the question of who Ukrainians are and what is most important to them. Dear people! I said these words in the same place on the same day exactly one year ago. What has changed since then? A lot. In our country, Europe and the whole world. But something remains unchanged. This is the answer to the question of who Ukrainians are and what is most important to us. Two values, inextricably intertwined, like the right and left banks of the Dnipro River. Like blue and yellow colors. Like Chubynsky’s words and Verbytsky’s music. Like two threads of a pattern on a vyshyvanka where our genetic code is encrypted. This is dignity and freedom. We always remembered this and have no right to forget. We always valued this and are not afraid to defend this. We always knew what we wanted. And this year, everyone found out what we are capable of. Friends and enemies saw it. Allies and partners. We saw for ourselves. Someone - once again. Someone - for the first time. But all together we proved and continue to prove that dignity and freedom are a holiday for us. This remained unchanged. And everyone saw what Ukrainians are capable of. Everyone saw what defenders we have. How to hold out against one of the greatest armies in the world and become one of the best armies in the world. Someone will say: it sounds loud. Yes. Our army sounds loud. For the last eight years. And for the last nine months. When hardened fighters are joined by musicians, actors, Olympic champions, IT specialists, scientists, businessmen. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who did not get on the plane, but stood in line at the military commissariat. And side by side they stood up for our dream. Free Ukraine forever. And everyone saw what our civilians are capable of. Everyone saw what kind of citizens we have! How can you become a living wall on the path of the occupier's military columns, stop and turn around enemy tanks and armored personnel carriers with bare hands. Go to rallies under the occupation despite the gunshots and stun grenades. Preserve the Ukrainian flag and wait to finally meet the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Flood your village to prevent the orcs from entering Kyiv. Shoot down a Russian drone with a can. Give seeds to the occupiers so that sunflowers sprout in the place where they perish. And everyone saw what kind of doctors, firefighters, rescuers, railway workers, energy workers, and farmers we have. How can you be on duty for several weeks in a row. Pull dozens of wounded from the battlefield. Carry out surgeries under bombs and bullets. Sow a crop and gather it as a harvest under bombs and bullets. Give lectures to students online, in the trenches. Get a bachelor's degree online, in the trenches. Everyone saw what kind of volunteers and caring people we have. How can you raise funds for drones, ambulance vehicles, optics, thermal imagers in a matter of hours. How to get everything. Buy everything. Bring everything. And then get, buy and bring again, because that wasn't all. And in every village, people canned borscht and stewed meat for the frontline, because we would go red with embarrassment if our warriors ate expired dry ration, like orcs. We are willing to give the last we have so that the Ukrainian warrior looks decently. Fights decently. Wins decently. And everyone saw what kind of business we have. Not oligarchs, but a modern, creative, humane and responsible business. How to turn your office, hotel or gym into a shelter for IDPs. How fashion shoe brands manufacture army boots. Designers of women's dresses manufacture body armor. A garden furniture manufacturer makes anti-tank hedgehogs. A famous model cooks food for warriors and refugees. A TV presenter makes a \"Bandera smoothie\". A doctor of science sorts humanitarian aid in Poland. And an opera singer evacuates hundreds of people in his car. Everyone saw what kind of children we have. How they give up smartphones and gadgets to donate money to the army. How they wash cars and sell drawings, collecting money for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. How a boy runs away from home to enroll in the territorial defense. How a girl with shot legs drives a car 15 kilometers to take out four wounded adults. Everyone saw what kind of people we have! Willing to give the last. Willing to stand to the last. They did not lose dignity. Bravery. Faith in themselves. And they united. In order not to lose freedom. Not to lose independence. Not to lose Ukraine. We can be left without money. Without gasoline. Without hot water. Without light. But not without freedom. And it remains unchanged. Yes, we have paid and continue to pay a very high price for freedom. And we will never forget all those who gave their lives for Ukraine. And we will never forgive everyone who took away their lives and wanted to take away our freedom. But the main thing is that no one succeeded and no one will ever succeed. Dear people! I said these words in the same place on the same day exactly one year ago. What has changed since then? A lot. Craters appeared on our land. There are roadblocks and anti-tank hedgehogs in our cities and villages. It may be dark on our streets. It may be cold in our homes. There are many changes, but they have not changed the most important thing. Because the most important thing is not outside, but inside. And it remains unchanged. And that's why we will hold out. We will endure. Everyone. Different. But Ukrainian men and women. Defenders. Everyone who knows: we must be worthy, we must not give up. Because Ukrainians are not used to giving up. Because they have dignity. And therefore - freedom! This remains unchanged. We will overcome everything. Endure. Survive. Prevail! And on the Day of Dignity and Freedom, we will gather on Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Where dignity and freedom have always been protected. On the granite, on the barricades during the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity. Where we celebrated the 30th anniversary of Ukraine's independence. And where we will celebrate the Victory Day of Ukraine. In a peaceful Kyiv, in a peaceful Ukraine, I will speak about the important. About the main thing. What remained unchanged. And will remain unchanged. Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mr. President of the Assembly! Dear attendees! Dear representatives of Spain and all other countries of the Alliance! Dear friends! I am glad to see you and thank you for all the kind words that have just been spoken and will be spoken in the Assembly in our support - in support of the struggle for freedom. Today, Ukraine marks the ninth anniversary of the beginning of Maidan - the Revolution of Dignity. In those months of 2013-2014, when Ukrainians in the squares and streets of our cities defended the right to European choice for our state, an important thing happened for our entire community - a community of nations united by the values of freedom, respect for law, democracy and diversity. Ukrainians filled with a powerful life force what many began to think was just a bureaucratic formality. Ukrainians and all people in Europe, in America, in the world, who supported us and continue to support us, filled the flag of the European Union with new energy. And in fact, with the way we defend freedom in Ukraine, we united both the European Union and NATO. We showed the commonality of challenges and proved the commonality of values. Ladies and Gentlemen! Although Ukraine has not yet become a full-fledged part of the EU and NATO, I am addressing you on behalf of the people who have always been, are and will be part of the valuable space to which you all belong. History brought us to different sides of ideological walls. But the walls fell, and our values are all preserved. And not only me, but millions of our people and the majority of citizens of your states support the European and Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine. Now, when we are defending European values ​​not in the squares and streets, but on the battlefield in a full-scale war, it is absolutely obvious how unfair and unnatural Ukraine's alienation from Europe was. We will not leave a single percent of that alienation. I urge you to do everything in your power so that our community of nations - nations of values - will never again be divided or weakened! All of you see what endangers us. All of us! All who cannot imagine their life without freedom. All of you can see Ukraine’s significant contribution to the protection of our community. Everyone sees how important it is that we really united in defense after February 24. So, due to this, you also see that Ukraine should become a full member of the European Union and NATO. And I urge you to support our applications for membership in the EU and the Alliance! Ukrainians do not just believe - Ukrainians are sure that we can defend ourselves in this war and return the borders of a united Europe to the entire length of our eastern and southern borders. Ukrainians do not just believe - Ukrainians know that the strength of our democracy will be a guarantee that no tyranny to the east of us will be able to threaten Europe. But in order to realize all these years, to realize all this, we have to use all the strength of our community, all the potential of our cooperation in order to  gradually stop this terrorist Russian war and restore peace. That is why I proposed the Ukrainian Peace Formula. All points of our Peace Formula are beyond doubt. Every nation in our community is interested in ensuring that no dangerous incidents occur at nuclear facilities. We all want Russian terrorists to no longer be able to take people's lives. Each of our states needs guaranteed protection against any Russian missiles and any sabotage against infrastructure facilities. We are all interested in the stability of energy, food and other markets. We all strive for international law to retain its force and actually work. Each of us considers it fair that those guilty of war crimes, deportations and any manifestations of genocidal policy should be brought to justice. We all wish there would be no burnt cities and ruins instead of a normal life anywhere in Europe. All this is ensured by the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which, without being mistaken, can be called both the European peace formula and the world peace formula, as it is built on respect and protection of universal human values, on international law. From nuclear safety to the restoration of our territorial integrity, from the Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine to countering ecocide - everything is envisaged in our Formula. Dear friends! I suggest that you and your countries choose the point of the peace formula in which you can show your leadership. Joint action is what constitutes true peacemaking. And while we concentrate our forces to implement this Formula, we must maintain one hundred percent principled position in countering Russian aggression. Russia has bet on a genocidal policy, and that is why it is destroying our energy infrastructure. To \"kill\" electricity, water and heat supply in winter - and this is Russia's goal - is to put the lives of millions of people in direct danger. This is equivalent to the use of weapons of mass destruction - an absolute crime. Therefore, it will be right if you in your parliaments designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, as the parliaments of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and the Czech Republic have done. It will be right if your countries constantly strengthen sanctions against Russia, which has become the complete opposite of our community and the most anti-European power in the world. It is the constant strengthening of sanctions that will not allow the terrorist state to adapt and find new ways of ensuring its terror. A new, ninth sanctions package of the European Union is needed, new world sanctions against Russia for terror - immediately after limiting export prices for Russian energy resources. It will be right if we prevent Russia's key terrorist plan and provide Ukraine with full protection of the sky. When Russian missiles, Iranian drones, and any other instruments of terror fail to reach their intended targets, Russia will have to do what we need, namely, follow our Peace Formula. We can ensure this! But for this, Ukraine needs to be provided with a sufficient number and quality of air defense and missile defense systems. With a sufficient weight of defense and financial support. The terrorist state must see that it stands no chance. Since 2013 and until today, Ukrainians, with the support of our friends, have demonstrated that nothing is impossible for us when we are truly united and defend our unconditional values. So, let's maintain our unity! And let’s fight for freedom! I thank all of you for your support! Long live freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! First of all, it should be said that today is the professional holiday of our paratroopers - the Day of Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I'm in a relevant gift. The boys handed it over and asked to wear it. It’s my pleasure! In particular, this is the day of the 25th Sicheslav Separate Airborne Brigade, the 80th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, the 81st Separate Airmobile Brigade and the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, which distinguished themselves during the liberation of the Kharkiv region and our other lands. This is the day of the 46th Separate Airmobile Brigade, which took part in the liberation of Kherson and the occupied territories of the left bank of Ukraine. The day of the 79th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, which extremely bravely defends our state in the Luhansk region and the Donetsk region. This is the day of units of the 132nd Іeparate Reconnaissance Battalion, which took part in the liberation of the Zhytomyr region and Kyiv region together with other units of the Airborne Assault Troops. The day of the warriors of the 148th Separate Artillery Division who every day accurately \"subtract\" the enemy in the most threatening areas of the front. This is the day of the 71st Separate Hunting Brigade, which became part of the Airborne Assault Troops recently, but has already proven itself well. I thank you all, warriors! Thank you to all Ukrainian paratroopers! In the morning, in the White Hall of the Heroes of Ukraine in the Mariyinsky Palace, I had the honor of presenting awards on the occasion of the professional holiday to the best fighters. I handed over the Gold Star Orders to the relatives of our Heroes who gave their lives for Ukraine. Our Airborne Assault Troops, like all the Defense Forces of Ukraine, pay an extremely high price for our people to preserve their freedom. Thousands of Ukrainian men and women died fighting for our country. We should always remember them. We must always honor their courage and self-sacrifice. I spoke today about Ukraine's contribution to the protection of freedom and European values in an address to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. I called on the countries of the Alliance to take specific actions to implement the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which can reliably guarantee peace and justice for Ukraine and the entire Euro-Atlantic community. I also called on all parliaments of NATO member states to finally adopt a decision on designating Russia as a terrorist state. I believe that gradually we will reach this result - this is how Russia will be perceived in the world. Exactly what it has become. A terrorist state. And I thank all the members of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, who today adopted the relevant resolution to confirm this and our other positions. Today I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron about the implementation of several points of our Peace Formula at once. Namely, about radiation safety and the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as well as about the energy security of Ukraine and Europe. We are working to ensure the implementation of the IAEA order to stop any hostile activity against Ukrainian nuclear facilities. And for this, the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is extremely important. Russia must withdraw all its militants from there and stop shelling the station. I am grateful to Mr. President Macron for his willingness to support the protection of our energy facilities. We are also doing everything to make the conference on the reconstruction of Ukraine and the implementation of our Fast Recovery Plan, in which France is ready to show leadership, as effective as possible. Today, our energy workers had to apply not only stabilizing shutdowns, but also unscheduled ones. This is caused by a higher level of consumption than the country can provide at this time. Therefore, I would like to appeal to all representatives of regional authorities and local communities: please do not stop communicating about the rational consumption of electricity. Of course, energy workers, utility workers, rescuers and everyone involved are working at their maximum. But the systemic damage to our energy sphere by the attacks of Russian terrorists is so significant that all our people and businesses should be very frugal and spread consumption by hours of the day. As of this evening, the situation is particularly difficult in Kyiv and the region, as well as in the Vinnytsia, Sumy, Ternopil, Cherkasy, Odesa regions and some other cities and districts. Please try to limit your personal use of electricity in areas where there is the most difficulty on a daily basis, and especially during peak consumption hours. Of course, there should be a very frugal approach in public places as well. And one more thing. Today is the ninth anniversary of the beginning of Maidan - the Revolution of Dignity. Ninth... But the freedom and dignity of the Ukrainian people is more than a thousand years old. It is worth remembering this. There were many threats to the freedom of our people and the very existence of Ukrainians. But the people got through it. And now we have a historic opportunity to defend Ukrainian freedom once and for all. I believe that it will be so. I thank everyone who supports our country! Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Eternal glory and honor to all those who gave their lives for the freedom of our people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear friends! It is an honor for me to address the Congress of Mayors, which unites now and always many leaders of French society. I know that I will be heard by senators and deputies of the French parliament, government ministers, prefects, heads of cities and municipalities, the President of the French Republic. You represent millions of French citizens, and I want to explain today what is most important now for millions of Ukrainians. I will be as specific as possible. The Russian war hit the entire territory of Ukraine, but the occupiers temporarily managed to seize part of the territory of ten of our regions. What are the 10 regions of Ukraine? These are more than 11,000 settlements. Of these 11 thousand, just imagine, the total number of cities and villages of Ukraine that came under occupation is more than three thousand seven hundred. These are big cities and small towns. Both ancient powerful settlements and villages with only a few houses. It was a very different life. But now we see one thing in all these settlements - a complete lack of any opportunities to live normally and freely. We managed to liberate more than 1,800 settlements from the Russian occupation. And the consequences of the occupation are very similar everywhere. The Russian soldiers mined everything they managed to mine. The occupiers looted everything they managed to loot. In general, hundreds of thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged by shelling across Ukraine. Thousands of social objects. The occupiers leave behind a completely destroyed infrastructure... Imagine what it is like - people under the occupation have lived without communication, electricity, normal water supply for six months. I will give an example of one city - Kherson. This is a city in the south of Ukraine. Regional center, port. Kherson, like the entire region, has become a new home for many residents of Crimea who left the peninsula after its capture by Russia in 2014. The Russian army occupied Kherson in the spring of this year. On November 11, the liberation of the city began. What did we see in it? Of the three hundred thousand citizens who lived in Kherson before, about one hundred thousand remained in the city. They had nothing. There was no electricity or communication. There was no water. Only after our return did pharmacies start working in the city. We are resuming the work of the medical sphere, the provision of social services. The Russian military did not just rob people, taking away everything valuable... They broke or destroyed all equipment that could work to restore communication and supplies for people, for example, heat in the winter. They mined administrative buildings, and some of them simply have to be blown up, because it is impossible to demine them without risking the lives of sappers. Kherson has always been a peaceful and tranquil southern city. Now we will have to spend years to heal its wounds after the Russian occupation. And in general, there are still about two thousand towns and villages that we still have to liberate and restore. At least dozens of them were completely destroyed by the strikes of the Russian army - like Mariupol or Volnovakha. Dear friends! When Ukraine asks for help in this war, it is not just about the clash of states - it is not just about the fact that Russia has come to take our land and our resources, which it wants to appropriate. This is a clash of two opposite attitudes towards people and towards life. When Russia comes to a city, nothing is left of normal life there. Russia brings repression and abuse, takes not just property from people... There are thousands of examples, in particular, of how the Russian military simply destroyed residential buildings or cars on the roads. There are thousands of proofs that mining and destroying energy, medical, educational and other infrastructure in Ukraine is a deliberate Russian policy. They want Ukrainians to simply not be able to live on this land. When the Ukrainian flag returns to the liberated territory, we do everything so that normal life returns with it. The same life you are used to in your cities. That is why Ukraine is so grateful to everyone who supports us - our defense, finances, reconstruction.  It is literally a life saving aid. Now, on the eve of winter, we are facing one of the greatest threats since the beginning of all-out war. Russian missile terror destroyed almost half of our energy infrastructure. And we know that the Kremlin has set the task of continuing the attacks on energy facilities. To turn the cold of winter into a weapon of mass destruction. With this, Russia wants to do to the entire territory of Ukraine what it is doing to the occupied cities and villages. It wants to destroy life. Of course, we oppose that. Just yesterday, I spoke with President Emmanuel Macron about what we can do together to defend against these Russian tactics. We have clear agreements. In particular, about holding in early December a conference on the rapid reconstruction of Ukraine already now - in accordance with our Plan for the rapid recovery of Ukraine. And I invite all of you to join the Conference and related efforts. I invite you to also contact the Embassy of Ukraine in France to find out what other options of help exist. In order to get through this winter and not allow Russia to turn the cold into a tool of terror and subjugation, we need many things - from generators of various capacities to Starlinks. For us, this is not just a matter of equipment. For Ukraine, this is protection against terror. Just like help with demining or equipment for firefighters and rescuers, for our doctors, which is already provided at the level of French cities and municipalities, the provision of generators and specific communication systems is an absolutely clear protection of people. I urge you to be very specific as well! Specific in help. And to support the protection of our cities and communities against terror. Together we can definitely do it. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We have some much needed financial news today. First, there is another tranche of macro-financial aid from the European Union worth 2.5 billion euros. It is very important. We are also waiting for the approval of the macro-financial aid program for the next year in the amount of 18 billion euros. Second, the United States of America has announced that it will soon provide $4.5 billion in additional funding to directly support our budget. I am grateful to the partners for these important steps of solidarity. Due to such decisions of our friends, we maintain social stability and, despite all the Russian strikes, fulfill our social obligations. And these are obligations to millions of people. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, we have been making stable payments to pensioners - that's almost 11 million older Ukrainians. Indexation of pensions was carried out, as provided by law. 6 million citizens have some form of social support. This month alone, social payments totaled almost 14 billion hryvnias. This is assistance to those with many children, the poor, single mothers, and people with disabilities. Also more than 2 million internally displaced persons receive assistance from the state. Plus salaries for employees of the budget sector. We do everything to ensure payments for all our defenders. The financial frontline for Ukraine is now as important as the frontline on the battlefield. And I thank everyone who helps our state accumulate the necessary funds. Both to our friends in the world and to businesses that, despite everything, continue to work and pay taxes. As for the energy frontline. Energy and utility workers in many regions continue restoration of the network. We are also preparing responses to possible new terrorist attacks against our energy system. As of this evening, only stabilizing shutdown schedules are used in 16 regions and in Kyiv. But we must understand that in case of consumption spikes, emergency shutdowns are also possible. We are also rolling out our new \"Points of Invincibility\" project to support people across the country. As of this day, more than 4,000 such points have already been prepared. More are planned. If massive Russian strikes take place again and if there is an understanding that the electricity supply cannot be restored within hours, the work of \"Points of Invincibility\" will be activated - all basic services will be there, including electricity, mobile communications and the Internet, heat, water, and a first-aid kit. Absolutely free and 24\/7. Points will necessarily work at all regional and district administrations, as well as at schools, buildings of the State Emergency Service, etc. A special website, nezlamnist.gov.ua, with a map of such points throughout the country is already available. It is constantly updated. It's important to see now where these points are in your city, in your community, and keep an eye on the map for updates in the coming weeks as new points are added. On the website and in all \"Points of Invincibility\" you will be able to find out where the nearest gas station, bank, pharmacy and grocery store are operating. All of us must be prepared for any scenario, considering what terrorists are fighting against our people and what they are trying to do. Local authorities are tasked with informing people about the existence of \"Points of Invincibility\". It should be very simple: in government buildings, in pharmacies, grocery stores, in post offices, there should be information about where a person can find support in the event of a long-term power outage. And it is very important that conscientious business is already joining this initiative of ours. Thanks to all the entrepreneurs who decided to support society now and make their business facilities also \"Points of Invincibility\" - with generators, Starlinks, water and other stuff. And please note that on our website nezlamnist.gov.ua there is a special form for business representatives who want to join and become a \"Point of Invincibility\" for Ukrainians. I am sure: by helping each other, we will all be able to get through this winter together. The situation on the frontline has not changed over the past day. In all areas of the front, the same dynamics as in the previous days is maintained. Donetsk region - fierce attacks, constant shelling. I thank all our heroes, who courageously hold out despite everything! Luhansk region - with battles yet little by little we are strengthening our position and moving forward little by little. Kherson region and other territories of the south - we are doing everything to reduce the combat potential of the occupiers and eliminate their ability to carry out shelling of our cities. Step by step, we will bring the Russian army to new defeats, and no shelling of Kherson or any of our cities will help the occupiers. The sea... On our United24 fundraising platform, we are actively raising funds for naval drones. Unity, as always, gives a great result. Ordinary people. More than 50 Ukrainian companies. International businesses. Plus our Lithuanian friends. Plus the IT community. In total, people from 93 countries joined this initiative of ours! We are gradually building the Ukrainian fleet of naval drones! I thank everyone who supports us! Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps loved ones get through this difficult time! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen! We expect a strong reaction from the world to today's Russian terror. We expect the reaction of partners. We expect the reaction of friends - not just observers. We expect the reaction of all those who really recognize the UN Charter. We are doing everything possible. Ukraine presented the Peace Formula. The world heard it. 10 points - how to restore the full power of the UN Charter violated by Russia, and guarantee the safety of Ukraine, the safety of Europe and all the peoples of the planet who suffer from the consequences of Russian aggression. In response to our Peace Formula, Russia is following the steps of its formula of terror. The very next day after I proposed the Ukrainian Peace Formula at the G19 summit in Indonesia, we received ten Russian missiles per each point of the Peace Formula. The strikes continued. We liberated Kherson - and as soon as the Russian army fled from there, it began to methodically destroy this city. Strikes every day. This night – another missile attack on the Zaporizhzhia region, on the hospital – on the buildings where the maternity ward was located. Russian terrorists took the life of a baby - the child was 2 days old when it was killed by a Russian missile! And then again - dead, dead, dozens of wounded. In the city of Vyshhorod this afternoon, a residential building was hit, 35 people were injured, 4 were killed. This is one of the main points of the Russian formula of terror - missiles. Only today - almost 70 missiles. Against our energy infrastructure. Unfortunately, a residential building was also hit. Hospitals, schools, transport, residential areas - everything was affected. Russian terror led to a blackout – and not only in Ukraine. The light also went out in neighboring Moldova. But the understanding of what Russia wants to achieve with such strikes should not disappear anywhere in the world. Energy terror is an analogue of the use of weapons of mass destruction. When the temperature is below zero outside, and tens of millions of people are left without electricity, heat and water as a result of Russian missiles hitting energy facilities, this is an obvious crime against humanity. Ladies and Gentlemen! Among you are representatives of a state that offers nothing to the world except terror, destabilization and disinformation. Any Russian formulas do not provide for anything else. And that's why I emphasize once again - it's time to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula! There must be no opportunity left for terror in the world! That is why we are turning to our partners for support to protect our skies. We need modern and effective air defense and missile defense systems, and I thank everyone who is already helping. What can a representative of a terrorist state tell you now? That civilians do not suffer from their missiles? Everything is obvious. It's all too obvious. And I urge you to take concrete steps to protect humanity and life! Russia has long been trying to turn the UN Security Council into a platform for rhetoric. But the Security Council was created as the world's most powerful platform for decisions and actions. This is what we can demonstrate. The Security Council should provide a clear assessment of the actions of the terrorist state in accordance with Chapter Seven of the UN Charter. Ukraine proposes that the Security Council adopt such a resolution condemning any forms of energy terror. Let's see if anyone in the world will be able to say, along with Russia, that terror against civilians is supposedly a good thing. I confirm the invitation from Ukraine regarding the mission of UN experts to critical infrastructure facilities of our country that have been or may be hit by Russian missiles. It is necessary to give a proper assessment of damage and destruction. It should be stated that these are strikes against the very infrastructure that ensures the lives of tens of millions of people. And finally, justice must be restored within the UN structures themselves. The terrorist state should not participate in any voting on the issues of its aggression, its terror. It is a stalemate when the one who caused the war, the one responsible for the terror, blocks any attempt by the UN Security Council to fulfill its mandate. This is nonsense that the veto right is reserved for the one who is waging a criminal war. It is necessary to lead the world out of this impasse. It is absolutely possible. The world should not be held hostage by one international terrorist. Russia is doing everything to make the electric generator a more powerful and necessary tool than the UN Charter. We must and can return real meaning to all things - and above all to the UN Charter. Your decisions are needed! Thank you for the opportunity! Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Indomitable people of an indomitable country! I’ve just addressed the UN Security Council and called for a reaction. Reaction to Russian terror. One seat in the Security Council is still occupied, and they tried to say something from there. I am sure that no one in the world wants to hear Russian lies anymore. In reality, this chair is empty. Today, the European Parliament recognized Russia as a terrorist state and called on the EU and member states to create a legal framework so that such a recognition works at the national level throughout Europe and has consequences – precisely legal consequences, not just political ones. And Russia - as if the whole world does not matter - continued its missile attacks today. The United States of America has announced another package of support in the amount of 400 million dollars. Everything necessary so that we can protect the life and freedom of our people. And Russia used missiles for another attack on another hospital and killed... a baby. Life that lasted only two days was cut short. Today, we are deploying Points of Invincibility across the country to support our people. To provide heat, electricity and communication. And Russia spends 67 missiles to hit the very basis of life of any people anywhere in Ukraine and provokes a blackout in Ukraine. When I received reports in the evening on the progress of power restoration, 11 regions were marked \"the entire region is without electricity\". As of the beginning of the night, we are gradually connecting new and new districts. Energy workers, utility workers, and State Emergency Service will work round the clock. The Kyiv region - the connection of household consumers has begun, 20% are already connected. The Chernihiv region is in a difficult situation, but we are looking for opportunities to provide electricity to people. The Cherkasy region - all critical infrastructure is working, we are doing everything to return energy to household consumers. The Odesa region - water supply is 100% connected, heat - 100%, household electricity consumers - still few, only 10%. But there should be more by morning. Volyn - tens of thousands of consumers are connected, we are working on all others. The Ternopil region - we are connecting district by district. The Lviv region was completely turned off. As of now, 90% are connected. Kyiv is in a very difficult situation. Work will continue throughout the night. We expect the result by tomorrow, in the first half of the day. It is the same in all other cities and communities that were affected or were left without energy. We are doing everything for the people. And the occupiers are doing everything to make people suffer, so that we can't even hear and see each other. Today, our team managed to bring home another 36 Ukrainians. 35 servicemen, one civilian. Two officers, 33 privates and sergeants. In spite of everything, we are saving our people and we will certainly return all the prisoners and deportees. This shows everything very clearly - about us and about them. It shows everything very accurately. The Russian occupiers still haven’t understood that they have only today. And we definitely have tomorrow. And I thank everyone who ensures that with their courage and their effectiveness! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Madam President, Dear Speakers of the Sejm and Senate of Poland, Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the opportunity to address you. Today is exactly 9 months from the day when Russia started a criminal and unprovoked full-scale war against Ukraine. Our country is showing unprecedented bravery by destroying the army of the occupier, who was bragging that he was allegedly the second most powerful in the world. Most of the countries of the world are showing strong solidarity, helping us free our land from occupation and protecting our people from Russia's genocidal policy. We see various international platforms finding the necessary solutions to help stop Russian terror, isolate the terrorist state as much as possible, and find a way out of the brutal global crises created by Russia. But why is there still no OSCE among these platforms? Why, in particular, is a terrorist state even after 9 months of its continuous crimes still a member of your Parliamentary Assembly? If it was not for the Polish decision regarding visas for the Russian delegation, for which I am grateful to Poland, grateful to the representatives of the Polish Sejm, the government, and also the President, so if it was not for this, the representatives of the terrorist state could be among you today. This fact is an open mockery of all the principles on the basis of which the OSCE was created. Russia uses massive missile strikes against peaceful cities. It is trying to leave millions of people without electricity, communication, heat and water. It is trying to turn millions of Ukrainians into refugees who would seek refuge in other countries - in your countries. Every day and every night for nine months, Russia has been shelling the cities it can reach with artillery and MLRS... And you all know very well that the current owners of Russia would like to do the same thing they are doing with Ukraine with other neighboring countries, too. They would love to if they could. If Ukraine had not stopped their aggressive ambitions. If the world had not shown solidarity. But the world was not looking for a meaningless compromise - all minus one - to fight Russian terror. So why should you be looking for that kind of compromise here? If obsolete regulations are designed to protect only false ideas about security and cooperation in Europe and do not really protect life and people, one cannot remain hostage to such procedures and regulations. Determination is required to change them. I urge you not to wait for winter, spring or summer to finally remove even the hypothetical possibility for supporters of terror to participate in any activity of your parliamentary assembly. I urge you to do everything you can to ensure that the OSCE is among those who are truly able to stop terror and help bring Russian murderers and torturers to justice. If you can act effectively at the level of your national parliaments, then the parliamentary assemblies must be able to act too - and not only at the level of verbal condemnations. Russia's war against Ukraine is a test for any international organization. Is it relevant or not? Is it capable of anything other than texts about what is happening, or not? Is it present among those who bring peace, or does it only care about how to preserve itself in its offices and halls? Russia does not read letters about peace and does not listen to statements about the Helsinki principles. Russia does not consider the presence of any Council in Europe as a value. Russia does not respect the Red Cross and will not obey just because some organization has been working for over a hundred years. You have to be where the greatest danger is, if your calling is to take care of safety. It is necessary to make effective decisions that have legal consequences for the enemies of a united Europe, if your task is to protect Europe. You have to fight for every person where a person is in the worst danger, you have to fight for access to such people, to really save them, if your task is to protect people. We see in Ukraine who really helps, and who perceives Russian terror as part of the television picture. We see who is trying for the sake of peace to break everything that stands in the way, and who is pretending that this is some kind of online genocide - watching and waiting for Russia to stop on its own at some point or for someone to somehow press the \"pause\" button. We see who shows humanity saving people, and who quietly thinks that Ukrainians can simply be sacrificed. We see it all. The world sees it. And there will definitely be conclusions. Conclusions about specific leaders who were afraid of true leadership. Conclusions regarding specific international organizations that opposed themselves to the movement of history. Conclusions about specific countries, which, unfortunately, were shackled by fear. Right now, and precisely on the basis of actions or lack of actions during the Russian terrorist war, the fate of many in the world is being determined. And I urge you to do everything possible so that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe becomes a co-creator of the victory over Russian terror, and therefore a co-creator of peace on our continent. I am grateful for the principled Presidency of the Assembly and for the conscientious work in the committees and at the level of national delegations - for all that serves to protect our values and helps isolate Russia for terror. And I urge to extend this principledness and conscientiousness to the procedural architecture of the Assembly and to the OSCE in general. The time has come for this reform! And, of course, in order to finally stop counting months of war and start counting the years of peace, it is necessary to use all national and international opportunities to put pressure on the terrorist state. Be leaders in this - and you will be leaders of the movement towards peace. Thank you for your attention! Thank you to everyone for supporting Ukraine! I believe that we will restore peace! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Restoration continues all day today - we are gradually restoring electricity, heat, water supply and communication. As of this evening, there are still problems with water in 15 regions. The most difficult situation is in the Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, Lviv, Poltava and Kharkiv regions. But together with the supply of electricity to critical infrastructure, we also provide water and heat supply. The situation with electricity remains difficult in almost all regions. But still, we are moving away from the blackout little by little - every hour we restore power to new and new consumers. It is still the most difficult in the capital and 15 regions: Vinnytsia, Dnipropetrovsk, Zhytomyr, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Lviv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Ternopil, Kharkiv, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi. There are also problems in other regions. Energy workers, utility workers, business - everyone is doing their part to give light again. This is truly a nationwide task - Ukraine is working as unitedly as possible in this. Thanks to the State Emergency Service and our entire system of regional administrations for the rapid deployment of the network of Points of Invincibility. In total, as of now, 4,362 points have been launched in most regions. And this is not yet the final figure - the network will grow according to how the points will be provided with generators and communication. Please, if your city has been without electricity or heat for more than 12 hours, use our Points of Invincibility. Assistance will also be provided at all police stations, at the facilities of the State Emergency Service. Please, if you know single or elderly people who need help, be sure to help them in these circumstances. A very important initiative was launched by our partners in the European Union. The European Parliament together with a network of European cities launched the \"Generators of Hope\" program. This will allow us to use the opportunities of horizontal cooperation in Europe - with cities, with businesses - and provide Ukraine with the energy equipment it needs now. I thank Mrs. Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament, and all our friends in the European Union who have already joined and are still joining. I held another meeting of the Staff today. Energy and communication issues were analyzed in great detail: the protection of the energy system from new Russian strikes, restoration work and the supply of equipment and the involvement of specialists. Special attention is paid to the communication system. No matter what the terrorists are planning, we have to preserve communication. Russia wants Ukrainians to not just find themselves without light and heat... Terrorists want to isolate us from each other so that we do not feel each other. Therefore, this is a fundamental question. And there will be additional decisions regarding this issue. We are preparing them. Of course, the situation on the frontline was examined very carefully and in detail at the meeting of the Staff. No matter how difficult it may be, we are holding the key frontiers in all directions. Our guys defend bravely. And there are directions where we are preparing to advance. We observe how the occupiers are trying to redeploy additional forces. We do everything to \"subtract\" these forces of theirs. Almost every hour, I receive reports of strikes by the occupiers at Kherson and other communities of the region. Such terror began immediately after the Russian army was forced to flee from the Kherson region. This is the revenge of those who lost. They do not know how to fight. The only thing they can still do is terrorize. Either energy terror, or artillery terror, or missile terror - that's all that Russia has degraded to under its current leaders. It is only the liberation of our land and reliable security guarantees for Ukraine that can protect our people from any Russian escalations. We work with partners every day for this. There will be important news soon. I addressed the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly today - the assembly is currently working in Poland. I called for the reform of this Organization so that it could finally help restore security in Europe. The principle of decision-making in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly is that it is necessary to agree on decisions for many months and to convince absolutely everyone, even to deprive the delegation of a terrorist state of its rights. It definitely shouldn't be so. During such a war, during such terror, decisions against the guilty state must be made instantly. I hope that the OSCE members will listen to the Ukrainian appeal. I had a call with the President of Israel. I informed him about the consequences of the Russian energy terror, about the needs of our state in view of this. Ukrainian initiatives to overcome the food crisis created by Russia were also discussed. I invited Israel to join our “Grain from Ukraine” humanitarian project. And, by the way, we already have specific agreements with different countries, different leaders, how to make this initiative of ours to supply food to the poorest countries truly global. Soon we will present all the details. And one more thing. Today, another 50 Ukrainian warriors were freed from Russian captivity. Two officers, 48 privates and sergeants. 15 of them were captured in the Kyiv region, on the territory of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. Seven were captured on Zmiinyi Island. Finally they will all be home. I am grateful to Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Malyuk, Lubinets and everyone who helps. And we will do absolutely everything possible and impossible to return every Ukrainian man and woman who are still being held by the occupiers. I thank everyone who supports Ukraine in this extremely difficult time! Thank you to everyone who fights and works for our country! We endured nine months of the full-scale war and Russia hasn’t found a way to break us. And it will not find it. We must continue to hold on like this in the future! In unity and helping each other. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear friends! Dear colleagues! Dear Gitanas, thank you for the invitation to take part in this discussion in Kaunas. This year we all saw a very important thing. It's like any athlete that can become champion only when participating in the competition. Like any judge that can convince everyone of his unbiased work and wisdom when the case hearing has started. Any teacher sees for himself what he is worth when students return to him years after and it is clearly seen in their eyes and life circumstances whether they have perceived what they have been taught. This year we saw Europe we've all been striving for. Europe we've been building for decades and dreaming of for much longer. We saw Europe in action. We saw Europe not only in its striving for justice, but also in the protection of justice. We saw Europe not only manifesting certain values, but also capable of winning on the basis of its values. We saw a united Europe not only as a goal or a set of agreements at the political level, but also as the results being achieved here and now. Europe has made conclusions from its historical mistakes made by previous generations. European nations no longer leave each other alone when tyranny starts an offensive. European leaders defend what unites all of us much more fiercely than what coincides with certain personal ideological views. European states achieve things that seemed fantasies ten years ago. This year the frontline in Ukraine has become the line of struggle of Europe for itself. 274 days have passed and it is obvious that the anti-European aggression of Russia will fail, and European freedom will be guaranteed. Russia still resorts to various forms of terror so far. Russia still has enough missiles and artillery to kill people everyday and provoke new difficulties for Ukraine and the whole of Europe. But what Russian imperialism has always bet on and what has ultimately caused Europe's defeat isn't and won't be the case. There is no split between Europeans. And maintaining such reality in Europe is our common task #1. This year Europe finally carries out energy disarmament of Russia. The continent's dependence on Russian energy resources has started to reduce. And it must vanish completely. And one of the key instruments for that is to limit Russian profit from exports of its resources. The introduction of price caps, i.e. forcible price restriction for Russian oil, has already become the topic of discussion in Europe and the world. And there are allegedly discussions about the level of 60 or 70 U.S. dollars. No doubt, such words are just sandbagging. They're rather an attempt to imitate something than to do something. And I am grateful to our Polish and Baltic colleagues for their quite relevant proposals. Limiting the price at the level of up to 30 U.S. dollars per barrel seems a more feasible proposal. And I am grateful that such a proposal has been put forward and is being advocated. Now is the time to ensure this achievement of Europe as well. And on the basis of this and other similar achievements, none of the potential enemies of Europe will ever be able to blackmail our continent with energy weapons. The energy security of Europe, and therefore the price security, will now be based first of all on cooperation and solidarity between Europeans, and on European energy rules. We also have one more result, which is definitely important. Dear friends! This year we have eliminated the gray zone on the EU borders, which Ukraine has been staying in for decades. Our state has become a candidate for EU membership and implements this perspective. Hence, we are finally eliminating the strategic uncertainty, which has been the source of instability for the whole continent and instigated Russia's revanchism. And we must begin our accession negotiations just as quickly as we've gained the candidate status. When Ukraine's fate is determined, the fate of the whole center and east of Europe is determined. Ukraine is and will be free, Ukraine is and will be democratic, Ukraine is and will be strong. Ukraine exists and will exist. Hence, Europe exists and will exist. So when we guarantee a long-standing security for Ukraine, we guarantee the same security for the whole continent. That is why, on the basis of what we have already managed to achieve, we must do one more thing. A very practical one. I have no doubt that eventually we will implement the Ukraine Peace Formula, stop the Russian aggression, and dismantle the threats it has brought to Ukraine, Europe and the world. But we must already show our vitality, the energetic nature of Europe. Just as the front line in Ukraine became the line of Europe's struggle for itself, the reconstruction of Ukraine must become for Europe a reconstruction of itself. This is the largest economic and humanitarian project of our generations. The greatest opportunities for the economic development of European countries. The biggest opportunities for European companies and the biggest boost for European production. Hence, this is the biggest potential for our social development. The implementation of this project has already begun. When we rebuild energy sphere to withstand Russian terror, it is rebuilding Europe. When we rebuild our infrastructure, social facilities, and housing to provide for Ukrainians, we give the whole of Europe an incentive to work for itself together with us. When we look for and find new logistics, production and trade opportunities for Ukraine, we look for and find them for everyone who cooperates with us. We do it as equals. We do this for our common interests. And that's how we must overcome the key challenge facing us now in order to strengthen us all. We must endure this winter - winter everyone will remember. We must do everything to remember not what it has threatened us with, but what we've managed to do to protect ourselves from this threat. And that is why we need to clearly understand the idea of Europe. A united Europe - it is very important. I often hear the same question - how Europe can help Ukraine . Of course, we are grateful for that, but is the question formed correctly? Europe can help itself. It's not about helping Ukraine stand up to Russia, it's about Europe being able to help itself stand up to Russia. It is not only in Ukraine that millions of people are without light and heat because of Russian terror. It is on the eastern flank of Europe that millions of Europeans are without light and heat due to Russian terror. It is not only Ukraine that Russia wants to break, it is Europe that Russia wants to break. We are all parts of one whole. What was a dream. What started with politics. What has become our life - a united Europe. This is the key idea. There is no Ukraine separate from Europe, just as there is no Poland or Lithuania or Romania or Latvia or Germany or France separate from Europe. This is our continent. This is our life. And this is our path that we can endure. Just as this winter and this war. All Europeans together. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your continued support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! The key task of today, as well as of other days this week, is energy. From Wednesday to today, it was possible to halve the number of people for whom electricity is cut off to stabilize the system. As of this evening, blackouts continue in most regions and in Kyiv. In total, more than six million subscribers. Almost 12 million subscribers were disconnected from the grid on Wednesday evening. Most of the problems are currently in the capital of Ukraine, as well as in Kyiv region, Odesa region, Lviv region, Vinnytsia region and Dnipropetrovsk region. Please, it is necessary to consume electricity sparingly in all regions, as before. If you don't have a power outage, it doesn't mean the problem is over. Please, if you have electricity, this does not mean that you can turn on several powerful electrical appliances at once. Spiked power draws are recorded every evening, which cause an increase in emergency blackouts. Now, as before, it is necessary to save energy. Points of Invincibility are deployed throughout the country. But I know that, unfortunately, not in all cities the local government has done a good job. In particular, there are many complaints in Kyiv. In fact, only the Points that are deployed at the base of the State Emergency Service and at the railway station of the capital are normally provided, and other Points still need to be improved, to put it mildly. Please pay attention. Kyiv residents need more protection. As of this evening, 600,000 subscribers have been disconnected from the grid in the city. Many Kyiv residents were without electricity for more than 20 or even 30 hours. I expect quality work from the mayor's office. No one will forgive anyone for desecrating the Kyiv Points of Invincibility. Please be more serious. As well as lies in reports of various levels. I was in Vyshgorod, Kyiv region today, where a Russian missile destroyed an apartment building and damaged the houses of an entire residential neighborhood. Six people have been killed then, dozens have been injured. My condolences to the families of the victims. We do everything to help and we help. I visited two Points of Invincibility in Vyshgorod: at the base of the State Emergency Service and at a local school. They are arranged exactly as it should be. In total, there are now more than 4,000 Points in the country, and it is the responsibility of each local leader to ensure that everything that should be there for people really works. I spoke today with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. I thanked her for the decision to provide a EUR 2.5 billion macro-financial assistance. They approved another EUR 0.5 billion by the end of the year and discussed the preparation of the support package for the next year. They also agreed on new steps in energy support for Ukraine. Today, I took part in the international symposium \"The idea of Europe\" in Lithuania. I called on the partners to take new steps for the sake of our joint victory and thanked Poland and the Baltic States for their principled stance to cap the price of exported Russian energy. I believe that the partners' proposals to introduce a more significant price restriction for Russian oil than was sounded this week are quite valid. In the evening, I signed another decree awarding our soldiers. Some 216 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were given state awards. I would especially like to mention the fighters of the 71st separate hunting brigade and the 24th Aidar assault battalion for their bravery and effectiveness in destroying the enemy and conducting counter-offensive actions. As well as the border guards of the Lviv and Mohyliv-Podilsky detachments, who are ferocious in defense of the Bakhmut and Avdiyivka directions. Thank you, warriors! Thank you to everyone who fights for our country! Who is doing everything to suppress the occupiers that are shelling, unfortunately, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and our other cities. Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine and Ukrainians! To everyone who brings heat, water, electricity and communication back to people. Glory to our indestructible people! Glory to all of you – well done! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear attendees! It is a great honor to have you here with us today Ladies and Gentlemen! I welcome you to our capital, the city of Kyiv, to this special event for us, which is dedicated to a special initiative and takes place on such a special day for our state, for Ukraine. Every year, on the last Saturday in November, we honor the memory of millions of people. Millions of tortured and murdered Ukrainians. Women, men, elderly people. Millions of children. Millions of victims of famine. In 1921, 1922, 1923, 1946, 1947, and the darkest years – 1932-1933. Today is the 90th anniversary of the genocide committed against us by the totalitarian Stalinist regime. Different historians call different numbers of victims, but either way, all of them are shocking. From four to eight million perished Ukrainians. We remember how it is when they want to destroy your people. Almost every family has been affected in one way or another. Almost everyone among us has someone in the National Memory Book of victims. We remember the stories of those who managed to survive these horrors, truly vivid memories. How they take away everything. How you can be shot for a hidden bowl of grain or flour. How a large family shares a loaf of bread for a week. How it is a soup from two rotten potatoes to eat the whole day. How in the morning there is no strength to even live and open your eyes. How it is hard to fall asleep at night because you just want to eat. How exhausted people fall dead on the road. And others are too exhausted to take and bury their bodies. How whole families die, how streets wound up dead, how villages perish. How in already independent Ukraine, even in the new millennium, our grandparents, who survived the Holodomor, treated food with respect. How carefully they gathered the crumbs that remained on the table after dinner into a handful. How they said: there were times in childhood when we dreamed of a piece of bread or a plate of borscht. Such terrible memories. We know about it. We remember that. We have to! And we see what is happening today in the world, what is happening in Ukraine. They want to destroy us again with bombs, bullets, cold, and again with hunger. On February 24, Russia started a full-scale war against our society, the people of Ukraine, against our state. The occupation and the blockade left thousands of people without food and water from the very beginning. We will not allow millions of people in the world to be left without food and water. We remember how it used to be. Unfortunately, we know how it happens today. We won't make it happen tomorrow. Neither here, nor in any country of the world on the entire planet. Our flag is a blue sky and a golden wheat field. Our land has always given generous fruits. Our country has always shared these fruits with the whole world. Ukraine is traditionally one of the largest exporters of food to different countries of the world on different continents. Our wheat was highly valued in Africa and the Middle East. Dairy products, vegetables, fruits, corn – in Europe. Sunflower oil was on shelves all over the world. This year, unfortunately, is different. Russian troops surrounded Ukrainian ports. They blocked the export of our food. They put the world on the brink of starvation. They provoked a food crisis. The rapid increase in the price of products undermines the economic security of ordinary people, the well-being of millions of families, domestic stability and regional security. Mass protests due to rising food, fertilizer, and fuel prices threaten many countries and societies. We must prevent the further spread of this crisis and this global challenge. Ukraine, as one of the guarantors of global food security, will continue making its key contribution. Despite the war. Despite any challenges. Despite the obstacles. Despite the attempt to destroy us. Ukraine will fulfill its export obligations regarding the supply of grain and other foodstuffs to the global market. Ukraine is a fighter for life, its own and that of other peoples. Life without slavery and hunger. The first practical proof of this was the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The export of Ukrainian food was unblocked. To date, almost 500 vessels have left our ports. This is 12 million tonnes of foodstuffs for 40 countries of the world. And for all societies, because when we talk about continents and states, first of all, we are talking about people. In particular, those suffering from the food crisis, who found themselves on the brink of this challenge – on the brink of starvation. However, the Grain Initiative, unfortunately, still operates not at its full capacity. Russia is trying to delay the movement of vessels. There are more than 80 ships in line in the Bosphorus. We advocate an increase in the number of ports and the indefinite continuation of this important initiative. So that Russia does not block it again. Again and again. At the same time, it is obvious that today even the full functioning of the grain corridor is insufficient to meet food needs. Especially of those countries that are in acute danger of hunger. To overcome this and food threats in general, Ukraine has organized this event. This is the first such event – the International Summit on Food Security. Here I want to announce and tell you about our new international initiative, supported by you, colleagues, and we are very grateful to you – Grain from Ukraine. Within its framework, Ukrainian food will be sent to countries in Africa and Asia. Our goal is ambitious and specific – to save at least 5 million people from hunger. On this path, Ukraine has already taken the first steps – sent the first ships. In the middle of November – 27,000 tonnes of wheat for Ethiopia. Another vessel is being loaded today. And this is another 30,000 tonnes of wheat for people in Ethiopia. Three more vessels are currently going to the ports of Ukraine for loading. They will deliver more than 80,000 tonnes of food wheat to the countries that need it the most. In general, under the Grain From Ukraine program, by the end of next spring, we plan to send at least 60 vessels from our ports – at least ten per month – to countries at risk of famine and drought. This is Ethiopia, these are Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Congo, Kenya, Nigeria. All of them are in dire need of help. Imagine – just one ship with grain provides food for 90,000 people. Sixty such ships will be able to prevent the starvation of at least 5 million inhabitants of the world. We invite other states and socially responsible businesses to this humanitarian initiative, humanitarian program. And I am happy to announce today that on the day of its launch, 20 countries joined Grain From Ukraine and there will be more. And I am glad that today we all gathered together in Kyiv. Some are offline, some are online. But in this format, today the participants of the International Summit on Food Security are President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, President of France Emmanuel Macron, and Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz. Prime Ministers of Poland, Lithuania, Romania, and Belgium: Mateusz Morawiecki, Ingrida Šimonytė, Nicolae Ciucă, Alexander De Croo. President of Hungary Katalin Novák. UN Secretary General Mr. Guterres. Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. Prime Minister of Sweden Ulf Kristersson and Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenković. Presidents of Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Slovenia, Bulgaria. Secretary General of NATO. High-ranking officials of the UK, the Czech Republic, Italy, Austria, Spain, Qatar, and Canada. The United States Agency for International Development, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the World Food Programme in Ukraine, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. I believe that the mix is strong enough for the first such initiative. I want to thank you all. Based on the results of the summit, we will issue a Joint Statement. It will remain open for accession by interested parties. However, we welcome not only joining it but also any other format of participation in this program. Because its goal is our common goal – to prevent hunger in the world. The future of humanity depends on the readiness to respond effectively to the challenges of today. And one of the most important tasks is to have effective mechanisms – and this is one such mechanism, which is effective and functional – to guarantee food security. Today, I want to suggest that a new international institution has been created as a continuation of this initiative. An institution that will be a new, efficient and effective tool to prevent global threats and rapidly respond to them. All threats: food, humanitarian, security. With headquarters in Kyiv or Odesa, from where a ship will soon depart within the Grain From Ukraine program. Ladies and Gentlemen! Amid ongoing Russian aggression, it is no less important to recognize the Holodomor of 1932–1933 as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people. This has already been done by the United States, Canada, Australia, Poland – in total, by our friends from 17 countries. In 2022 it was Brazil and the Czech Republic. The day before, I called on the states and international organizations that have not yet done so to do this. On November 23, Romania approved the relevant decision. We are grateful. On November 24 it was Ireland. On November 25 – Moldova. I invite others to join this important historical truth. This will be a strong manifestation of solidarity with Ukraine in these extremely difficult times for us. In addition, there is something that can be done today. All of Ukraine will hold a national minute of silence today. We will light a memorial candle in our windows. We invite all other countries and nations to join us. At 16:00 Kyiv time. At 15:00 CET. When it will be 2:00 p.m. in London, it will be 9:00 a.m. in New York and Toronto, 7:30 p.m. in New Delhi, 10:00 p.m. in Beijing, 11:00 p.m. in Tokyo and Seoul, and 1:00 a.m. in Sydney. As proof that we all do not forget, we all remember the past and are ready to build a different, just future together. The human future, at any time of the day or night. Finally, I invite everyone to Ukraine in a year – for our next second summit – the International Summit on Food Security and our Grain From Ukraine initiative. To evaluate joint efforts. To outline further plans. I am sure, we will be able to achieve results and overcome all threats only united, only together. We can win only together. Ukraine and the civilized world without war, without terrorism, without hunger. Thank you very much! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Indestructible people of the indestructible country! Today, we held the first International Summit on Food Security. We held it in Kyiv – together with our partners. And precisely these days were chosen deliberately, when we commemorate the victims of the Holodomor of 1932-1933. Ukrainians went through genocide. And today we are doing everything possible and impossible to stop Russia's new genocidal policy. A new one – but similar to the one that killed millions of people in the 20th century. And we don't just fight off aggression. Step by step, we are creating a system that will stop aggression, dismantle its consequences, and guarantee long-term security – the security of Ukraine, all of Europe, and the world. Food security is one of the key elements of global stability. This is where Ukraine's leading role is most evident. Thanks to our export grain initiative from three Black Sea ports, we sent about 12 million tonnes of food to the world market. 40 countries of the world. Of this amount, more than two and a half million tonnes are for countries that are not just short of food, but in a severe crisis. As part of the UN Food Programme, we have helped countries where people are literally starving or on the verge of starvation. These include Ethiopia and Yemen. We also helped Somalia and Afghanistan. And this is just the beginning. Today, we officially announced the launch of our new humanitarian initiative. Grain From Ukraine. And we already have agreements with many partners on joint work within Grain from Ukraine. The European Union, the United States, France, the UK, Germany, Japan, Qatar, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Italy, Austria, Spain, Sweden, Slovenia, Switzerland and others. More than 20 countries supported our food security summit. The total amount that we have accumulated for Grain From Ukraine is already about $150 million. Work continues. We are preparing up to 60 ships. All of us together do not just send Ukrainian foodstuffs to those countries that suffer the most from the food crisis. We affirm that never again should hunger be used as a weapon. If it weren't for Ukrainian food, if it weren't for our joint leadership with our partners, social stability in such regions as North Africa or the Middle East would not have been maintained. This is exactly what Russia wanted. We must – and we can! – not allow this. Today, I met with the Prime Minister of Belgium. We discussed our joint actions – and not only for the sake of food security. We signed a declaration on Belgium's support for Ukraine's full membership in both the European Union and NATO – this is an important signal. We discussed further political and defense cooperation, sanctions against Russia, the possibility of Belgium helping us through this winter. Today, a meeting of the Lublin Triangle took place in Kyiv – at the level of prime ministers – Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. They signed a joint statement on further support for Ukraine and the international legal order. So, today is a very busy diplomatic day. A day that strengthened both Ukraine and our partners. Today, our power engineers continued restoring the system – and we now have more opportunities to generate and supply electricity. But, unfortunately, not enough to make the supply completely stable. As of this morning, half as many subscribers have been disconnected from the grid than last night. However, in 14 regions and in Kyiv, there are still restrictions for more than a hundred thousand subscribers in each of the regions. If consumption increases in the evening, the number of outages may increase. This once again shows how important it is now to save power and consume it rationally. This afternoon, the enemy launched a missile attack on Dnipropetrovsk region – on private houses, on ordinary houses. There are wounded. They shelled Donetsk region, the south, and other regions. Russia is turning this day – the day of remembrance – into a day of terror. The occupiers will definitely be responsible for all this. And we will drive them out of our land. And one more. Today, we managed to release 12 more Ukrainians from Russian captivity. Of them, three are civilians, two are officers, and seven are privates and sergeants. This week alone, we returned 98 of our people from captivity to Ukraine. We will return all the others. Thanks to everyone who helps us! Thank you to every leader who works with us for the sake of European and global security! Glory to our soldiers and our indestructible people! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine. And please, today honor the memory of Ukrainian men and women, children and adults, whose lives were taken by the Holodomor-genocide."

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Another week of full-scale war is coming to an end - a week in which we accomplished a lot. All together. Thanks to our unity. After the massive terrorist attack last Wednesday, we have been restoring electricity generation and supply day after day. As of today, in most regions of the country, only stabilization schedules of shutdowns are in effect. The situation is under control by the energy workers. And for that, I am thankful to the thousands of people who worked round the clock all over our state to restore light, water, heat and communication. I thank all the employees of energy companies, utility services, repair crews, regional authorities and leaders of local communities who helped. I would also like to thank the businesses that participated. Ukrainian unity again and again demonstrates its strength, demonstrates our effectiveness. I thank all Ukrainian entrepreneurs who are now making their offices, branches, cafes and other facilities new Points of Invincibility. Who do everything to help people. We understand that terrorists are preparing new strikes. We know that for sure. And as long as they have missiles, they won’t stop, unfortunately. But our ability to help each other and take care of the most vulnerable - the elderly, families with children, those who lost homes and relatives in the war - our mutual assistance is one of the elements of protection against terror and our strength. The upcoming week can be as hard as the one that passes. Our Defense Forces are preparing. The whole state is preparing. We work out all scenarios, including with our partners. And our unity must be ready. So please do not leave without help those whom you can help. And please pay attention to the air alerts during the week. Together and helping each other we will pass this challenge of war as well: this winter, this Russia's attempt to use the cold against people. The situation at the front remains very difficult. And most of all - in the Donetsk region, as in previous weeks. I want to thank all our warriors, all our heroes for their resilience today! To endure now and defend ourselves now is to endure and defend ourselves for generations to come for all Ukrainians throughout our beautiful land. We are doing and will do everything possible to strengthen our defense. We are doing and will do everything to hold Russia accountable for this war, for this terror. And in order to achieve these results, there will be new important steps in the upcoming week. I thank all our partners who help us! I am grateful to every leader who perceives the defense of Ukraine as the defense of freedom and security for his country as well! Together we will endure everything. I'm sure of that! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on today. The morning began with the Staff meeting. Frontline. Provision of the army. Energy sector. Communication. Points of Invincibility. Strengthening our air defense. Working with partners. The situation in the frontline areas and suppression of Russian firing positions. We keep all key issues in the focus of the Staff’s attention. That day, as every other day, the occupiers again shelled Kherson and the communities of the region. In just one week, the enemy fired 258 times on 30 settlements of our Kherson region. The Russian army also damaged the pumping station that supplied water to Mykolaiv. Well, what can be said about them? This is the real essence of those random \"comrades\" who took over Russia. After 20 years of rule, a large part of their own state is in such devastation, as if a war had taken place there. And this is not a war - it’s just because they have come. They are capable of nothing but devastation. This is all they leave behind. And what they are doing now against Ukraine is their attempt to take revenge. To take revenge for the fact that Ukrainians have repeatedly defended themselves from them. Ukraine will never be a place for devastation. Ukraine will never accept orders from these \"comrades\" from Moscow. We will do everything to restore every object, every house, every enterprise destroyed by the occupiers. Today I spoke about Ukraine's needs for protection and reconstruction with the foreign ministers of seven Northern European countries. Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Norway, Iceland. I thanked them for this joint visit to Ukraine - a gesture of support and solidarity that is very important right now. We have agreements on further cooperation in the defense and energy spheres, in the reconstruction projects of our state and in the sanctions sphere. The Ukrainian Peace Formula was discussed with each of the delegations, in great detail - the possible participation of each state in the implementation of the points of the Formula. We are actively working to create a Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. We are working at different levels. In particular, I discussed this today with the foreign ministers of the partner countries. Head of the Office Andriy Yermak took part in the conference held in France. Members of the working group on the issue of creating a Tribunal work there. Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin and the First Lady of Ukraine represented our country in Britain today - a conference on combating sexual violence in wartime was held there. Mr. Kostin is preparing to meet with the G7 ministers of justice in Berlin tomorrow. The main topic of all these events is Russia's responsibility for war and terror. There will be more news tomorrow. I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. By the way, the Netherlands provides substantial assistance to Ukraine in the preparation of the Tribunal for aggression and in establishing the truth about all Russian murderers and torturers. Ukraine is grateful for this. I heard a very important signal from Mr. Prime Minister Rutte - a signal about next year. Support for our state will only increase. I met with the ambassadors of our United24 fundraising platform. Andriy Shevchenko, Oleksandr Usyk, Scott Kelly - they were in Kyiv, and Elina Svitolina, Liev Schreiber and Timothy Snyder joined the meeting via video call. The main issue is getting through this winter, helping Ukraine with generators and other energy equipment. Detailed news will be tomorrow, but I will note: we will do everything so that Ukraine receives the maximum possible help from the world. And one more thing. The volume of accumulated funds for our Grain from Ukraine initiative is growing and already exceeds 180 million U.S. dollars. This is already one of the historically largest Ukrainian humanitarian initiatives. And it will be even bigger. Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Great Britain, Greece, Estonia, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Canada, Qatar, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, USA, Türkiye, Hungary, Finland, France, Croatia, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Sweden, European Union have already announced their financial, technical or logistical contribution to the Grain From Ukraine initiative - this is a significant participation. Plus the Republic of Korea. Japan - from the first days. And also NATO and, of course, the UN. I am thankful to everyone who participates! Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine implement our Peace Formula! I am sure that it can be fully implemented - all points just as the point on food security. Glory to each of our warriors! Glory to all who work for the victory of our state! And please pay attention to the air sirens, don't forget that. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Mr. President! Mr. Secretary General! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am honoured to present Ukraine’s candidate for hosting World’s Fair 2030. To present Odesa – and the entire Black Sea region. Why Odesa? Why Ukraine? Why the Black Sea? This year, Ukraine has become the world’s role model of bravery. Billions of people from every continent could see what Ukrainian invincibility means, why Russian terror will not achieve its goal. And they will see how Ukraine becomes a role model of reconstruction. Neither winter cold, nor darkness nor other manifestations of terror will help Russia conquer Ukrainians. The time of Ukrainian victory shall come. And then… The reconstruction of our country will become the most momentous economic, technological, and humanitarian project of our time. Even now, we engage dozens of our partner countries to rebuild Ukraine. The total volume of work amounts to over a trillion dollars. Even now, we create a special patronage system. The system will enable leading countries and companies to take patronage over the reconstruction of Ukrainian regions, cities, industries, and enterprises. Not just to recover them but to show that a free world and conscious countries are always more powerful than any tyranny and aggression. We can already see the interest in patronage from France and Great Britain, the Netherlands and Germany, Denmark and Finland, Italy and Türkiye, Poland and Portugal, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, Latvia and Estonia, Switzerland and Slovakia, Austria and Greece, Canada and the United States of America, Japan and Australia. And this is not a full list of the countries. In 2030, Ukrainian reconstruction will have already shown a significant part of the projected results, and Ukraine will be the country to demonstrate what humanity is capable of when all peoples cooperate for peace and security, for development, and a more comfortable future for all. And this is, by the way, a fundamental meaning behind the World’s Fairs. So, the reality of our country and the spirit of the World’s Fairs will ally. Specifically in Ukraine, specifically in 2030. Even now, we have already proved that the Black Sea region is one of the key guarantors of the world’s stability. Our Odesa is that big port that ensures the social well-being of dozens of countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe. This year, we have proved it with our Grain Export Initiative. We will solidify it with another international humanitarian project “Grain From Ukraine”. It will help recover food security in the poorest countries that are balancing at the edge of famine and destabilization – Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen, and others. These and many other countries will be widely aware of why Odesa and the Black Sea are so significant. We will save millions of people – Odesa will save millions of people thanks to the work of its ports. We are already integrating Ukraine into the European Union. We have already become a part of the EU Single Market. We will become a part of the EU institutions. We have already joined the EU Single Energy System. We will become those whose potential in “green” energy will replace dirty Russian fossil fuel for Europe. We have already helped Europe to overcome many internal controversies and actually unite – unite in its actions. Enhanced by Ukraine, Europe will become a truly independent and really solid global player. 2030 is the time when we will be able to celebrate it. To celebrate it together with all Europeans. Is it fair that the World’s Fairs have never been hosted in this part of Europe? Many world regions have already been represented. Europe had the honour to host the World’s Fairs in different years. But not the East of Europe. We should change it. And Odesa will be a perfect place to do it. The city that through the centuries has been tied economically and culturally with Türkiye and Romania, Georgia and Bulgaria, Moldova and other countries of our region as well as many world’s regions. The city that has always been multinational and multicultural – the city of diversity. The city that may host the World’s Fair for the first time but has been connected with the world for centuries. Ladies and Gentlemen! When you visit Ukraine and our Odesa in 2030, you will sense the power, freedom, and culture of not just one country and one city. You will experience the potential of the entire humanity. That is why it is 2030. That is why it is Odesa, Ukraine, and the Black Sea. That is why it is the World’s Fair. May the victory of freedom and our striving for peace become widely seen! Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, we took several new steps to restore justice to Ukraine, to bring to justice all those responsible for this criminal war. We are already cooperating with many countries and international organizations so that every Russian murderer receives the deserved punishment. We have already established cooperation with the International Criminal Court and will increase it. But, unfortunately, the available international legal instruments are not enough for justice. Even in the International Criminal Court, it is still impossible to bring the highest political and military leadership of Russia to justice for the crime of aggression against our state - for the primary crime. The crime that gave birth to all other crimes of this war - and not only after February 24, but also from 2014. That's when it all started. For there to be responsibility for aggression, a Special Tribunal is needed - in addition to the International Criminal Court. And we are doing everything to create such a tribunal. Today, the address of the First Lady of Ukraine to the Parliament and the people of Great Britain was dedicated to this task exactly. Olena's visit to the United Kingdom is currently underway. And on behalf of all Ukrainian men and women who suffered from Russian aggression, she called on Great Britain to become a leader in global efforts to establish a Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine and to restore justice. The British have this experience, it is part of our shared historical memory. In the winter of 1942, when no one could predict when World War II would end, it was in London that representatives of the Allies signed the Declaration of St. James's Palace. The document that started the path to the Nuremberg trials, that is, to justice after that war. Now we already have strong cooperation with the Netherlands, which is helping with the creation of a prosecutor's office to collect evidence of war crimes. We are working with France, which helps us in field work to document Russian evil. And we must unite the world majority in support of the draft resolution of the UN General Assembly regarding the Special Tribunal. We must develop the necessary legal architecture to make the tribunal work. We must fully implement this clause of our Peace Formula and really ensure justice after this war, just as after the Second World War. I believe that Great Britain will show its leadership precisely in this struggle for justice. Today, the Russian War Crimes exhibition was opened in London - this is a project that demonstrates to the world what Russia has brought to Ukrainian soil. This exhibition worked in Davos, during the World Economic Forum, also in New York - during the UN General Assembly, in Brussels, at the headquarters of NATO. Now the British will see it. All leading countries will know and see what evil Russism is responsible for. A meeting of justice ministers of the G7 countries was held in Berlin - an extremely useful one. Ukraine was represented there by the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Justice of our country. This meeting was devoted precisely to bringing the occupiers and the aggressor state to justice for everything they have done. Following the meeting, we can see an obvious willingness to work together to eventually restore the force of international law, restore the full effect of the UN Charter and bring Russia to a fair liability. I spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz today - it is Germany that chairs the G7 this year. We discussed our cooperation both at the bilateral level and in international institutions. The priorities are clear - protection against missile terror, energy restoration, food security. I thanked the Chancellor for his support. The situation at the front is difficult. Despite extremely big Russian losses, the occupiers are still trying to advance in the Donetsk region, gain a foothold in the Luhansk region, move in the Kharkiv region, they are planning something in the south. But we are holding out and - most importantly - do not allow the enemy to fulfill their intentions. They said they would capture the Donetsk region in spring, summer, autumn... Winter begins this week already. They wasted their regular army there, they lose hundreds of mobilized and mercenaries there every day, they use barrier troops there… This year, Russia will lose a hundred thousand of its soldiers killed and only God knows how many mercenaries. And Ukraine will stand. And the world will do everything to ensure that everyone guilty of this criminal war is brought to justice. And I also want to thank the Netherlands for today's decision - the House of Representatives of the States General recognized Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. Step by step, the world will put everything in its place. Glory to all who fight for freedom! Glory to all who work for our victory! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I held another meeting of the Staff today. The main issues are the Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Kharkiv region, Zaporizhzhia region, Kherson region, Crimea, frontline territories and our state border. We are analyzing the intentions of the occupiers and are preparing a countermeasure - an even more powerful countermeasure than now. We considered the issue of providing for the military and supplying new equipment and ammunition. I separately held a meeting on energy and communication issues. We record the results of what has already been done to protect our systems. We are preparing new solutions. We are also preparing new solutions to prevent any opportunity for Russia to manipulate the internal life of Ukraine. We will provide details in due time. As of this evening, about 6 million subscribers in most regions of our country and in Kyiv are disconnected from electricity. The situation remains very difficult in the capital, as well as in the Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Lviv, Odesa, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy regions. Energy workers and utility workers, all our services are doing everything to stabilize the system and give people more energy for longer. And I want to emphasize once again: it is very important that people understand when and for what period of time they will be left without electricity. This is the responsibility of both the energy companies themselves and local authorities. People have a right to know. And to the extent that it is possible now, the predictability of life should be ensured. People see that in neighboring houses or on nearby streets, for some reason, the rules regarding light are different. And there should be justice and clarity. Today we have two very important pieces of international news. Canada has successfully completed the issuance of special bonds - bonds of sovereign support of Ukraine. The volume is 500 million Canadian dollars. In fact, Canada assumes this debt to help our nation. The funds will go to the state budget of Ukraine. I am grateful to our Canadian friends and personally to Mr. Justin Trudeau and Mrs. Chrystia Freeland for this manifestation of Canadian leadership. Leadership that demonstrates to other partners what can be effective right now to support Ukraine. And news from Germany. The Bundestag voted for a resolution recognizing the Holodomor as genocide of the Ukrainian people. This is a decision for justice, for truth. And this is a very important signal to many other countries of the world that Russian revanchism will not succeed in rewriting history. We would praise one more decision of Germany, which will certainly become historic, - to transfer the Patriot system to Ukraine. All generations of Ukrainians will thank Chancellor Scholz, as well as the entire generation of modern German politicians. Glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Gratitude to everyone who helps our state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Free people of the indomitable country! Every year on December 1, we recall an event that defined history. An event that said a lot about all of us, about Ukrainians. About who we are. And about who we will never become. On December 1, 31 years ago, a referendum was held that united the entire territory of our state. None of our people remained outside the All-Ukrainian decision. Kyiv and Sevastopol, Odesa and Crimea, Lviv and Cherkasy, Chernihiv and Kharkiv, Donetsk and Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk, Khmelnytskyi and Kirovohrad regions, Volyn and Dnipropetrovsk regions, Sumy and Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil, Zhytomyr region and Chernivtsi, Vinnytsia, Kyiv region, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Rivne... Everyone expressed their support. People confirmed the Act of Proclamation of Independence of Ukraine - freely and legally. It was a real referendum, not some kind of imitation. It was an honest referendum, and that is why it was recognized by the world. And it was important that not just politicians, but people in particular put an end to the history of the empire, which was built on denying the will of the people. Which killed, trying to perpetuate the denial of the will of the people, but which was overthrown by people anyway. And precisely by their own will. Since that day in 1991, Ukrainians have experienced many attempts to turn a dot into three dots or a semicolon. We saw many figures who could not put up with the fact that the empire had been overthrown. We are still defending Ukraine against such \"comrades\" who wanted to celebrate the centenary of the empire this year instead of another anniversary of freedom. They wanted... But Ukrainian rules will prevail. Our desire to live freely expressed on August 24 and confirmed on December 1 will not be broken. Ukrainians will never again be gears of some empires. We have already gained it and we will ensure the full independence of our state. We will ensure, in particular, spiritual independence. We will never allow anyone to build an empire inside the Ukrainian soul. A meeting of the National Security and Defense Council was held today. The meeting at which we considered numerous facts of connections of certain religious circles in Ukraine with the aggressor state. Unfortunately, even Russian terror and full-scale war did not convince some figures that it is worth overcoming the temptation of evil. Well, we have to create conditions where no actors dependent on the aggressor state will have an opportunity to manipulate Ukrainians and weaken Ukraine from within. So, first. The National Security and Defense Council instructed the Government to submit to the Verkhovna Rada a draft law on making it impossible for religious organizations affiliated with centers of influence in the Russian Federation to operate in Ukraine. Second. The State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience was commissioned to ensure the religious examination of the Management Statute of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for the presence of a church-canonical connection with the Moscow Patriarchate and, if necessary, to take measures provided for by law. Third. Ensure the verification of the presence of legal grounds and compliance with the conditions of use by religious organizations of the property located on the territory of the National Kyiv-Pechersk Historical and Cultural Reserve. Fourth. All bodies responsible for ensuring national security must intensify measures to identify and counter the subversive activities of Russian special services in the religious environment of Ukraine. And apply personal sanctions - the surnames will be made public soon. And fifth. We need to raise the status and strengthen the capabilities of the State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience. This structure will be reformed, which will enable it to really protect the rights and legitimate interests of the Ukrainians and the state. With these and other decisions, we guarantee Ukraine's spiritual independence. I would like to emphasize: in 1991, our state embarked on the legal and democratic path. We will continue this path. Only legal steps. Balanced decisions. And national interests. Today, we continued to work on the implementation of the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which I presented at the G19 summit, in particular its clause on food security. To this end, I spoke with the President of Senegal and the Chairperson of the African Union. About our Grain From Ukraine initiative. This is an initiative that really brings stability and predictability back to the world. And also about the way we can involve African countries in restoring the strength of international law and guaranteeing the completeness of global security. And one more thing. Today, another 50 Ukrainians were brought home from Russian captivity. Four officers, 46 sergeants and privates. Army, territorial defense, national guards, Navy and border guards. I thank our entire team, which works for the liberation of Ukrainians. Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Malyuk, Lubinets. Well done. I am grateful to everyone who helps! In total, since February 24, more than 1,300 Ukrainians have already been returned from Russian captivity. We will bring back all the rest! All of Ukraine will be free. All Ukrainians will be at home. Glory to all who fight for our country! Glory to all who work to protect Ukraine! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for independence! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good night, dear Ukrainians! It was a special day of a special week. The nicest, the most symbolic thing is that today I had a privilege to honor with awards our heroes released from Russian captivity and members of our team – those who are working for the return of Ukrainians home. Now I want to thank once again everyone who is doing this task. A total of 1,331 – so many have been already released during the full-scale war. And we will not leave a single Ukrainian in Russian prisons, camps and \"isolation.\" We remember everyone. The day will come – we will welcome them again free. All this week, we worked at various levels in European capitals in order to gain a critical mass of support for the launch of a special tribunal – a tribunal on Russian aggression. London, Paris, Berlin, Warsaw and other capitals... We are strengthening our position everywhere, accumulating the support of our partners. I am sure that there will be a tribunal, there will be justice. We are moving quite actively with regard to another point of the Ukrainian peace formula – food security. We use every day so that the world sees and feels that global stability is possible only together with Ukraine. Today, the third vessel within the framework of our initiative Grain from Ukraine entered the port of Odesa. 25,000 tonnes of humanitarian wheat will be sent to Somalia. The second vessel, which is finishing loading in the port of Chornomorsk, will be heading to Ethiopia with 30,000 tonnes of wheat on board. Also, the first vessel under this program – Grain from Ukraine – is heading to Ethiopia. And in general, by the end of spring, we will send about 60 vessels with such humanitarian cargo. It literally saves millions of people from starvation. And I am grateful to all our partners who joined the Ukrainian initiative. Another initiative of ours – grain export – made it possible to bring almost 13 million tonnes of Ukrainian foodstuffs to the food market. A significant contribution to world security. We are doing everything to increase the supply. Today, I want to mention all those who are returning normal life to the liberated areas, in particular to Kherson region and the city of Kherson. These are people from different regions – everyone has united, responded to the call for relief... These are our energy workers, builders, communications workers, repair crews, businesses, local leaders, mine clearance specialists. More than 200 explosive devices were found in just a few days this week. Demining continues. In Kherson region, every week there is more mobile communication coverage, more electricity and gas supply, more transport opportunities. Every week more access to normal medicine, educational and social services. Today, the broadcast of the Ukrainian telethon Edyni Novyny also started in Kherson. I thank everyone who, despite constant Russian shelling and various attempts by terrorists to make difficulties for us, is doing everything so that Ukrainians can live – live normally. And one more. These days we celebrate the 300th anniversary of the birth of Hryhorii Skovoroda – our philosopher, who taught happiness and self-knowledge, finding one's true self in this world. Today, I visited Pereiaslav, Kyiv region. Places where Skovoroda lived and taught. It would be funny if it weren't bitter that the occupiers are trying to steal this Ukrainian from Ukraine. They say something there, as if Skovoroda is theirs. But we know that they will not catch him. How it's impossible to catch, stop, break and capture Ukraine. These days we have taken some steps to guarantee the spiritual independence of our people. I see that people support these steps. And I see very powerful support. And that's not all. There will be more steps. Ukraine will never stop halfway again. Glory to all who fight and work for our country! I thank everyone who defends and helps our people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I held another meeting of the Staff. The commanders reported on the situation in specific directions – in the most important directions. In Donetsk region – Bakhmut, Soledar – now, as before, it's the hottest, most painful. We do everything to help our boys in this direction. Our heroes who are holding the defense there. Everyone there deserves the highest gratitude! And now I would like to separately thank the border guards of the Chop detachment, who are fighting near Bakhmut and today \"landed\" another plane of the occupiers. Luhansk region and Kharkiv region – we're strengthening our forces. South – we continue to erase the capabilities of the occupiers. Border – we're strengthening the entire perimeter. Black Sea water area – we're working so that finally Kalibr missiles could be at least at the bottom of the sea. Of course, we discussed further steps in the area of total spiritual independence of Ukraine and protection of our state from informal networks of influence of the terrorist state. A separate conversation at the meeting of the Staff is about energy. Recovery progress and object protection. We are constantly working on it. The discussion on price caps, i.e. on limiting the export price of Russian oil, has ended in the world. Unfortunately, without big decisions, as you wouldn't call it a big decision to set such a limit for Russian prices, which is quite comfortable for the budget of a terrorist state. Russia has already caused huge losses to all countries of the world by deliberately destabilizing the energy market. And the world cannot dare its real energy disarmament. It's a weak position. And it's only a matter of time when stronger tools will have to be used anyway. It is a pity that this time will be lost. The logic is obvious: if the price limit for Russian oil is $60 instead of, for example, $30, which Poland and the Baltic countries talked about, then the Russian budget will receive about a hundred billion dollars a year. This money will go not only to the war and not only to Russia's further sponsoring of other terrorist regimes and organizations. This money will also be used to further destabilize precisely those countries that are now trying to avoid big decisions. Today, I held a meeting with the leaders of our foreign policy bloc. We summed up the week and are preparing new events for December and January. Very powerful steps. Ukraine's position will be heard, Ukraine's interests will be realized despite everything. And one more. Yesterday I spoke with students of universities: Skovoroda University in Pereiaslav, Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, Skovoroda Kharkiv National Pedagogical University. Three institutions out of many that keep the memory of Skovoroda and preserve Ukrainianness itself. And today I also visited the exhibition \"The World of Skovoroda\" at the Ukrainian House in Kyiv. And it is right that in such conditions, in such a year, events for the 300th anniversary of Skovoroda are taking place all over the country. It is right that there is strength, there is the strength to take care of Ukrainian in all its manifestations. Because our victory is being achieved by the strength of arms and the strength of the spirit. The strength of the soldiers and the strength of the people. The strength of the state and the strength of culture. The strength of our unity is our ability to work together for the sake of Ukrainian interests and our ability to support each other. Support, because we are Ukrainians, and the strength of this argument alone should be enough for all of us. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to all who work for our country! Eternal memory and respect to all those who gave their lives for independence! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Indomitable people of an indomitable country! The fourth day of this winter is coming to an end. The winter, which will obviously be difficult. But still, it is worth perceiving this winter not as a test, but as time - time that brings us closer to the main thing - to victory. Each of these 90 winter days. The enemy really hopes to use winter against us: to make winter cold and hardship part of his terror. We have to do everything to endure this winter, no matter how hard it is. And we will endure. To endure this winter is to defend everything. Russia still has missiles and an advantage in artillery. Yes, but we have something that the occupier does not have and will not have. We defend our home, and that gives us the strongest motivation possible. We fight for freedom, and that always multiplies any force. We defend the truth, and this unites the whole world around Ukraine. We see happy people when they meet the Ukrainian flag in liberated cities - wherever Ukraine returns. The people, the Armed Forces, all of us return. And this means they are waiting for us wherever there is still an occupation. They are waiting and they believe that Ukraine will return. They are waiting and they know very well: if Russia invades, it will not be forever. To get through this winter, we have to help each other more than ever and care for each other even more. And please don't ask if you can help, and how. Just help when you see you can. To get through the winter, we have to be even more resilient and even more united than ever. There can be no internal conflicts and strife, which can weaken us all, even if someone out there thinks that somehow it will strengthen him personally. We need more interaction than ever. All of Ukraine has to become one big Point of Invincibility and work every day, work every night. The state, business, people - all of us, Ukrainians, all together. This autumn, a lot was done to strengthen the position of the state and to make the occupier lose. We must do everything so that the same can be said after this winter. Ukrainians worked round the clock to restore normal life after the Russian strikes. And no matter how large-scale the terror of the occupiers was, our desire to restore everything in our home was always even greater. It should continue to be so. Our defense forces firmly hold positions and even the most difficult directions. How many times have the occupiers planned to capture all of Donbas, to be in Bakhmut... How many times have they already announced new deadlines for their advance, their victories... Our guys are true heroes. And this is our key task - both for the state and the people - to do everything to support our defense forces, to strengthen our defense forces, to find everything necessary for our defense forces in the world. I know how difficult it is in Bakhmut, in Donbas. Guys, hold on! I am with you. The people are with you. In order to carry out this task - to carry it out successfully - we must always support each other, precisely for this. And I thank everyone who helps strengthen Ukraine and who after this winter will definitely be able to say that the approach of our victory is also his or her personal result, a personal achievement. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine and who work for Ukrainians! Glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Fellow Ukrainians! Today is International Volunteer Day. International, yet so Ukrainian. This is the day of millions of our people. Not hundreds, not thousands, but millions. This is the day of everyone who helps defend the state. Everyone who helps protect the people. All those who give their soul, time, and money for Ukraine and Ukrainians to succeed. To win. The volunteer movement in our country rose in waves from Maidan, from 2014 and from February 24. The waves that were getting higher and stronger. Today, volunteers are the most powerful part of Ukrainian civil society. This is a movement that unites all cities and communities of our country and all social groups. And this is an idea that attracts millions of people from different countries of the world to the Ukrainian struggle for freedom. Today is the day of very famous organizations, whose names every Ukrainian has heard, and the day of people whose names do not yet sound throughout the country, but who, together with everyone, will feel that this is their result on the day of our victory. This is the day of Veteran Hub and Army SOS, “Zgraya” and “Aerorozvidka”, KSE Foundation and those who founded and help “Nebesna Gvardiya” project. The day of \"Hospitallers\" and all paramedics and doctors who help at the front. This is the day of \"Kryla Peremogy\" and NGO \"Zemliachky\", “Povernys Zhyvym\" and \"Motohelp\" foundations, Serhiy Prytula Foundation and the Volunteer Hundred of Dobrovolia, \"Kolo\" and \"Solomyanski Kotyky\" foundations, the Marlog Center and the Ukrainian Volunteer Service, Razom for Ukraine, \"Narodny Tyl\" association, Help Army volunteer group and the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. This is the day of United24 and each of the more than a hundred countries who help us buy ambulances or naval drones. This is the day of star ambassadors who have also become volunteers and direct the power of the world for Ukraine. Today is the day of Kharkiv “Pidtrymka Zakhysnykiv” Foundation and Lviv NGO “Nezalezhni”, the day of the Union of Ukrainian Women from the Ivano-Frankivsk region and the Kramatorsk Center “Razom do Peremohy”, “Angely Spasinnia” Foundation from the Donetsk region and  NGO “Miskyi Tsentr Dopomohy” from Zaporizhzhia. This is the day of SpivDiia and PLAST, NGO \"Ridne Polissia\", the Active Rehabilitation Group, the Ukrainian Women's Battalion, \"Kotyky-Patriotyky\" and \"Dobra Sprava\", Let's help, \"Kharkiv z Toboyu\" foundations, HopeUA, \"Tvoya Opora\", \"My z Ukrainoyu\" and \"Rayon Nomer 1\". And also the day of Yevhen Subota, coordinator of volunteer centers in Hostomel. Ulyana Hredil from NGO \"Apostolska Chota\". NGO \"Zakhyst - Obyednannia Volonteriv\". Yulia Konovalova, head of NGO \"Liudy Usiudy\" and volunteer of the World Central Kitchen project. Volodymyr Firman, rector of Zarvanytsia Marian Spiritual Centre. This is the day of the Ukrainian Catholic University and dozens of universities and student communities in our country and abroad, which have joined the defense of our state, freedom and people. And humanity. That's why today we thank organizations like Zoopatrol and UAnimals, and everyone who knows that saving animals is also saving souls. You probably know most of these names, you may have already helped some of these organizations and projects. But the volunteer movement is much larger and broader. These are thousands of structures, tens of thousands of people who care and millions of those who join. This is the day of those who were looking for bulletproof vests on Maidan and continued to look for and deliver everything that might be necessary for the frontline. This is the day of those who make camouflage nets: Lviv, Rivne and thousands of other Ukrainian cities and villages, tens of thousands of people. This is the day of ordinary Ukrainians who help us all solve very difficult tasks. They help restore the energy sector after strikes. Return normal life to the de-occupied territory. This is the day of those who provide rehabilitation and prosthetics. Who provide psychological help. Who support displaced persons. Who help those released from captivity. Who bake bread for the military and deliver food to the most dangerous places. This is the day of the drivers who helped with the evacuation and the delivery of the humanitarian aid. This is the day of many different people who all together strengthen Ukraine. This is the day of thousands of Ukrainian businesses that made their projects to help the army and ordinary people or joined existing volunteer programs. And the day of businessmen who do everything to strengthen Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, not Monaco and Vienna. Although the volunteer movement has become part of the foundation of Ukraine, we did not have a special award that could become a symbol of our gratitude to volunteers and those who give strength to this movement. Who give a part of their own life to help save the lives of others. Now there is such an award. This is the heart. The heart of gold for the ordinary people who protect us all. This year, we establish such an award. For those who really deserve it. Those whose hearts are of gold, and that is why they are volunteers. Today I named 50 volunteer groups whose representatives will receive an award this year. And every year we will celebrate volunteer projects, other organizations, and new personalities. People should know who provides this aid for Ukraine. People should know whose heart gives us such a result, for which Ukrainians are grateful. Glory to everyone who helps our defense! Glory to everyone who helps our volunteers! Gratitude to everyone who is involved in the work of the volunteers! And congratulations on Volunteer Day! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report on the day. The main result - 70 Russian missiles were launched, most of them were shot down. Kalibr, Kh-101, etc. I am grateful to all our warriors of the air commands \"East\", \"South\" and \"Center\". Well done! I am also grateful to our partners for the air defense systems we are currently using. Every downed Russian missile is concrete proof that terror can be defeated. But, unfortunately, we still cannot ensure complete security to our sky - there were several hits. Unfortunately, there are victims. As of this time, there are four people killed by Russian strikes today. My condolences to families and friends. Energy workers immediately started restoration. Maximum efforts are in the central regions of Ukraine, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions. In many regions we had to switch to emergency shutdowns to stabilize the system. From Zakarpattia to Kyiv region, from Kirovohrad region to Sumy and Kharkiv regions. As of this evening, the biggest number of shutdowns is in Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy regions. But we will do everything to restore stability. Russian terror again affects neighboring states. There are interruptions with electricity supply in Moldova again. And this once again proves that Russia's ability to carry out such massive terrorist attacks is a threat not only to Ukraine, but also to our entire region. At least. When one terrorist destabilizes everyone's lives, stopping terror is a joint task. Tonight I will talk about this in my address to the expert community of the American Institute for the Study of War and to all our friends in the United States. By the way, with today’s missile attack Russia marked the anniversary of the Budapest Memorandum. The fate of this document gives answers to many current questions about Russia. Simply signing something with these terrorists will not bring peace. They will certainly break any agreements reached with them. Giving up any element of someone else’s security to Russia means new war. Therefore a principled continuation of the existing policy of conscientious states of the world is necessary: it is only the dismantling of Russian terrorist capacities, liberation of all our territories and holding the murderers to account that will bring peace. I believe we will come to this. Another result of today is a new declaration of support for Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic course. This is the third such declaration. Today it was signed with Montenegro. After the Czech Republic and Belgium. We will complete this path step by step - we will persuade the Euro-Atlantic majority in favor of Ukraine. And not just in words, but in decisions. In decisions to support our accession to the collective security system. And one more thing Finally, a special award for extraordinary people appeared in Ukraine - for Ukrainian volunteers. \"Gold Heart\". Today, greeting the volunteer community, I named the first 50 teams and individuals who will receive this new award shortly. But this is far from a complete list of those who deserve it. The state should know how to be grateful and express gratitude. And it will. Glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Gratitude to everyone who helps our state hold out against Russian terror! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by terrorists! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Glory to Ukraine! Gentlemen, generals, officers, sergeants, soldiers! Fellow Ukrainians! Dear attendees! Today is the day of our gratitude. This is exactly the meaning of December 6 - and it is forever. Now, this is the only way our people will celebrate the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - with words of gratitude, feelings of gratitude, tears of gratitude. I am sure, millions of times today \"thank you\" was said or simply thought in Ukraine. I am thankful to the warriors of our army and all formations of the defense forces of Ukraine. I am thankful to the parents of our warriors who raised real winners. That's that - winners. I am thankful to all the doctors and nurses who save the wounded heroes. I am thankful to everyone who strengthens the defense and provides Ukrainian warriors with everything they need. When the Day of the Armed Forces in a state is a holiday of gratitude, I am sure that such a state cannot be defeated and cannot be broken. And today we all see it for sure and have seen it again. Dear attendees! For 8 years and 286 days, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been defending our beautiful state from the occupier, from Russian aggression. Thousands of Ukrainians gave their lives for the day to come when not a single occupier remains on our land and all our people are free again. I ask you now to honor with a moment of silence the memory of everyone who died on the battlefield for the sake of our state, for the sake of Ukraine, and whose life became part of the heroic history of courage of Ukraine. Fellow Ukrainians! Today it is an honor for me to spend the whole day together with our defenders. In the morning, I was in the Donetsk region - I thanked the fighters who defend our state in the most dangerous and responsible directions. Those who are fighting in Svatove, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and other directions in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. I presented state awards and decorations to the warriors. I was in the Kharkiv region today - I thanked the doctors who save our indomitable fighters. In the Kharkiv region, I presented awards to the fighters who participated in the liberation of the region and who continue to expel the occupiers from Ukraine. Today we managed to bring home another 60 warriors who were in Russian captivity. We will continue to return our people and free everyone. Now here, in the Mariyinsky Palace, are our heroes, relatives of our warriors, commanders and representatives of combat brigades and units who have just arrived from the front and are returning to the frontline again. Where it's really hot. Where they really fight for our freedom, for our independence, for our children. And I want to say to everyone present what is definitely in the heart of every Ukrainian today: I thank you! I thank absolutely all soldiers, all sailors, all sergeants, sergeant-majors, all officers, all heroes, generals and, of course, all your fathers and mothers, our dear, esteemed Ukrainian warriors. I wish you all one thing - victory! To all of us. You deserve it! All our people deserve it. All our parents, our children deserve it. Our state and history deserve it. To finally gain victory. Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear friends! As I record this address, our 286th day of defense in full-scale war is ending. And this is not just an ordinary day – it is a holiday of our Armed Forces. A day celebrated by millions of Ukrainians – on their land, in their state, under their flag. Just feel it – the 286th day of a full-scale war against an aggressor that many in the world thought was invincible… And we celebrate the Day of OUR Armed Forces, not a sort of some kind a day of the occupiers. On February 23 of this year, a day before the escalation of the Russian war, madame Madeleine Albright published an opinion editorial that the Russian leader was making a historic mistake. These were prophetic words. He really made a mistake – the biggest in his life and the lives of modern generations of Russians. But, friends, we all know that the \"haunted idea\" of any dictatorship is to ignore mistakes and pretend that there were no mistakes, especially when it comes to the first-person error of the dictatorship. This is exactly how Russia is behaving now. Obviously, the dictator lost. But he is doing everything to ensure that Russia continues to fight if only to avoid admitting to himself and others that a historical mistake has been made. If Russia feels backed into a corner, it has only itself to blame. Ukraine and the free world should definitely not change their goals and exchange their values for some compromises, if the dictatorship is afraid to admit a mistake and tempts with a break in the battles. We must fully protect freedom and guarantee the security of our democracy. Whoever started an unprovoked and criminal war must lose and bear responsibility. Ukraine and the world must receive guarantees of peace, stability and security. Celebrating today the Day of our Armed Forces we feel we can provide this. And therefore, we must! Apart from the Ukrainian victory, any other option will be a mistake, and this must be honestly admitted. That is why we need to continue to have the same strong American leadership that we have seen during these 286 days and always. I believe that it will be so. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for this honorable title! And thank you to every American for always helping those who fight for freedom! God Bless America! God Bless Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! I greet you from Ukraine and thank you for supporting our fight for freedom! I want you to know what this support means. What American aid means to our defense against Russian terror. This is an opportunity for every Ukrainian to feel that freedom will reign on our land, and not the brutality of the occupier. This is an opportunity for every Ukrainian father and mother to be sure that child will choose his or her own path in life, and it will be a free life, not an endless fear of dictatorship. When we ask for support, it is always a request from people to people. On February 24, Russia started a total war against us, and this is a war for survival. Hundreds of our cities and villages were simply burned to the ground by Russian strikes. We have already managed to free from occupation one thousand eight hundred and eighty eight settlements. But almost as many Ukrainian towns and villages remain under occupation. And this means that now the fate of millions of people is being decided on the battlefield in Ukraine. Millions – who can be saved. We have no right to leave even a single Ukrainian under the Russian occupation! Not in Russian filtration camps, where thousands have already disappeared. And not on Russian territory, where hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians were forcibly deported... We can free them. This is our hope. This is what your support means. This is not about politics, this is about life. I will repeat these words once again – this is not about politics, this is about life. Isn't that what real democracy is all about? There are always moments when it is necessary to say: this is not about politics, this is about life. There are always times when you need to support – because support means much more than just giving or doing something. Now is that very time – when support literally means saving, saving millions of people, millions of fathers and mothers, millions of children. And I am grateful to you for being with us – for the fact that the United States of America really support Ukraine. I believe that thanks to your support in particular, we will be able to say one day that all Ukraine is finally free and safe from Russian terror. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for the ripple of hope that we raised together this year!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a long and hard day. The Kherson region - four policemen died during stabilization measures... Russian mines. Among the dead was Mykhailo Kuratchenko, chief of police of the Cherkasy region. He was helping colleagues in the south. EOD technician Ihor Melnyk. Dog trainer Serhiy Nenada. Assistant duty officer of the Uman district police department Vadym Perizhok. Doctors are currently saving the lives of four more policemen. Police forces along with all the defense forces of our state are now on the frontline. And together with everyone they protect Ukrainians, together with everyone they suffer losses... My condolences. The Donetsk region - today the Russian army carried out a very brutal, absolutely deliberate strike at Kurakhove. Precisely at civilians. At ordinary people. At the market, elevator, gas station, bus station, residential building. The list of the dead so far includes ten people, there are many wounded. My condolences to relatives and friends... Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror! I’ve held a meeting of the Staff today. Commanders' reports, analysis of the situation in specific directions. First of all, regarding the Donetsk region, Bakhmut districts and other hottest spots. A very fierce confrontation is ongoing there, every meter counts. I thank all our guys who destroy the enemy right there - every day, every night, every hour. Of course, due attention was paid to the Luhansk region and Kharkiv region at the Staff’s meeting, there were reports on the situation in general and on the borders. Energy sector is a permanent item on our agenda - both at the Staff and government levels. I’ve also held a meeting on the stabilization of the energy system and the protection of our power plants. We are constantly increasing the generation and supply of electricity - we are adding more volume almost every day. But we should not forget - and everyone should not forget - that it is now impossible to restore 100% of the energy system as it was before the beginning of the Russian energy terror. We need time. That is why shutdown schedules remain in most cities and districts. As of this evening, the biggest number of shutdowns is in Kyiv and the region, Lviv region, Zhytomyr region, Khmelnytskyi region, Poltava region, Vinnytsia region and Zakarpattia. And I thank all our energy workers, repairmen, businesses, utility workers and local authorities who are doing everything they can to make things easier for people. By the way, today is the Day of Local Self-Government. This is a holiday for all those who work with people directly and on whom almost everything in communities depends. As in any government, in local self-government there are different people of different personal qualities and views. And today I thank all those who, at their level, really protect their communities. Who can be trusted and to whom people come for help. Who really takes care of the defense - within their responsibility - and who prepares everything so that his or her community can get through this winter more easily. Thank you and congratulations on your professional day. Today we have a very important result in France. The Supreme Court of France upheld the decision on recovery in favor of the Ukrainian Oschadbank from the aggressor state. The amount with accrued interest is almost 1.5 billion dollars. This legal process has been dragging since 2015. More than six years of struggle, tens of thousands of pages of legal documents, many hopes and no less skepticism expressed by some... But there is this victory for Ukraine. Russia will be held to account for all stolen assets of the Ukrainian state and companies. This is the first victory for a state-owned company in the legal cases against Russia concerning the seized property in Crimea, and I thank each and every one who secured this result. Today, representatives of the Office and the government took part in a conference in America - a conference dedicated to the creation of a special tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Similarly, not everyone in the world agrees now that this tribunal will work. But no matter what they say, we will do our part and will definitely achieve a result for Ukraine and Ukrainians. We are already preparing for the events of the second half of the week - at the international level. There will be important decisions for our defense. We do everything to make them stronger. I am grateful to all partners of our country! Glory to all who work for the victory! Glory to each of our warriors - to all those who obtain life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! I thank you for this award to the Ukrainian people. And I mean it – it is destined to all Ukrainians. Because leaders can be truly influential only when they represent not only themselves, but the common will, common dream, common goal of their people. This is how we live in Ukraine. We are as united as possible – and that is why we are that strong. We are focused on protecting our independence – and that is why we are achieving our goals. We have faced the threat of losing everything – and that is why we have found the strength to become number one. The Ukrainian military, who protect us all on the battlefields, are number one. Maryinka, Avdiivka, Bakhmut, Soledar, Kreminna – please remember these names... that is where freedom is now being fought for. For all of us in Europe. In hard battles and at the cost of many lives. Ukrainian businessmen who, despite the total war, supply everything necessary for the life of the country, protect jobs and pay taxes, are number one. And I thank all our friends in Europe who help us maintain stability. Ukrainian doctors, energy workers, sappers, volunteers, drivers and builders, defense workers, teachers, policemen, diplomats... Hundreds of thousands of those who help millions live through this terrible time – they are number one. And it is an honor for me to represent all these people. All Ukrainians. And guide our common will for our common dream. For the sake of a common goal... For the sake of Ukraine's victory in this war. For the sake of rebuilding Ukraine. For the full accession of Ukraine to the community of European nations – to our European Union. I believe that Ukrainians will be the most influential next year as well. But – already in peacetime. Thanks to everyone who supports us! Thank you, Politico, for being always unbiased!"

  "speech": "Fellow Ukrainians! I have just signed the decrees on awarding posthumously the policemen whose lives were taken yesterday in the Kherson region by Russian mines. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to police colonel Mykhailo Kuratchenko. Orders \"For Courage\" - to police captains Ihor Melnyk and Serhiy Nenada and police corporal Vadym Perizhko. Once again, my condolences… They did everything for the safety of Ukrainians. Already returning after completing one of the tasks, when they removed weapons and ammunition from the cache of the occupiers, many of which were left in the Kherson region, the policemen stumbled upon a mine trap. And this is the form of Russian terror that will have to be countered for years to come. Terrorists deliberately try to leave behind as many death traps as possible. Buried landmines, tripwire mines, mined buildings, cars and infrastructure... This is more than 170 thousand square kilometers of dangerous territory. I am sure: this will be among the charges against Russia for aggression - precisely mine terror. Which is even more cruel and meaner than a missile one, because there is no anti-mine system that could destroy at least part of the threat, as our air defense does. I am grateful to all our partners who help Ukraine with demining. Canada, Japan, Great Britain, Slovakia, ambassadors and donors of United24 and many others who understand how important it is that Ukraine is not left alone with the problem of the territory mined by the occupiers. I met today with representatives of Slovakia, the government delegation - ministers of foreign affairs, defense and economy. We discussed the existing cooperation between our states both at the bilateral level and in the structures of the European Union. We agreed on new solutions for the sake of our common security and political interests. We are actively working to support and strengthen the next sanctions against Russia – by European, American and other partners. The issue of the ninth EU sanctions package is currently in progress. We are also waiting for other decisions, in particular, regarding schemes for circumventing anti-war sanctions, including financial and energy ones. We are preparing several important events - for tomorrow and next week. Protecting and restoring the rights of our people, rebuilding Ukraine are constant priorities. The next week will be quite important for Ukraine in terms of these two tasks. I thank all those who fight for freedom! I thank everyone who strengthens our state and helps our people! Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! It is an honor for me – to represent the struggle of Ukrainians and the Spirit of Ukraine. The spirit of freedom, that echoes in the souls of so many people around the world... Stories of heroes, who are fighting for independence, are also – your stories. Ordinary men and women who became brave-hearts, when they joined the Defence Forces to defend freedom, – different generations of different nations knew this spirit. Doctors, who save the wounded under bombs, during blackouts or in occupation – no matter what it takes. It is about humanness, that we all value so dearly. Farmers, who work the land under the roaring guns. It is about natural desire to live and take care of one’s families and communities. Journalists, who spread the truth – it is in the history of how to resist tyrants. The history, which began even before the word “journalism” appeared. This is what inspires across all continents – freedom fighters, who may possess nothing, but courage to defeat those with armored vehicles and repression experience. When freedom wins and tyranny collapses, people are smiling the same way all over the globe. Lawyers, who do not yet see the upcoming victory in war, but are already working to ensure that war criminals are brought to justice, – this is the Nuremberg Trials story with many other just verdicts, that were delivered to those, who believed in their impunity. This is the spirit! You have already seen the spirit of Ukraine on the covers of Time Magazine – not on each one, but on many. They were not Ukrainians – on the covers before, but they were – courage, striving for freedom, solidarity, creativity and dedication, – values well known to the mankind from a long time ago and which united the world this year with the colors of the Ukrainian national flag and our people’s achievements. This is the free world spirit. And let's do everything for our spirit to win! I thank you for your attention! Thank you for supporting Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Mr. President Erdoğan! Mr. Prime Minister Rama! Dear friends! Thank you for your attention to Ukraine and now I would like to address the entire audience gathered by this Forum. A powerful audience. Powerful is not a random word now, it is a key word. A word that reflects our capabilities - of Ukraine, Türkiye, the Black Sea region. Capabilities right now - and in the future years and decades. The Russian war against Ukraine showed the value of stability in our region. This is one of the historical mistakes of the Russian leader - with his insane aggression, he only proved that the security of Ukraine and the Black Sea region is critically important for global security, and any aggression in our part of the world is a global crime. The food crisis that the world has experienced this year and that we are overcoming together with Türkiye and the UN fully illustrates what I am talking about. There would not be any severity of the food crisis if the Russian fleet had not blocked our ports in the Black Sea. Without the export of our food, the global market is instantly destabilized. This was felt by various countries in Africa and Asia, and this was manifested in food price fluctuations in other parts of the planet. But thanks to our brave warriors who are changing the balance of power in the confrontation with Russia and thanks to the power of diplomacy, we managed to resume sea exports from the three Black Sea ports of Ukraine. Since July of this year, we have already exported more than 13 million tons of agricultural products to 40 countries around the world. The global market felt it. In the end, it was also reflected in social stability in the respective countries consuming our food. That’s what our power is. Ukraine, Türkiye, the UN - together they are preventing the threat of famine, which so much has been said about. When we jointly take care of the security of our region, of normal life in our region, it provides, as a result, elements of global security. It provides the elements of peace that all conscientious states need. Recently, at the G19 summit in Indonesia, I presented the Ukrainian Peace Formula. A formula that can put an end to Russian aggression and restore the force of international law for Ukraine and all other nations. Food security is one of the elements of our Peace Formula. And this is something where the leadership role of Türkiye can manifest itself one hundred percent. If we manage not only to maintain the current level of agricultural exports from Ukraine and our humanitarian initiative - \"Grain From Ukraine\" - which helps the poorest countries maintain stability, but also to restore the full-fledged export of Ukrainian food in the volume that the world needs. Now there are more than 13 million tons of agricultural products for export. And we can ensure tens of millions of tons more. Our ports involved in the grain export initiative are operating at half capacity only. And this is only because Russia slows down the implementation of exports - it keeps ships waiting for \"inspections\". As of today, more than 80 ships are waiting. And this is not just something about trade. This means that hundreds of thousands of people have less food on their tables. This means that hundreds of thousands of people overpay for food. Why? Only because one state blackmails everyone with food. The average waiting period for ships is 3-5 weeks. Because of this, 2-3 million tons of Ukrainian agricultural products are under-exported every month. Does our region have the potential to solve this? It definitely has. And if we manage to eliminate several more vectors of Russian aggression against Ukraine and guarantee the safety of our Mykolaiv region, in particular the ports of the region, this will be another step towards a more complete guarantee of global food security. Is there potential for this in the Black Sea region? There is, too. This could be a move by Türkiye - a diplomatic move. Ladies and Gentlemen! The fact that we manage to implement such initiatives as the grain export initiative and the \"Grain from Ukraine\" humanitarian initiative gives us a format for implementing other similar initiatives, other points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula. The main thing is leadership. The main thing is not just to know about your power, not just to demonstrate it occasionally, but to direct its potential for the sake of peace. The Ukrainian Peace Formula is formulated in such a way that its points allow each state and each leader to choose the aspect in which the determination of this particular state and this leader can work. I suggest that all our partners choose points for themselves - so that the entire peace formula is implemented. So that step by step - as with grain initiatives - we achieve the security architecture we need. Guarantee radiation and nuclear security. Guarantee food security. Guarantee energy security, stop insane Russian missile terror. Guarantee the release of all prisoners, the return of all deportees. By the way, Türkiye and President Erdoğan have already helped us significantly with this point - we are grateful for that. The next point of our Peace Formula is to guarantee the implementation of the UN Charter and the restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Guarantee the withdrawal of Russian troops from the occupied land and thereby stop hostilities. Guarantee justice - by punishing those guilty of terror and compensating for damages. Guarantee effective countermeasures against ecocide and save the Black Sea region from environmental disasters that may become a repercussion of the Russian war. Guarantee the prevention of any escalation and the durability of peace after dismantling all elements of Russian aggression. The Ukrainian Peace Formula is clear.  Does it look unrealistic? Not at all. It looks now just as the idea of ​​renewing grain exports from our seaports looked in May of this year. Already in July, exports resumed - thanks to our joint power. Let this power work in everything else that is needed for peace! Thank you, Türkiye, for your support! Thank you, Mr. President! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear colleagues! Dear attendees, guests! Dear journalists! It is good that today there is a format of such an important Conference, exactly today - on International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the Prevention of this Crime and on the eve of Human Rights Day. On December 9, 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. And the next day, on December 10, 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 74 years, the norms of these and many other similar documents have united the world community. More than 150 countries have become parties to the Genocide Convention. More than 190 countries have endorsed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But is the world really united around the ideas that were the basis of these documents? As a matter of fact, there was no such unification around ideas, around values. We felt it after the beginning of the Russian war against people, humanity, against our state. Against all living things. We felt that many things that should work and protect against such a genocidal policy existed rather as, pardon, a formality. As a legacy from the old days that was simply dusted off when it was time for the annual celebrations. But now we are changing that. Together with everyone who today helps us, Ukraine and Ukrainians. And we are changing that not only for ourselves. This is a very important point. Again - for people, for humanity, for life. Every time we unite the world to protect Ukraine, to protect Ukrainians, every time we achieve decisions on the implementation of fundamental international norms, every time we manage to fill international institutions and rules with real power and energy, we achieve results - for Ukrainians and great results for the whole world. For everyone who may be threatened by this or that form of aggression. This or that manifestation of genocidal policy. This or that strike of terror. Defending ourselves against Russia now, we are turning the words of many conventions and declarations into concrete actions for the sake of people and, again, for the sake of humanity. By saving Ukrainians from Russia, we give hope to many other people, many other communities, other nations who feel that the same aggression could be launched against them. Working to bring the Russian Federation to just responsibility for aggression, for war crimes, for acts of its genocidal policy, we are creating mechanisms for the implementation of the norms of international law, which will actually serve to prevent international crimes and establish justice for decades after the end of this war, after our victory - the victory of Ukraine and the world. Ladies and Gentlemen! That is why we need the broadest possible cooperation. Both in our society and at the international level. The crimes of the Russian state on the territory of Ukraine and specifically against Ukrainians are unprecedented since World War II. Ukrainian cities, our towns, our villages, which the Russian artillery simply crashes into stones... Not one, not two - but dozens of such destroyed cities and villages. Aviation and missile terror, strikes by the Russian Federation, which are so reminiscent of the Nazi bombing of Britain and London. Of all the missiles launched by the Russian army since February 24, 62% were directed specifically against civilian objects, against people, against humanity. And there are also filtration camps. Real, modern torture chambers and mass burials of people were revealed. Forced deportation of Ukrainians to Russia - more than 2 million people were deported. Illegal adoption by Russian families of our Ukrainian children who were actually kidnapped from Ukraine. Criminal mobilization of Ukrainian citizens in the occupied territories into the occupation army. Mine terror against Ukrainians. Constant shelling, victims in the border area with the Russian Federation and in the frontline areas... All this is such a terrible scale of crimes committed and the destinies and lives of people destroyed. All this is a tragedy of such magnitude. To restore justice, our state needs the maximum possible cooperation of everyone - cooperation with the human rights community, with all international partners. There must be a single legal front that will overcome Russia's genocidal policy. And that is why, addressing you and every day, I call on all government officials and all representatives of civil society who care about people, who care about humanity, representatives of various organizations, representatives of international human rights organizations, agencies to work now in a coordinated manner, together at all levels, together - for the sake of restoring the rights of people violated by the war, the rights of Ukrainians and for bringing the aggressor to justice, mandatory and fair. We have to find such a formula for cooperation, so that there is a maximum result for our state and for the international legal order. And I am glad that Chris Field is present among us today - it’s my pleasure, good afternoon - President of the International Ombudsman Institute, a representative of a system whose potential can provide much more for the protection of human rights for Ukraine. Let me explain what I mean. For example, the Ukrainian Ombudsman, Mr. Dmytro Lubinets, is now very actively involved in the work of our joint team - Budanov, Yermak, Malyuk - regarding the release of our prisoners of war, the release of our civilians held captive in Russia or in temporarily occupied territories. We have already managed to return 1,331 Ukrainian warriors. And I am very proud of this result of our country. Protecting people wherever they are - we have to bring everyone back. This is our duty. And at a time when, to put it mildly, we do not see determination and concrete actions in the relevant processes from such organizations as the International Committee of the Red Cross, we have to search and find new people in new realities, new formats of interaction, new lines of cooperation. Perhaps this system - the system of ombudsmen and the international component of cooperation in this system will be able to bring us closer to the result we strive for - the return home of all Ukrainians: adults, children, prisoners of war, political prisoners - all those forcibly detained in the territory of the Russian Federation and temporarily occupied territories of our country. It's worth at least a try. I think so. We have to try to make efforts every day, because all these are steps forward to victory. Until recently, many did not believe that the ratification of one of the fundamental documents for the protection of human rights and equality of all communities, the Istanbul Convention, was possible in Ukraine. Now it is a reality in Ukraine - the convention has been ratified. Until recently, many people said that Ukraine would allegedly not be able to obtain the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. Now it is a reality. We have become closer to European institutions. I am also proud of it. I am proud of all the people who worked for such results. Until recently, talks dominated Europe that the European Union would allegedly not be able to really unite to protect our common interests, common values, our people... Until recently, skepticism about UN structures was spreading in the world. Today, we see that the European Union is capable of being truly strong and united. And the power of the UN can be directed to solve real problems - we are talking about global problems, such as the food crisis. This is what happens when we take up the cause together, when our state, Ukraine, takes up the cause. We must always keep faith in ourselves and our partners. We must be absolutely determined, principled, we must be open to cooperation with everyone who also values determination and principles. This is how we will get all the results we so desperately need for Ukraine, for Europe, and for humanity. A Special Tribunal for the crime of aggression by the Russian Federation against the state of Ukraine must be established. And I call on all of you to do everything so that the maximum majority in the UN General Assembly supports the corresponding draft resolution in order to establish this desired and necessary justice. A compensation mechanism must also be launched to provide compensation for all losses at the expense of the assets of the aggressor, at the expense of the Russian Federation, for all those who suffered from this war of Russia against Ukraine. The relevant resolution is endorsed by the UN General Assembly, and I ask everyone to contribute to its maximum implementation. All Russian murderers, all those who organized and implemented this genocidal policy and terror must be brought to justice. For this purpose, I urge you to cooperate with the Office of the Prosecutor General, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, with our partners who are investigating the crimes of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, and with the International Criminal Court. I am sure that together we will implement absolutely all of this - we will ensure justice for Ukraine, for each and every one. I thank everyone who works for the sake of Ukrainians! For the sake of life. Glory to all our heroic strong warriors! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by Russian terror! Glory to Ukraine! Thank you."

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I had an important conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak today. We coordinated our positions ahead of the summit next week. In fact, this will be the final G7 summit this year, and it will determine the priorities for the next year. We are preparing as many as possible solutions that our countries need – for Ukraine and for the G7 states. I also thanked Mr. Prime Minister and the entire United Kingdom for the constant support of our state. They discussed the situation on the front line and winter prospects on the battlefield. The front-line situation remains very difficult in the key areas of Donbas – Bakhmut, Soledar, Maryinka, Kreminna... For a long time, there is no living place left on the land of these areas that has not been damaged by shells and fire. The occupiers actually destroyed Bakhmut, another Donbas city that the Russian army turned into burnt ruins. I thank all our heroes, all soldiers and commanders who hold the front in these directions, repulse attacks and inflict significant losses on the enemy in response to the hell that entered Ukraine under the Russian flag. Today, a conference was held in Kyiv, which continued the line of events in our country and in Europe that took place this week and last week, during which we work out solutions for the sake of justice, for the sake of holding Russia accountable, and for the sake of finding formats for the release of our people, who are held captive by the occupiers. We feel support from both states and international organizations and human rights institutions. We hope to be able to announce specific details in the near future. By the way, the results of the visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to London and her speech in the British Parliament were discussed with the British Prime Minister. On behalf of our country, Olena proposed that the United Kingdom shows leadership in the issue of justice – in the creation of a special tribunal to try the crime of Russian aggression. This is one of the points of the Ukrainian peace formula, and it is very important for me to see now in international communication that global leaders have really heard Ukrainian peace proposals. Let me remind you that the peace formula consists of ten points – from nuclear security to the restoration of the territorial integrity of our state, from energy security to the return of all prisoners of war and deportees held on the territory of Russia. This is now one of the key tasks for our state – to involve the world in concrete implementation of the points of the peace formula. We must return the Ukrainian flag to all cities and communities of Ukraine, we must ensure the real responsibility of the terrorist state for this war, and we must guarantee the safety of all generations of Ukrainians after the end of this war. Every day of the heroic resistance of our Defense Forces and all our people brings closer the day when the entire Ukraine will finally experience victory, victory and peace. Real, reliable. Today, I presented the Ukrainian vision of steps towards peace at the TRT World Forum in Istanbul. There I focused on food security – on Ukrainian initiatives that add global weight to our state. This is the grain export initiative and the Grain from Ukraine initiative. Using these transparent and useful examples for our people, for the Black Sea region and for the entire global community, we show that it is quite possible to restore security. The main thing is determination. I am sure that Mr. President Erdoğan, who was at the forum, heard our position. We are already preparing for a very important next week – there will be important international events. I held relevant meetings today. I believe: there will be powerful decisions for our country. Glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thanks to everyone who works for our people! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for independence! Glory to Ukraine!"

After the night strike by Iranian drones, Odesa and other cities and villages of the region are in the dark. So far, more than 1.5 million people in Odesa are without electricity. Only critical infrastructure is connected and to the extent where it is possible to supply electricity. In total, Russian terrorists used 15 Shahed drones against Odesa. During one night on Saturday. This is the true attitude of Russia towards Odesa, towards Odesa residents – deliberate bullying, deliberate attempt to bring disaster to the city. Our sky defenders managed to shoot down 10 drones out of 15. Well done! Power engineers, repair crews, regional authorities – everyone is working non-stop to restore power. Unfortunately, the hits were critical, so it takes more than just a period of time to restore electricity... It doesn't take hours, but a few days, unfortunately. We will do everything we can to speed up the recovery. Please, while the repairs are in progress, help your friends, your neighbors, and the elderly in Odesa to find and use the Points of Invincibility. Points of Invincibility are deployed. There you can warm up, charge your equipment, get access to mobile communication, get the necessary, important support. In general, both emergency and stabilization power outages continue in various regions. The power system is now, to put it mildly, very far from a normal state – there is an acute shortage in the system. That is why there are blackout schedules. The largest number is in the Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Ternopil, Sumy, Zakarpattia, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytsky regions and in the city of Kyiv. It must be understood: even if there are no heavy missile strikes, this does not mean that there are no problems. Almost every day in different regions there are shelling, there are missile attacks, drone attacks. Energy facilities are hit almost every day. Due to losses in the system, everyone in the system has to reduce the limits. Recovery is also very difficult. But still, our energy and utility crews are doing truly heroic things, restoring in weeks what would have required months of work. And I thank each who is working to restore power and save the power system. I also thank everyone who realizes how hard it is for our defenders of the sky, how hard it is for the repair crews and very hard for the energy workers, how hard it is for everyone who protects our lives. Today, we have important news from Norway. There is a new support package from this country in the amount of $100 million. And precisely for the restoration of our energy system after these Russian strikes. I thank all Norwegians for this decision. I'm thankful to the government. In general, we receive defense, economic and very important political support from Norway, as well as a lot of humanitarian assistance. Norway also helps with the purchase of gas. We will work together on the reconstruction of Ukraine. I want to thank you once again. Today, in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, the annual ceremony of awarding the Nobel Peace Prize took place. This year, the language of Ukraine, our Ukrainian language, was heard for the first time at the ceremony – thanks to the Center for Civil Liberties and its head Mrs. Matviichuk, who became laureates of the Peace Prize. I congratulate Ms. Oleksandra, her colleagues and all Ukrainian human rights defenders on this recognition. It is symbolic that the ceremony takes place on this very day – International Human Rights Day. In Ukraine, before there was no national day of gratitude and respect for the human rights movement – all those who dedicate their lives to the protection and restoration of people's rights. Now such a day has been established and will be celebrated annually on December 10 – Human Rights Day. Earlier, I signed several more important decrees. In particular, about awarding state scholarships. And Mr. Edem Bekirov was awarded the state scholarship named after Levko Lukyanenko. This is a special scholarship with which the state supports those who were released from the captivity of the occupiers, who were saved from Russian repression. Outstanding figures of our science, culture, and art have been awarded other state scholarships. A total of 100 Ukrainian men and women. I thank everyone who works for our country! Glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine and thanks to whom we can live and work! Eternal memory to all those who died for our freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we have quite a busy day. I held a meeting of the Staff. The situation on the frontline, the restoration of the energy infrastructure, the intelligence data on the plans of the occupiers, internal challenges. We work everything out in detail. Restoration work continues in the south of our country - we are doing everything to restore the light supply to Odesa. As of this time, we managed to partially restore the supply in Odesa and other cities and districts of the region. We are doing everything to achieve the maximum possible after the Russian hits. But now the Odesa region is still among the regions with the biggest number of shutdowns. Kyiv and the region, Lviv region, Vinnytsia region, Ternopil and the region, Chernivtsi and the region, Zakarpattia, Sumy region, Dnipropetrovsk region - the situation remains very difficult. We are constantly working with partners to mitigate the situation and give our people more opportunities, more electricity. Next week will be important in this regard. The G7 summit, a conference in France on the recovery and resilience of Ukraine in the winter, events at the level of the European Union... We are preparing for participation and expecting important results. I spoke with President Macron today. It was a rather long conversation - more than an hour - and a very meaningful one. Defense, energy, economy, diplomacy... We are coordinating steps, preparing for the implementation of our peace formula - Mr. President Macron supports it, and this is very important for us. Today I also spoke with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. As always, a very specific conversation. About something that is important not only for Ukraine and Türkiye, but what is of truly global importance. We discussed the possibilities of expanding our Black Sea export corridor. I thanked for supporting our “Grain from Ukraine” humanitarian initiative. We agreed on some important joint steps for the near future. Also today - later - a conversation with President of the United States Biden is scheduled. Details and results will be announced after the end of the conversation. And one more thing. By decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, sanctions were applied against seven people. We are doing everything to ensure that the aggressor state does not have a single string of Ukrainian society to pull. Thank you to everyone who protects our country! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russian terrorists! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I thank you, Mr. Chancellor, for your words of support and for convening this summit. For the opportunity to thank all of you, dear friends, for not losing Ukraine this year! Just as for not losing Europe and the world based on fair rules. Millions of our people are fighting and working for the sake of freedom. It is thanks to your support that Ukrainian invincibility has gained so much strength. Today I want to acknowledge the leadership of each of you as well as the solidarity of the entire Group of Seven. I am grateful to the United States and all Americans for the large-scale military and economic support as well as the support with sanctions. The US has united the free world and established a solid foundation of our security solidarity. Thank you, Mr. President! Our phone call yesterday was substantive, thank you very much. I am grateful to Canada and all Canadians for making every Ukrainian feel the sheer power of our friendship. Thank you for solidarity in understanding that Russian aggression is a no local event, but a truly global threat - a threat to everyone on Earth. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I am grateful to Japan and every Japanese for the strong leadership in Asia for the sake of protecting the freedom and basic norms of international law, as well as for the solidarity over the point that no threats brought by the Russian war should ruin the lives of our nation and all other nations of this planet. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I am grateful to the United Kingdom and all of His Majesty's subjects for being the first in Europe to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons, for solidarity in building a powerful army, and for the unwavering belief in the victory over evil. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I am grateful to France and all the French people for reinforcing our artillery and for supporting Ukraine both nationally and at the level of local communities. I am grateful for your solidarity in the vision of the European future - free and equal for all the nations of our continent. Thank you, Mr. President! I am grateful to Italy and all Italians for the timely and unhesitating provision of security and financial support. I am grateful to you for solidarity in respect for human dignity, because Russia wants to deprive all free nations of their dignity, and not only in Europe. Thank you, Madam Prime Minister! I am grateful to Germany and every German for the wonderful IRISes and for everything that helps us save people and maintain social stability despite Russia’s terror. No matter how Russia would blackmail us, we are confident about German solidarity in condemning the genocidal policy of Russia remaining strong. Thank you, Mr. Chancellor! Mr. Michel! Mrs. Ursula! I thank the European Union, you personally and every EU country for uniting our community in an unprecedented way and gradually providing Europe with even more strength and confidence that freedom in Europe will not yield to any tyranny. This year, Ukraine gained the status of the EU candidate and received the much-needed economic assistance and support with sanctions from Europe. I believe we will continue to cherish this solidarity of values. Dear colleagues! I am asking you to preserve this level of solidarity for the next year. Russia continues its aggression - and therefore, the support for Ukraine must be continued. Next year just as it was this year. But we must also take long-awaited steps to accelerate the coming of peace. Let me name those steps. There are three of them. The first is a new force. Unfortunately, Russia still has the advantage in artillery and missiles. This is a fact. These capabilities of the occupying army are the ones to fuel the Kremlin's arrogance. But we can overcome this. Ukraine needs modern tanks - and I ask you to provide this defensive capability to us. It can be done right now. Ukraine needs constant artillery support with guns and shells. It will not allow escalation from the Russian’s side. We need more rocket artillery and more long-range missiles. The more effective we are with such weapons, the shorter the Russian aggression will be. The second is a new resilience. We must maintain financial, energy and social stability next year. Should we not lose in these aspects, we will win in everything else. The reliable protection of the Ukrainian energy sector from Russian missiles and Iranian drones will be the protection of the whole of Europe, because with these strikes Russia provokes a humanitarian and migration catastrophe not only for Ukraine, but for the whole EU. I call upon you to increase the assistance to Ukraine in the field of gas. The terror against our power plants forced us to use more gas than expected. This is why we need additional support over this particular winter. We are talking about the volume of about two billion cubic meters of gas – that has to be procured additionally. We must be more active with reconstruction. It will clearly demonstrate the true capabilities of the democratic system to the whole world. The third is a new diplomacy. Ukraine has always led the negotiation process and did everything to stop Russian aggression. Now we feel the opportunity to use diplomacy to bring the liberation of all our people and all our territories closer. At the G20 summit in Indonesia, I proposed the Ukrainian Peace Formula - 10 clear points that are quite realistic to implement. For the sake of peace, peace in Ukraine, in Europe, and in the world. You are all aware of those 10 points. I am grateful to you for supporting this initiative. I propose to convene a special summit - Global Peace Formula Summit - to determine how and when we can implement the points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula. I invite you, as well as other conscientious countries, to show your leadership in the implementation of the Peace Formula as a whole or some specific points in particular. I propose Russia to take a concrete and meaningful step towards a diplomatic settlement, which is being mentioned by Moscow so regularly. Very soon we’ll have holidays celebrated by billions of people. Christmas - according to the Gregorian calendar or the New Year and Christmas - according to the Julian calendar. This is the time for normal people to think about peace, not aggression. I suggest Russia to at least try to prove that it is capable of abandoning the aggression. It would be right to start the withdrawal of Russian troops from the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine this Christmas. If Russia withdraws its troops from Ukraine, it will ensure a lasting cessation of hostilities. I hope that you will support our call. Because it is in a global interest. This is part of our Peace Formula. The occupier must leave. It will certainly happen. I see no reason why Russia should not do it now – at Christmas. The answer from Moscow will show what they really want – further confrontation with the world of finally cessation of the aggression. The one who brought the war upon us has to take it away. In any case, no matter what Russia responds, it is we, the free world, who should keep the initiative just as it was throughout this year – since February 24th. I thank you for your attention! I thank Germany for this very effective chairmanship and I believe that Japan's chairmanship will be absolutely effective as well. Thank you once again for your historic support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report about the day that is coming to an end. First, I congratulated the warriors and commanders of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on their professional holiday. Today is their day. In the Mariyinsky Palace, I presented state awards - \"Gold Star\" orders, \"Cross of Combat Merit\" decorations, and other awards. And it was an emotional ceremony. There were relatives of the Heroes who gave their lives in battles against the invaders. There were warriors who would return to the frontline. And there was such a special moment when we all felt what united us and how much we were all waiting for our victory. The victory will definitely come. The second important event of the day was participation in the G7 leaders' summit. The Group of Seven. This is already the fifth such summit this year, in which Ukraine participates and fully presents its position. Today, we specifically outlined what we have to do next year. I thanked the partners and urged them to continue to help Ukraine in 2023 as they did this year. It is very important that all elements of support for our state are preserved and do not lose momentum. It is equally important to take new steps that will preempt the Russian terror. One of the main such steps is the summit, which we are planning for this winter. A summit on the implementation of our Peace Formula. No matter what the aggressor intends to do, when the world is truly united, it is the world, not the aggressor, that determines future developments. This is what we offer to all conscientious states. To everyone who values the UN Charter and simply peace. Thirdly, representatives of our state are already working in France. The head of the government, the First Lady of Ukraine and others. The key task is two conferences on the reconstruction and resilience of Ukraine, on getting through this winter. They will take place tomorrow. And also - the direction of French forces - both of the state and businesses, communities of France - to specific projects on the recovery of Ukraine. Energy sector, cities, enterprises, hospitals... So now is an important time in France for our country, and tomorrow I will also take part in the relevant events. And other extremely important things. Today, three of our EOD technicians - employees of the State Emergency Service - died in the Donetsk region during demining. My condolences to the relatives... Doctors are fighting for the lives of two more of their colleagues. It happened in Kostyantynivka, Kramatorsk district. One of our territories most contaminated by Russian landmines, tripwire mines and unexploded shells. Since February 24, employees of the State Emergency Service alone have removed more than 300,000 explosive items. The EOD technicians of the National Police removed more than 180,000 such items. And demining is also carried out by other state services and the army. And this is one of the most important areas of our communication with partners. Among other things, we must gather the maximum of global capabilities to overcome the Russian mine terror as soon as possible. And I thank once again all our partners who help. I am thankful to all our heroic employees of the State Emergency Service, our police, and the military who carry out demining. Every defused Russian mine, every disposed projectile, every detected and defused tripwire mine is the saved lives of our people. Every day we add new energy forces to Ukraine. After each Russian attack, we restore the system. As much as possible. We are doing everything to bring to Ukraine as much equipment as possible, which can compensate for the damage caused by missile hits. And I thank all Ukrainian entrepreneurs, volunteers, all our partners who help with this. But we should all be aware that Russia has not given up its terror tactics. The absence of massive missile strikes only means that the enemy is preparing for them and can strike at any time. Although it is obvious that even without light we know well where to shoot and what to liberate, Russia still hopes for blackouts. This is the last hope of terrorists... So as long as they have missiles - and Russia still has them - please take seriously all warnings from the Ukrainian military command, from our Air Force and air alarms. At all levels, we must be prepared for any hostile intentions. And we will do everything to get through this winter. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! I thank everyone who works for our victory! Glory to all who fight for independence! Eternal memory to every Ukrainian whose life was taken by this war! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you very much! Dear President Macron! Mrs. President von der Leyen! President Cassis! Prime Minister Støre! Prime Minister Hun Sen! Prime Minister Bettel! Prime Minister Fiala! Dear heads of international institutions! Prime Minister Shmyhal! Dear Olena! All attendees, ministers, ambassadors! I am glad that we are united by such a new format - such a Conference. Because this means that we are united by the ability to defeat Russian energy terror. I remember how you, Emmanuel, called me on November 1 and offered to organize such a format. There have already been massive missile strikes against our energy sector. The constant terror of Iranian drones has already begun. Russia has opened a new front against us, trying to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe of the scale of our entire country. Russia needs a blackout in Ukraine to use it as an alleged defeat of Europe and all our democratic resistance. In response, we established a new format of cooperation and do everything for the sake of the country, for the sake of Ukrainians, against blackouts, against energy terror. What do we have for today? Ukraine withstood hundreds of Russian strikes of varying intensity at our energy sector. But now most of our power plants are unfortunately damaged or destroyed by shelling. All hydroelectric power plants, all thermal power plants... God forbid, but imagine what this would mean in your countries. One of the Russian strikes provoked the shutdown of all the nuclear units of our nuclear power plants, automation was activated - fortunately, without incident. At least one and a half billion euros are needed only for the superficial quick restoration of Ukrainian energy facilities destroyed by Russian strikes. Every time, after every Russian strike, we try to restore the technical ability to generate and supply electricity. Nevertheless, every day our energy workers have to disconnect millions of Ukrainians from the supply due to a critical shortage of electricity in the general energy system. Right now, about 12 million people in almost all regions and the capital are disconnected from the supply. Unfortunately, this is a typical situation for us. And we expect new Russian strikes every day, which can dramatically increase the number of shutdowns. That is why generators and uninterruptible power sources have now become as necessary in Ukraine as armored vehicles and bulletproof vests. This is the only way to protect ordinary people and the social order in the conditions of the Russian bid for blackout. In fact, a decentralized energy generation system parallel to the main one is currently being built in Ukraine. It is being built very quickly, in all regions, by many subjects. But still, it cannot meet all the needs of Ukraine. Yes, thousands of Ukrainian enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses, social facilities continue to work thanks to generators. Yes, hospitals function on generators, hundreds of thousands of jobs have already been saved thanks to generators, the Internet and communications are insured against outages. More than 5,000 Points of Invincibility have been opened across the country - special facilities where people can warm up, charge equipment and use communications. And I am grateful to all our partners who are already helping Ukraine with the appropriate equipment to maintain such a level of energy sustainability of our state and society. But still, the key task is to preserve the main energy system of Ukraine, to guarantee its stable operation despite any Russian efforts to make Ukraine the darkest place in Europe. That is why such a format is needed. Here and now we have to agree on specific things that will not only help Ukraine endure the winter. They will also prove as clearly as possible to any anti-democratic and anti-European forces, and primarily to Russia, that Europe has learned to prevent catastrophe and protect its people. Ladies and Gentlemen! I will be as specific as possible now. First. We need several categories of equipment - these are transformers, equipment for restoring high-voltage networks, gas turbine and gas piston power units. Ukrainian representatives who are present at the Conference can inform you about all the technical characteristics of this request. Second. At least until the end of this heating season in Ukraine, we need emergency support from the European energy system. That is, the supply of electricity from the countries of the European Union to Ukraine. The volume is up to two gigawatts. For this to become possible, a decision of ENTSO-E to increase import capacity is necessary. Again, all the technical details of such a decision will be presented by our government officials who are present at the Conference. Such electricity supply support could cost around 800 million euros in current prices. This is significant. But significantly less than a blackout in Ukraine could cost us all. Therefore, I urge you to make one of the concrete results of this Conference the approval of all decisions for such support of Ukraine with the supply of electricity from EU countries. Third. By analogy with the observation missions of the IAEA, which have been agreed to be sent to all nuclear power plants of Ukraine, we call on the European Union to send special missions to the objects of critical energy infrastructure, which are involved in the energy supply of Ukraine and on which the stability of our entire region directly depends. Such EU missions could become a reliable factor in stabilizing the situation and proper international control. Fourth. Due to the destruction of power plants by terrorists, we are forced to use more gas this winter than expected. As a result, we need support in the purchase of about two billion cubic meters of gas. It is also a necessary element of our stability that needs your leadership. Fifth. Another practical result of this Conference could be an agreement on the financing of the project, which Emmanuel has already started talking about, on the purchase of LED lamps for Ukraine. This may not seem significant to someone. But 50 million such lamps will save about one gigawatt of electricity. Given that the average deficit in our power system is about two and a half gigawatts, this project could also help significantly. And sixth. We need a special permanent mechanism for coordinating efforts - the Paris Mechanism. This will make it possible to provide timely and effective responses to every challenge of Russian energy terror. Unfortunately, we do not yet have such a modern air defense system that can shoot down Russian missiles and drones one hundred percent, however we can create such a decision-making system that can one hundred percent make Russia's terrorist tactics meaningless. When the energy stability of Ukraine is guaranteed for the entire winter period, when it is guaranteed that there will be no new waves of mass migration from our country to your countries, it will also be guaranteed that no strikes, no blackouts, no search for weapons somewhere out there in Iran or elsewhere will help Russia. Russia will have to think about how to stop aggression. Finally stop. Energy is one of the keys to this. I believe that this key will be in our hands, in your hands. Thank you for your attention! Once again, thank you, Mr. President, Emmanuel, for organizing this Conference. I count on very specific decisions. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you very much. Thank you to all the attendees. Thank you, Emmanuel, for all the words - the words of support - that you just said. The words of support for our society, Ukraine. Thank you very much for the news - it is important, pragmatic, yet very important and pleasant regarding the large contribution, regarding the support for Ukraine in the amount of 1 billion - it is really very important for us. And I want to say in general, Mr. President, I feel it and thank you once again for the fact that this day really became the day of Ukraine in France. This is extremely important - and not only for our country. I am sure that now we can feel how strong we all are together - Ukrainians, French, all Europeans. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear friends! We can feel it in the way we implement our values in overcoming the ruins brought by Russia. Any tyranny leaves ruins behind. On the contrary, European democracy must guarantee well-being and security - and this is exactly what we can show now. Show in Ukraine. That is why such an extended format of our work is important. Interstate cooperation at the level of presidents and governments - and cooperation at the level of local communities. The leading role of French business. Your non-governmental and professional associations. Today here, at our Forum and at the Conference that took place in the morning, at other events, the full power of French society is represented. And I believe that thanks to the timely investment of your strength in Ukraine, we will achieve equally beneficial results for both Ukraine and France, for ordinary Ukrainians, and for all your citizens. To list everything that was destroyed by Russia in Ukraine, all our needs for reconstruction and modernization, time set in regulations for this meeting of ours won’t be enough for sure. I will focus on several areas now. The first is the Chernihiv region of our country, the region over which France has already taken patronage. We’ve ousted the Russian army from there in the spring already. The hostilities in the Chernihiv region, as well as in other northern regions of Ukraine, lasted less than in the east or the south. But there is also significant destruction there. In general, 8,896 objects need to be restored in the Chernihiv region only in the framework of the Fast Recovery Plan - i.e. the objects that require immediate efforts. These are more than a thousand apartment buildings that were damaged or destroyed by shelling. More than 7 thousand private houses. And also hospitals, schools, communications, transport, enterprises. And this is only one region! Part of the work is already underway. In particular, France has already provided us with assistance in the restoration of bridges. But both for the French state and for French companies, there are much more opportunities and projects that need implementation. Today, Ukrainian government officials will present our needs for the fast recovery. And I invite you all to join! Join now - including in the framework of France's patronage over the Chernihiv region. In total, hostilities directly affected the territory of eleven regions. The scope of our Fast Recovery Plan, which covers other regions as well, is more than fifty thousand objects and more than 12 billion euros. The second direction is charity. In her speech at the Conference in the morning, the First Lady of Ukraine presented a project to restore one of the hospitals of the Kharkiv region of Ukraine, the hub hospital in the city of Izyum. This is one of those projects for which Olena’s Foundation raises funds. Today, the Foundation will be presented in France, thank you for that. All areas of its work will be presented. These are education, healthcare and humanitarian aid. In each of these directions, people, public associations and companies of France can show themselves. And I ask you, Emmanuel, Mr. President, and I ask Mrs. Brigitte Macron to support this Foundation and, if possible, to be present there today. This is now an unconditional moral dominant in our society - everyone strives to do something that will strengthen us all - all of Ukraine. Someone can help the defense. Someone keeps jobs and even creates new ones - during the war. Someone joins the reconstruction. Thousands of people show volunteer initiative, participate in relevant projects. And also there is the social sphere - education, medicine, assistance to the elderly and assistance to displaced people... I invite all of you, friends, to choose your own direction! And the third is the economy. The already mentioned Chernihiv region and all other regions of our country need a new economic basis for life. Of course, all the details will be presented today by our government officials. But I will now draw your attention to something that you have undoubtedly already heard about. This year, due to the joint efforts of Ukraine and our partners, we managed to stop the spread of the global food crisis. We have restored seaborne agricultural exports from Ukraine, which have been blocked by the Russian fleet since the start of the full-scale war. Since August of this year, we have already exported more than 13 million tons of food. We also launched the globally important humanitarian initiative \"Grain from Ukraine\" - and I thank France and President Macron for supporting it. Thanks to this initiative of ours, we will help the poorest countries in the world with food. Such countries as Ethiopia, Yemen, Sudan, and others. This is the salvation of millions of lives from famine and all the countries of the Mediterranean Basin from outbreaks of the migration crisis. But, friends, we send mainly agricultural raw materials both for export and as humanitarian cargo. And we can send processed products. It means that right now we need to develop an entire industry, which will be export-oriented, will definitely have consumers and will definitely be profitable. It is obvious that this is a profitable economic project. And it would be expedient for the French business to already assess the prospects and come to Ukraine for such a project. Likewise, we now have tremendous opportunities in energy, engineering, defense industry, transport, construction, IT and many other industries. Opportunities that you will not find anywhere else in the world now. Only in Ukraine can a large-scale project of ecological and modern re-industrialization be implemented quite quickly, and we have a clear understanding of how to do it. I know that today the representatives of our state will invite specific companies to cooperate and will outline the general prospects - what exactly we can offer to French business and what decisions we need at the level of the French state. Please join in! First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko and representative of the Office of the President Rostyslav Shurma will present specific areas of possible cooperation. The sooner and more effectively we combine the power of Ukraine and France, the more we will benefit from it. And the more reliable peace will be, which, I am sure, we will be able to return to our country and all of Europe. I thank you for your attention! Thank you, Emmanuel. Please be proactive today in your communication with our government officials. Long live France! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a very fruitful day for Ukraine. In different aspects. We have very good news from France - two conferences in support of Ukraine were held there today. Their first result is €1 billion in aid to our resilience, primarily energy. Every day we gain new strength for Ukraine to get through this winter, and I thank everyone who works for this and who helps our state. Today, we also have decisions from other countries, besides France, - the Czech Republic, Spain, Switzerland - to provide additional support packages. The Italian Senate passed a decision on armed support. Norway is preparing a new program to support our state and people... I took part in both conferences in Paris today. The first concerned to a greater extent our interstate relations. The second forum was focused on French business. Ukrainian government officials presented French entrepreneurs with opportunities to invest in Ukraine already now, when the war is still going on, and after our victory. We also discussed what we can do additionally to strengthen our state at the European level. Today in France, the First Lady of Ukraine presents humanitarian projects to our partners. What can be done as quickly as possible to support our people in the field of healthcare, education and humanitarian aid, in particular through Olena’s Foundation. And I am grateful to all the French for their support of Ukraine - not only political, not only defense and sanctions, which is vitally important. But also for the fact that we equally perceive the need to protect the value of human life, human dignity and the humanitarian opportunities that the modern world gives to everyone. I spoke with President of the European Council Charles Michel. I thanked for the decision regarding 18 billion euros for Ukraine next year and for increasing the European Peace Facility by 2 billion euros. These funds can greatly help us maintain social stability. I am also preparing to participate in the meeting of the European Council on December 15. I have just addressed the parliament and people of New Zealand, a country that has fundamentally supported us since the first weeks of full-scale Russian aggression. I’ve told about our peace formula, about the special summit that we are convening to implement our formula. And I called on New Zealand to take the lead in supporting at the international level one of the clauses of the peace formula - the one related to environmental security and demining. New Zealand is one of those countries that understands that the destruction of the natural environment is equal to the destruction of life, and that can help the diplomatic mobilization of its region in order to implement the Ukrainian peace formula. And one more thing. Today I signed the Law adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on the liquidation of the District Administrative Court of Kyiv. This story is over. And the story of reforms continues - continues even during such a war. Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who is fighting for our independence, who is currently at the front, who is currently struggling! We support you, we strongly believe in you. Glory to all our warriors! Glory to our indomitable people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear friends! Mrs. Prime Minister! Mr. Speaker! Mr. leader of the opposition! Government officials and parliamentarians! People of New Zealand! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and I would like to offer you leadership. Leadership in the protection of peace. This year has shown the world how much you can do when you have enough determination and know what to do. And let's be honest - at the beginning of this year, no one in the world expected sensations from Ukraine. When the full-scale invasion of Russia began, I heard only sympathy in the voices of many interlocutors. But when they heard determination in response, everything changed instantly. Everyone whose heart resonated with the Ukrainian struggle for freedom joined the global coalition for the defense of freedom. Today, our anti-war coalition already includes more than a hundred states. Those who support the fundamental principles of international law and the UN Charter. Those who in international institutions - for example in the UN General Assembly - vote for decisions in favor of peace and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Those who provide our state with armed support and train our military. Those who imposed sanctions against the terrorist state and constantly raise the price for Russia for aggression and the global crises provoked by it. And those who help us solve these crises. Those who do everything to hold Russian war criminals to account for what they have committed against Ukraine. In 293 days of this terrible war, the very developments created opportunities for various countries and leaders to show themselves - to find their function in the protection of what all of us in the world value anyway. And I am grateful to you, dear friends, for the fact that New Zealand was one of the first to start supporting Ukraine in the struggle for independence and justice. Having felt the peculiarity of the moral challenge of this war, you changed your own approaches to sanctions policy and applied national sanctions against those involved in inciting aggression. You helped with finances for security needs, with the supply of ammunition and with the training of the military. You provided us with humanitarian support and you always help on international platforms. We in Ukraine appreciate all this very much. I thank you again for this support! But I would like to offer you something more. Various dictators and aggressors always do not realize that the strength of the free world is not that someone is big and accumulated missiles, but that everyone knows how to unite and act decisively, sincerely, and that everyone makes their unique contribution to the common cause. Maybe it is time for your country to make just such a unique contribution. I am talking now about one of the points of our Peace Formula, which I proposed recently at the G19 summit held in Indonesia. So, you have probably heard about 10 points that can restore peace to Ukraine and all of Europe, and restore security and stability to the world, which were shattered by Russian strikes. These are very transparent and logical points. This is radiation and nuclear security. Food security. Energy security. Release of all prisoners of war and return of deportees. Full implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of territorial integrity of Ukraine. Withdrawal of Russian troops from our land and, thanks to this, cessation of hostilities. Restoring justice through the prosecution of war criminals. Countering ecocide. Preventing the escalation of the war and fixing its end. Each of these points is capable of removing one or another element of Russian aggression. And therefore, they all guarantee peace. And I suggested convening a special summit in the coming months. Global Peace Formula Summit, at which the partner states could decide which of the points of the Peace Formula they could help implement. Similar to how we implement the second point of the Formula - food security. There is a format of cooperation with the UN, with Türkiye, with other partners, and as a result, there are two initiatives that remove from the global food market the deficit that arose due to the criminal Russian blockade of our seaports. We unblocked three Ukrainian seaports. The results of this are obvious. Our grain export initiative and Grain From Ukraine humanitarian initiative are now working together to solve the problem of global famine. By the way, please inquire about them. Perhaps you will see your role in mitigating the food crisis as well. But still, first of all, I urge you to pay attention to the eighth point of our Peace Formula. The point on environmental security. Educated people understand well what war means for the natural environment. Your society is just that - educated. The destroyed economy and infrastructure can be rebuilt. It takes years. But you cannot rebuild destroyed nature. Just as you cannot restore destroyed life. As of now, 174,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory are contaminated with mines and unexploded ordnance. The water area of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov is also contaminated with mines and has lost hundreds of thousands of living creatures who died as a result of hostilities and the activity of the Russian navy. Dozens of rivers are polluted. Hundreds of coal mines are flooded. Dozens of the most hazardous enterprises, including chemical ones, were destroyed by Russian strikes. Three million hectares of forests in Ukraine are affected by hostilities. All this and other manifestations of the Russian ecocidal policy will have direct negative repercussions for millions of people, for our region and neighboring regions. I am sure that your society feels the fragility of our world. Feels how important it is for all people on the planet to conduct a rational policy in relation to our common home. By the way, just as in relation to our common values, on which the peaceful coexistence of nations is based. And that is why I suggest that your country, your leaders consider taking into account this environmental point of our Peace Formula. I urge you to show leadership in international institutions, in particular in the UN, and on a bilateral level with other states, so that the world can see this challenge of the Russian war. So that the world sees that there is no real peace where any child can die from a hidden Russian anti-personnel mine. There is no real peace where the consequences of war in the form of poisoned groundwater can destroy normal life in several countries. There is no real peace where ecocide has taken place, and its consequences have not been overcome. Perhaps now it seems that there will be no great sensations from such a topic. But until today, the world does not have a common experience of overcoming the destructive impact of war on the natural environment. We will liberate our land. We will win this war - I am sure of it. We will return freedom and security to all Ukrainians, no matter where they live. The countries of the world are already taking the lead in implementing such points of our Peace Formula, such as, for example, the point on justice. Yesterday, the Netherlands announced its readiness to host a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. And I urge you to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula in your parliament and start the consolidation of the world for the sake of the eighth point of the Formula - for the sake of countering ecocide. Let Russia be held to account for all manifestations of its aggression. I thank you for your attention! Nga mihi! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you Roberta! Dear Mrs. President, dear Roberta! Dear friends! Greetings to you on behalf of all our people, it is a great honor for me. Greetings from all those who fight, who work for the sake of Ukraine and for the sake of freedom. For the sake of everything without which it is impossible to imagine all of us, life, Europe. Impossible to imagine without Ukraine and without freedom. And not only because it will simply be untrue. But also because any attempt to deprive Europe of Ukraine and freedom is always a crime. And we see such a crime now - Russia's terrorist war against Ukraine and Europe. This was also the case in the past, when tyrannies tried to subjugate Ukrainians and deprive all Europeans of their freedom. But when we win now - Ukrainians and all Europeans - we will win in such a way that there will never again be attempts to deprive Europe of Ukraine and freedom. We will win in such a way that there will be no attempt to apply genocidal policy against our people again, both in Ukraine and throughout Europe. We have to give - and we will! – a new effective security architecture for global freedom and international legal order. I consider this part of our common moral obligation. Look at the offensive of the Russian army. The occupiers are burning everything in front of them - with artillery and missiles, bombs and drones, mines, ordnance that did not explode and remains in our land. The occupiers are destroying cities and villages and all vital infrastructure... This was the case in Mariupol - you all saw it. This was the case in Volnovakha, another city that was completely destroyed after the Russian offensive. More than 20 thousand people lived there before this war. Now there are total ruins. The Russian army is doing the same with Bakhmut, another city of Donbas, which Russian strikes turn into broken stones. More than 70,000 people used to live there... Just recently. Last year. Now there are ruins. Perhaps only after the end of this war, when we liberate all our land and can discover all the graves of the victims of Russian terror, will we be able to say how many lives tyranny took this time. Now we know thousands of names of the dead. Unfortunately, there may be many more of them. I ask all of you to honor with a moment of silence the memory of all Ukrainian men, all Ukrainian women, all adults and children, all soldiers, all civilians, whose lives were taken by this disgraceful war! Thank you very much! Dear friends! It is necessary to act now - without waiting for the end of the war - to hold to account all those who started it, and to prevent any repetition of aggression. This will be the most effective protection of freedom, human rights, the rule of law and other common values of ours, which are embodied, in particular, by this award of the European Parliament - the Sakharov Prize. I am grateful to everyone who investigates and helps investigate the crimes of the occupiers in Ukraine, who is looking for information about Russian murderers and terrorists. I am grateful to the International Criminal Court, which closely cooperates with Ukrainian prosecutors and has a clear intention to ensure justice for what the occupiers committed on the territory of our country. And I am grateful to all the leaders and states, all the politicians and international organizations who are working together with us and are making every possible effort to create a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. I call on all of you, your parties and states to effectively support this work! The tribunal must start working. The European Parliament has already supported this idea. It is necessary to turn it into reality as soon as possible. In particular, through the adoption of a separate resolution of the European Parliament in support of the creation of the Tribunal, through your support and the support of your countries for the corresponding resolution of the UN General Assembly. The cities and villages destroyed by Russia, destroyed destinies, broken and executed lives should be reflected in the sentences not only for those who directly committed all this, but also in the sentences for those who organized and started this aggression. And when the principle of the inevitability of punishment works for the crime of aggression against Ukraine, we will be able to make the corresponding institutional basis of justice permanently effective. When any potential aggressor knows that punishment for criminal war is inevitable, it will be the most effective tool for war prevention. And one more thing. Historical responsibility. Evil always has a motive to return when the history of evil is not fully written. Dear deputies! I know that tomorrow you will consider the issue of recognizing the Holodomor crime against the Ukrainian people as genocide. And I urge you to support such a recognition with the maximum majority of votes for the sake of justice. Europe should give the strongest possible signal that there will not be a single gap left in the history of tragedies on our continent, in the history of crimes against humanity and humanness committed on our land. I believe that it will be so! Thank you for your support! Thank you for celebrating our struggle - for this award! I thank you personally, Roberta, for supporting us - you came to Kyiv in a difficult, dangerous time, for supporting our reforms, our movement into European structures, and for really helping. Thank you! Glory to all our warriors! Glory to everyone who defends freedom and our people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! First of all, I want to thank our anti-aircraft gunners and the Air Force for repelling another attack by Iranian drones this morning. The skies of the Kyiv region are defended by the 96th anti-aircraft missile brigade of the Air Force. Thank you guys! A total of 13 Shaheds were shot down. These are 13 saved infrastructure objects, these are saved lives. In one morning. I held a meeting of the Staff today. We talked, in particular, about the protection of the sky. We are constantly strengthening our air defense and anti-drone defense. And we are doing everything to get more modern and more powerful systems for Ukraine. This week we have made important progress on the air defense issue. Of course, the situation in Donbas and other active areas on the frontline was discussed in great detail at the Staff meeting. There is no calm on the frontline. There is nothing easy and simple. Every day and every meter is given extremely hard. Especially where the entire tactic of the occupiers boils down to the destruction of everything in front of them with artillery, so that only bare ruins and craters in the ground remain. Today, by the way, I spoke about it in an address to the European Parliament. Russia is destroying city after city in Donbas, like Mariupol, like Volnovakha, like Bakhmut. Defense in such conditions is not just heroism, it is something more. And I thank all our warriors who withstand the pressure of the occupiers. I would like to note the warriors of the 46th separate airmobile brigade, who very skillfully and bravely defeated the enemy during another attack and forced him to retreat. Well done! I would also like to note the warriors of the 80th and 95th separate airborne assault brigades who are fighting in the Kreminna direction - and very effectively. Thank you, warriors! We are preparing agreements that will strengthen our defense capabilities and give Ukraine more operational capabilities. We also do not slow down our activity for the sake of creating a special tribunal for Russian aggression and holding all those responsible for it to account. Today I called on our friends in Europe and members of the European Parliament to step up their efforts to make the tribunal finally operational. The terrorist state must bear responsibility for every burned Ukrainian city, for every destroyed life of our people. And it will bear it. I spoke today with International Olympic Committee President Bach. In particular, about the fact that the principles of the Olympic movement definitely do not envisage conniving with terrorist states. Any ideas on how to get Russian representatives back to international competitions are ideas on how to allow those guilty of terror to tell their society that the world supposedly condones terror. This is a sports indulgence. This is how it will be presented by Russian propaganda if the International Olympic Committee fails and allows those who represent war and nothing else to participate in sporting events on an equal footing with others. I do not want to clarify whether there are any motives behind such ideas about the return of Russia. But no one will turn a blind eye to any attempt to reduce international pressure on the source of the war. When we receive reports like today from Kherson, where a child, a boy, was killed by yet another Russian shelling... He was eight years old... We can only say one thing: a white or any neutral flag is impossible for Russian athletes, all their flags are bloodstained. Today, I held very important negotiations with UN Secretary-General Guterres. I thanked him for his constant support of Ukraine and international law, for effective assistance in the implementation of our initiatives, such as \"Grain from Ukraine\". We are currently working on organizing missions with an international mandate to the objects of the critical energy infrastructure of our state. I believe that this can also be successful. And one more thing. Today, 64 Ukrainians were returned from Russian captivity. 64 warriors. Four officers and 60 privates and sergeants. Among them are seriously wounded. We provide adequate assistance to everyone. We continue to work to free and return home every Ukrainian man and woman still held captive in Russia. I would like to thank our team that ensures the exchanges. I thank everyone who works for Ukrainians and Ukraine! Glory to all who fight for our country! Glory to all who fill with their courage and effectiveness the word that is now heard all over the world - the word “Ukraine”. And I want to separately thank \"Plast\" today, our Ukrainian scouts, guides for the Peace Light of Bethlehem, which they brought to Ukraine. Let this light support all of us, all Ukrainians. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you very much, Charles! Thank you very much, Mr. President! Dear colleagues! I am glad to greet you all. Next week, December 23, it will be six months since Ukraine obtained the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. And we wasted no time - Ukraine and all of Europe became stronger in six months. We maintain unity - and that is why we find effective answers to any anti-European challenges. We continue to defend our common values together, and therefore together we achieve tangible victories. In six months, we returned the territory of the Kharkiv region to Ukraine and all of Europe, returned the city of Kherson and part of the Kherson region, which were occupied by Russia at the beginning of the invasion. This liberation showed the world that our common defense is not something accidental, but an inalienable and unstoppable force of ours. And I thank you for the large-scale and multifaceted assistance to Ukraine, which allows us to return freedom to our people, our cities, our villages. Nothing else proves the strength of Europe more clearly than the tears of gratitude in the eyes of the people we are liberating from the Russian occupation - in particular, thanks to your support. I thank you very much! During these six months, we started the construction of an air shield for Ukraine, and therefore - the creation of one of the key security guarantees for the whole of Europe. When we have a sufficiently powerful and modern air defense and missile defense system, we will be able to dismantle the basis of Russian terror, namely, we will destroy Russia's ability to destroy others. I am grateful to all our partners who help us with air defense and missile defense, guaranteeing the security of the entire eastern flank of Europe. In six months, we not only preserved the full spectrum of political initiative, but also found a solution to overcome the unprecedented crises provoked by Russia. In particular, we have taken globally useful steps to stop the food crisis and prevent a new migrant crisis, which could hit at least the entire south of our continent. I am grateful to everyone who supported our grain export initiative, who has already joined our humanitarian initiative \"Grain From Ukraine\" and who helps create new logistics and export-import opportunities in all parts of Europe, which strengthen all of us. And right now we see what internal strength Europe has to guarantee energy security and protect itself from the social outbreaks that our common enemy so hoped for. Europe prepared for winter in conditions where Russia artificially created an absolutely insane deficit on the gas market. Now we see that this madness has hit not Europe, but the gas industry of Russia itself. I am grateful to all of you who are helping Ukraine overcome the most cynical form of terror that has ever been on our continent - energy terror. The Russian bet on the destruction of our energy infrastructure, our energy industry, and therefore on a humanitarian catastrophe for tens of millions of Ukrainians and all our neighboring countries in the EU remains. Therefore, we still need your support for energy, and therefore social resilience. Dear colleagues! Europe! The next six months will be decisive in many respects in the confrontation that Russia started with this aggression. Aggression against Ukraine and against each of you, because the ultimate target of Russia is much further than our border and Ukrainian sovereignty. The next six months will demand even greater efforts from us than this past time. First, Russia's energy terror must be defeated in all its forms. Any Russian energy blackmail, any destructive actions by Russia against critical infrastructure in Ukraine or, for example, against underwater cables and gas pipelines in Europe, any attempts to destabilize the gas and oil markets or nuclear energy sector must receive strong responses from all of Europe. From this point of view, the idea of price caps for Russian energy exports is extremely useful. The stronger such an instrument will be, the lower the price caps, the more stable the global energy market will be. And we urge you to agree on effective price caps for oil, oil products, and gas from Russia. These price caps should definitely deprive the terrorist state of the ability to finance the war at the expense of the global market. And the ultimate goal of the entire energy strategy of Europe should be the complete independence of our continent from dirty Russian energy resources. I assure you that, from this perspective, Ukraine will be able to become a new reliable major supplier of green energy resources for the whole of Europe. The second is the winter resilience of Ukraine. Russia wants to break your security by destroying our infrastructure. Any blackouts in Ukraine are strikes at your social systems due to new waves of migration. Any attempts by Russia to show that Ukraine does not have sufficient resilience are attempts to show you, the world, that Europe does not have sufficient resilience. Therefore I urge you to continue doing everything so that we can maintain the energy supply for Ukrainians. And I am grateful to each and every one of you who are already helping with the supply of equipment and financial support. But now, in order for the next six months to pass without upheavals, something more needs to be done. In particular, we need support in the purchase of the volume of gas that is used to compensate for the damage caused by Russian strikes at other types of generation. It is about two billion cubic meters of gas. We also need support with electricity for Ukraine - with supply from the EU. Just as we can help you by exporting electricity when we get our generation back up, we need your help now to get us through this winter. It is about the supply of electricity worth about eight hundred million euros. The third aspect is defensive support. It should be no less than in the past six months. This is critically important for the protection of Ukrainian freedom and the very idea of Europe in the global confrontation with Russia. But apart from this, we need more modern weapons, more supply. This applies to both air defense and missile defense. And I ask each of the twenty-seven countries of the European Union to decide what specifically you can do to increase the supply of air defense and missile defense systems. This also applies to modern tanks. There is no rational reason why Ukraine should not receive them now. I am asking you to show leadership - the first one to provide modern tanks will open this supply possibility to the whole world and will be remembered as one of the most important defenders of freedom in our time. This also applies to longer-range artillery and missile systems that could speed up the end of Russian aggression. All this is a direct saving of millions of lives. The fourth is diplomacy. Over the past six months, we have developed and offered to the world a Peace Formula that contains everything necessary not only to end this war, but also to guarantee, reliably and permanently, that there will be no repetition of the same or the beginning of any other war in Europe. I urge you to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula! You all know its elements - they are logical, effective, and can be implemented already in the next six months. For this purpose, in the near future we are organizing a summit - Global Peace Formula Summit. I hope to see all of you and your leadership in helping peace at this summit. Pay attention - each of the points of our Peace Formula allows each conscientious country to show its leadership and help with this or that specific goal. In fact, it is like a menu - for manifestations of leadership. And these are really opportunities for all countries to contribute to the security of Ukraine, the whole of Europe, and the world. These are opportunities both for those who are more active in international relations and for those who, so far, do less to protect peace. And the fifth - for the next six months. A task based on values. I want to thank all of you once again for supporting Ukraine in obtaining the candidate status. Now is the time to take another step. Despite the war, we do not stop the institutional transformation of our state. This week alone, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved three European integration laws: the law on national communities, the law on modernization of the principles of work of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and on the media sphere. And this is just one illustration of the many things we have done in order to prepare the next stage of rapprochement between Ukraine and the EU. Namely, the assessment of the implementation of the recommendations of the European Commission, which we expect from you in the near future. And we strongly ask you to do this, and to speed up this process, so that we can proceed to the start of negotiations regarding Ukraine's membership in the EU. I believe that everything emphasized by me today will be implemented. Because for Ukraine and for Europe, when we are together, nothing is impossible. We will defeat any terror, we will implement any of our joint tasks. I thank you for your attention! And I thank you for the support! I would like to express special gratitude for your steps on sanctions over the past six months, for the package of financial support for our country in the amount of 18 billion euros for the next year, which can be finally approved at the leadership level right now. This is vital. And Charles, my friend, I am asking you very much to ensure that our struggle for peace for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe does not depend on misunderstandings and controversies between some EU member states. The packages of macro-financial support for Ukraine are also weapons in defense of freedom. Just as the ninth package of EU sanctions against Russia. This is our protection. Please understand that! I hope that already in January we will be able to thank you for the first tranche of this macro-financial package. Thanks again for your attention! Long live Europe! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Briefly about today. First. There is a confirmation of the macro-financial aid from the European Union for Ukraine for the next year. The volume is 18 billion euros. This is a good result. Second. I spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau. It was a good conversation - we are preparing to strengthen our defense cooperation. I am grateful to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and all Canadians for the principled leadership on sanctions policy. Every sanction step against Russia for the war that has already been taken by the free world really helps us bring peace closer. Third. We are preparing important international events for the next week. Something that could give Ukraine more defense support this winter, more military capabilities. During another Russian shelling of Kherson today, a projectile hit the aid station of the Red Cross. The woman who died was a paramedic, a volunteer. My condolences to the relatives... Just since the beginning of this day, Russia has shelled Kherson more than 16 times! Only in one day! And it is so every day. Today, communities of the Kharkiv region were shelled again... Today in Donbas, as in all previous weeks, brutal Russian attacks continue. The occupiers throw everyone and everything they have into the offensive. They cannot defeat our army, so they physically destroy every town and village so that there are no buildings, not even walls, that can be used for any kind of defense... The only way to stop this is to push out Russian terrorists step by step from our Ukrainian land. To continue the pressure on Russia. To find new ways to hold every Russian terrorist, every Russian oligarch who helps the terrorist state and all Russian officials and propagandists to account for everything they do. Do against Ukraine, against freedom as such. Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who holds the front in Donbas, in the south, who holds the border, who protects our sky and our people. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! First of all, I thank our Air Force fighters, our counter aircraft fighters, intelligence and everyone who protects and helps protect the Ukrainian sky. Today's result is 60 shot down missiles. All air commands – Center, South, East and West were active. And the fighters of the 96th anti-aircraft missile brigade, which protect Kyiv region, were especially effective. Over 40 terrorists' missiles were destroyed in the sky of the central regions of the country and near Kyiv. I thank you, warriors! But, unfortunately, there is a hit. Terrorists need such a large number of missiles in an attack that at least part of their \"products\" reaches their intended targets. All their targets today are civilian, and these are mainly energy and heat supply facilities. Probably, as a result of this war, the meaning of the word \"terror\" for most people in the world will be associated primarily with such crazy actions of Russia. In Kryvy Rih, the demolition of the rubble of a residential building, which was hit by one of the Russian missiles, continued all day. The list of the dead so far includes three. My condolences to all the relatives... More than ten people were injured, including children. Everyone gets help. Emergency power outages were applied today across the country – in most cities and regions. In Kyiv and 14 regions, as a result of power outages, water supply halted. Our power engineers and repair crews have already started working during the air alert and are doing everything possible to restore generation and supply. It takes time. But it will be. I ask all our people to be patient now and I thank everyone whose job is to restore normality at any time and under any circumstances. I also ask the representatives of regional and local authorities to be more active in creating an additional reserve of energy strength. Please work more actively with business so that more companies join the Points of Invincibility map. And I ask everyone now – of course, if possible – to take care of those who have the most difficulties... The elderly, families with children, displaced people from war zones or from the occupied territory. If you can help, please help. No matter what the missile worshipers from Moscow are hoping for, it still won't change the balance of power in this war. They still have enough missiles for several such heavy strikes. We have enough determination and self-belief to return our own after these blows. And one more. The European Union approved the ninth package of sanctions against Russia during the war. Ninth, but obviously not the last. Because it is obvious that the pressure needs to be increased. I thank all those leaders and countries who fought for a stronger package. But we will work with the European Commission, with the leaders of the EU countries, with the European public, so that the existing sanctions policy works towards the end of the war and does not give Russia wrong signals – signals that someone is ready to ease the pressure. I thank everyone who keeps to principles! Glory to all who work for our victory! Glory to all our soldiers, who heroically repel all attempts of Russian mercenaries to gain a foothold in Bakhmut! 17th separate tank brigade, 46th separate airmobile brigade – glory to you guys! Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Air Force – Thanks again! And the last. I will repeat constantly. Dear our partners, find an opportunity to provide us with a reliable air defense shield. This is saving people's lives. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health! The main thing today is energy. During the day, it was possible to restore the electricity supply to almost 6 million Ukrainians. Repair work is ongoing now and has been going on non-stop since yesterday's terrorist attack. Of course, there is still a lot of work to do to stabilize the system. Problems with the supply of heat, big problems with the supply of water exist. The most difficult situation is in the city of Kyiv and the region, Vinnytsia and the region, Lviv and the region. But there are, unfortunately, large-scale outages in many other regions: they include Dnipro and Dnipropetrovsk region, Volyn, Zhytomyr region, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk region, the city of Odesa and the region, Poltava region, Ternopil region, Chernihiv region and other cities and regions. Russia spares no resources for the war against our people – precisely against the people, against all Ukrainians from Lutsk to Kharkiv, from Sumy to Odesa. And I am grateful to every leader, I am grateful to every nation – our partners who understand that Russia's large-scale \"investment\" in terror is already, imagine, more than 4,000 missiles! It's necessary to exceed it with even more help to the people against whom this terror is directed. This week we received important decisions from the EU, partner countries in Europe, the United States, which will help maintain stability now and in the coming year. This applies to defense support, energy support, and macro-financial assistance for Ukraine. But there is still work to be done. There are still vital decisions awaiting final approval and implementation. In particular, I will constantly remind... Dear partners! Find an opportunity to give Ukraine reliable protection of the sky, a reliable air defense shield. You can do it. You can give protection to our people – one hundred percent protection from these terrorist Russian strikes. When this happens, the main form of Russian terror – missile terror – will become simply impossible. And this will mean safety for Ukrainians, safety for millions of people and a strategic realignment of the entire military situation. The fewer opportunities Russia has for terror, the more opportunities we will have to restore and guarantee peace. We are already preparing for the international events that are planned for the near future – both political and more global, which include not only traditional political audiences, but also all people of the world who value peace and are ready to support our defense against Russian terror. You will see everything. Also on Monday, a meeting of the leaders of the Northern European countries will take place: the UK, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Iceland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway. These are our extremely important friends, important partners and effective helpers in our defense. So we are preparing several new proposals from Ukraine, how to strengthen us all, all the countries of Europe. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! Thank you to all our energy workers, everyone who works to supply heat and water, everyone who repairs communications damaged by shelling and restores, and restores, and restores normal life every time, no matter how the terrorists try to leave us in the cold and in the dark. The terrorists will still lose. Glory to all those who hold back hell in Bakhmut and other areas in Donetsk region! Glory to all who hold our front! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I held a meeting of the Staff today. The situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions was examined in great detail. The Bakhmut direction is key. We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there. The Zaporizhzhia region, the Kherson region, the south in general - we are gradually reducing the potential of the occupiers. Minus ammunition dumps, minus logistics of the Russian army. Air defense is a constant priority of the Staff, and I emphasize this once again... Dear partners! By helping us fully protect our skies, by providing us with more modern air defense systems in sufficient numbers, you can deprive the terrorist state of its main instrument of terror. This will be one of the most powerful steps that will bring the end of aggression closer. Russia will have to follow the path of cessation of aggression, when it can no longer follow the path of missile strikes. The border was also discussed in detail at the Staff. Protection of the border with both Russia and Belarus is also a constant priority. We are preparing for all possible defense scenarios. Whoever inclines Minsk to whatever, it will not help them just as any other sick idea in this war against Ukraine and Ukrainians. There are new results in returning light and heat to our people. Another 3 million Ukrainians have had their energy supply restored. Plus 6 million yesterday. That is, after the terrorist attack on Friday, there is already a result for 9 million of our people. In most cities, the work of transport is being normalized. I thank everyone who carries out these repair works in any weather and around the clock! I thank each of our partners who help us with equipment! I also thank Ukrainian business - everyone who transforms their shops, cafes, enterprises into new Points of Invincibility. Today, the FIFA World Cup final took place in Qatar - an emotional final. This is the meaning of football: everyone has a chance to win, everyone can show that he is the strongest. But the competition is on the playing field, not on the battlefield. And the worst thing that can happen is a red card, not a red button. When people are united by football, people are united by peace. That is why I have prepared a special address from Ukraine to the whole world for today. To all who value peace and life. Although FIFA blocked this address from being shown at the stadium before the final game in Qatar, the world still heard our call. Our football players shared the video... Yarmolenko and the entire national team of Ukraine, Shevchenko, Shovkovskyi, Modrić, Srna, Guardiola, Raț and many, many other wonderful players. I thank everyone! Partner states supported it. Thousands of world media spread it. We are already preparing a special summit this winter. A summit for peace. For our country and for any other nation that can be subjected to the same aggression, the same terror as Russia has brought to our land. The Ukrainian Peace Formula consists of ten clear points capable of creating a new, globally important security architecture, which will restore freedom to our entire Ukrainian land, to all our people. And which will serve as guarantees of freedom and security for other nations. Not if, but when it works for Ukrainians. And that is why we invite our partners to show their leadership in guaranteeing peace in the same way that the leadership of various countries and various statesmen is currently being shown in the defense of freedom. We fight together for Ukraine, for the values that unite Europe and the democratic world, for the global value of life. For everything that Russia is trying to destroy. It is not easy, it is difficult, but I am sure: we will pull through together, and Russia's aggression will fail. And in a way so that all other potential aggressors of the world do not dare to repeat what russism does. Glory to each of our warriors! Gratitude to everyone who works for the victory and who helps! We will pull through everything, we will overcome everything. And one more thing. Congratulations to the Jewish community of Ukraine and all the Jews of the world on Hanukkah. Those who were outnumbered defeated those who outnumbered them. Light defeated darkness. It will be the same this time. Chag Hanukkah Sameach! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you very much, Rishi, Mr. Prime Minister Sunak! Mr. Prime Minister Kariņš, everyone present! I am grateful, first of all, for these words of support. They are very important, and they are about the priorities you’ve mentioned. Dear friends, dear leaders! First of all, I want to thank you all for supporting Ukraine and our struggle for freedom. When I participated in this format of ours last time, and it was on the twentieth day of a full-scale invasion, I called on you: help Ukraine and through it - help yourself. This is exactly how we have been acting all these months. And I thank you all for that, for your great support! That is why we see the most important thing - that Russian aggression can and must fail. And our task now is to speed it up. Now - at this summit - I urge you to do everything to speed up the defeat of the occupiers. I will be very specific today - absolutely practical. Perhaps you expect a more political speech. But it is a different time now. It is time for specific things. Ukraine was again attacked by Iranian drones this night. 34 \"Shaheds\". I say both the number and the name, and quite specifically. These are \"Shaheds\" from the new batch that Russia received from Iran. 250 items - that's how many \"Shaheds\" have now been received by the terrorist state. Russian missiles and Iranian drones are constantly used to strike primarily at our energy sector - and you know all the details about it. Only one recent massive attack on Ukraine affected more than 20 million of our people. As a result, cities with millions of inhabitants and most Ukrainian regions were left completely without electricity. In general, on the evening of December 16, 22 million 408 thousand Ukrainians were disconnected from the energy supply. More than 10 million people had their water and heat supplies cut off. Imagine the scale of this terror. And imagine that it can be stopped. Dear leaders! Right now to a large extent it depends on you when and how this war will end. And everything is very specific. The more successful our Defense Forces are, the sooner Russian aggression will fail. Winter is now a really crucial time. It is a time when decisions can be made, the results of which in the spring will allow us to outline the restoration of our territorial integrity and guarantee that Russian revanchism will never again cross the border of Ukraine, and therefore - the border of Europe. And I want to address everyone. Mr. Prime Minister of Britain! Rishi! When we can fully protect the Ukrainian sky, it will mean the dismantling of the last great Russian opportunity to terrorize Ukraine. And therefore, it will also be the dismantling of the last great Russian hope that they will allegedly succeed in conquering our state and people. And I am asking you to increase the possibility of supplying air defense systems to our state and help speed up the relevant decisions of partners. One hundred percent air shield for Ukraine will be one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression. And this step is needed right now. Mr. Prime Minister of Norway! Mr. Støre! I am asking you to continue your policy of defense support for Ukraine in the next year as well - at least at the same level as this year. And we already see tangible results. NASAMS which have already been given to us, significantly strengthened our defense. I thank you for this! I am asking you to increase the supply of such systems and missiles for them. Mrs. Minister of Defense of the Netherlands! Mrs. Ollongren! For our defense operations to be more successful, we need modern armored vehicles. First of all, tanks. There is no explanation why Ukraine has not yet obtained a decision on the provision of modern and effective tanks - in particular, \"Leopards\". This is vital! I am asking you and your partners to reach this decision, to help us. The first to open this defense opportunity for Ukraine - with the supply of tanks - will open it for all other partners of ours. The first step is needed to get others to take their steps as well. I am asking to continue our cooperation regarding Soviet-type tanks - the necessary shells, as well as Harpoon complexes and other artillery systems. Mr. Prime Minister of Sweden! Mr. Kristersson! We have already discussed with you the possibilities of strengthening our artillery. This is what determines the developments on the battlefield, namely the artillery. You know how large a stockpile of artillery systems and shells there is in Russia. And this artillery arrogance of the terrorist state must be shut down. We need to increase our capabilities on the battlefield so that the Russian leadership quicklier understands that this aggression has no chance. You have good Archer systems - I urge you to make a decision on them. And also you can strengthen the capabilities in the defense of the sky, and if you can - these are RBS-98 anti-aircraft missile systems and these are Gripen aircraft. We have to achieve such a historically important result for us. Mr. President of Lithuania! Gіtanas, my friend! I thank you for the fact that Lithuania became one of the first countries to help us. Even before the start of the full-scale invasion, when we have already been preparing for defense, you helped us. I thank you for that! And I am asking you to continue our cooperation next year. We need both NASAMS, as you know, and \"Stingers\", which we can get if your decision is made. Dear Mr. Prime Minister of Latvia! Mr. Kariņš! I thank you for your constant and principled support throughout the Russian war. And let's reduce the time of this aggression even more actively! You can help us with artillery systems - please make such decisions. Dear Mrs. Prime Minister of Estonia! Mrs. Kallas! You also have this opportunity - 155-mm artillery shells, spare parts for howitzers. Let's intensify our cooperation. Dear Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defense of Denmark! Mr. Ellemann-Jensen! You are aware of our need for CAESAR systems, which have proven themselves well on the battlefield, and these are the systems you expect from France. But they are vitally necessary for us right now, precisely in Ukraine. We need your decision on CAESAR. And I am asking you to continue our cooperation next year, which has already been achieved in the field of defense, in particular in anti-ship defense. Dear Mr. President of Finland! Mr. Niinistö! I thank you for the armored vehicles provided to us - the APCs that you provided help us a lot. You have 122-mm and 152-mm caliber - they are vitally necessary. Means of radio-electronic warfare, countering drones. MLRS complexes. Please maintain the level of interaction that has already been achieved between us. The sooner we restore our border, the stronger your security will be. I am sure of it. Dear Mrs. Prime Minister! Mrs. Jakobsdóttir! I thank you for your demining initiatives and humanitarian leadership. I am asking you to expand our cooperation next year, to create even more opportunities to protect our people from Russian mine terror. Dear friends! Today - on St. Nicholas Day according to the Eastern Rite - Russian terrorists \"gifted\" new strikes to Ukrainian children. I am asking you to support our country right now with a clear decision - to provide everything that can not only preserve the existing dynamics on the battlefield in Ukraine, but also accelerate the movement of our Defense Forces to victory. Because our victory will be the victory of each of you, it is the victory of Europe, your nations, the victory, which the whole world expects, I am sure of that. That’s that - Ukrainian children in their letters to St. Nicholas ask for air defense, weapons and victory - victory for themselves, victory for all Ukrainians. Our children understand everything. Let's act! I thank you for your attention! I thank you all for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today's morning in several regions and cities of our country was, unfortunately, spoiled by the characteristic sound of the Iranian Shaheds. But most of them luckily fell short of their intended targets, and that made our morning a little better today. 30 Shaheds were shot down - not bad I thank all our anti-aircraft fighters, pilots, and mobile fire groups for this result and for the protection of the Ukrainian sky. And I am especially grateful to the 96th Kyiv and 208th Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades, which showed the greatest accuracy today. These Shaheds, which were used by Russia, are from a new batch of drones. This is the terrorist international of two regimes - they help fight against people. Well, both of them will be held to account for it. This week will be quite active for us in terms of international events and negotiations. I held several meetings today regarding these plans. We will fight to strengthen sanctions for all manifestations of terror against Ukrainians and to get additional support for our state and our defense forces. Today I addressed the leaders of the ten states of Northern Europe united in The Joint Expeditionary Force. This is a format of cooperation initiated by Great Britain. It includes the Baltic states, Finland, Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, Iceland and the United Kingdom itself. And my appeal today was very specific. Weapons, ammunition, new defense capabilities... Everything that will allow us to speed up the end of this war. Thank you to the participants of the summit for the fact that we were heard today - we are waiting for new decisions regarding the supply of new weapons. The key task for all of us now – my task, and that of each of our diplomats and officials – is that world support for Ukraine next year not just remains at the same level as this year, but increases. Precisely under those indicators that are necessary to strengthen our defense operations. This is artillery - we need more guns, shells, these are modern tanks that have not yet been delivered to Ukraine, these are longer-range MLRS, modern and truly effective air defense... Please, if your opinion is heard in the media, if you support the state in the expert field, you too can help get everything that our defense forces need. The main thing is to speak for Ukraine with one voice and defend our common interest: everything for the victory of Ukraine, everything to help our defense. Bakhmut is the hottest spot on the entire frontline - more than 1300 km of active hostilities. Since May, the occupiers have been trying to break our Bakhmut, but time goes by and Bakhmut is already breaking not only the Russian army, but also the Russian mercenaries who came to replace the wasted army of the occupiers. Just think about it: Russia has already lost almost 99 thousand of its soldiers in Ukraine. Soon there will be 100 thousand of the occupiers’ casualties. For what? No one in Moscow can answer this question. And they won't. They wage war and waste people's lives, other people's lives, not of their loved ones, not their own lives, but the lives of others only because a group in the Kremlin can’t admit mistakes and is terribly afraid of reality. But reality speaks for itself. I thank all our fighters who are heroically holding the Bakhmut direction, Soledar, Avdiivka, Maryinka, Kreminna direction and the entire Donbas region, which was one of the strongest in Ukraine before Russia came, and which Russia is destroying to the scorched ground. Even such cruelty won’t give the enemy anything. Today more consumers than yesterday are disconnected from electricity. Due to several drone hits in the morning. But repairmen, as always, work very actively, around the clock. They are trying to restore power supply as soon as possible, at least at the level that generation can provide. It will be done. And one more thing, which is especially important. Today is Saint Nicholas Day - a traditional day when we all wish peace and warmth, reliable protection and victory. I believe that Nicholas will hear us. Today - just on Saint Nicholas Day  - the project by Ukrzaliznytsia and UNICEF started - a joint project that can bring a holiday to Ukrainian children. To those who live near the frontline and in the de-occupied areas. Special festive trains in three directions. Today - Donetsk region. On December 21, such a festive train leaves for the Kharkiv region. On the 23rd – Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. They bring festive performances and more than 30 thousand gifts. Thank you to everyone at Ukrzaliznytsia, UNICEF and the government who organized this project. I would also like to thank UNICEF separately for more than 100 million dollars of support for Ukrainian families. More than 120,000 families, in particular those raising four or more children, children with disabilities, can receive financial assistance. In total, the program will cover more than 600,000 Ukrainians. Thank you for such support! Thank you to all those who help our people in this terrible time! Thank you to everyone who protects Ukrainians! And I want to turn now to all our friends and just conscientious people in Georgia. Probably, everyone could see the health condition of Mikheil Saakashvili now. Therefore, I appeal to the people of Georgia, to the authorities of Georgia - it is necessary to show mercy, especially on the eve of Christmas. What is happening to Mykhailo now is cruelty. This does not suit Georgia. This must be stopped. Please make a decision that can save his life. Transfer Mikheil Saakashvili to one of the clinics of Ukraine, another European country, America. It is high time to take this good step. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I’ve returned from the Donetsk region, from our Bakhmut fortress. I was there today to support our fighters, to present state awards, to express gratitude to them. To all our heroes - those who defend not only Bakhmut there, and not only our Donbas, but also the whole of Ukraine. We all should understand this. You know, on the way to the frontline, today I also passed through Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka, Kostiantynivka... Cities, villages near them, which are now literally fighting for life. Life for all of us - for all Ukrainians and for everything Ukrainian, and even more so - for everything and everyone who preserves humanity inside. Look at Russia's offensive, what it leaves where it takes its flag. Burned earth, destroyed life... Pain, ruins and graves - this is the so-called \"Russian world\". This is what our heroes stop. This is exactly what they are expelling from Ukraine, step by step returning life to our land, where the occupiers set foot. And for this movement to exist, for our border to exist, for us to return the Ukrainian flag to the cities and villages in the south and east of our state, there is Bakhmut, there is a fortress, there are our heroic defenders. Every day they endured there, every hit they withstood there, every attack they repelled and every counterattack they carried out is a life for Ukraine. I thank all our warriors who defend the #bakhmutfortress! I am grateful to all mothers and fathers, wives and children of our heroes who are saving Ukraine right there! And I am asking all our people: wherever you are, please support the Ukrainian heroes who are holding out against the fiercest attacks of the occupiers, against the most insane Russian strikes... Support our Bakhmut - tattered yet unconquered - and his defenders. We will do everything possible and impossible, expected and unexpected, so that our heroes have everything they need to prevail. To get the results that all Ukrainians expect. That all our cities and villages on the frontline are waiting for. This is Maryinka, this is Vuhledar, this is Toretsk, this is Soledar, Klishchiivka... This is our Luhansk region, this is our south of Ukraine, this is our Crimea. Ukraine will leave nothing of its own to the enemy. This week is extremely important for Ukraine - in order to get through this winter and next year. In order to gain the necessary support and for the Ukrainian flag to finally prevail on all sections of our border - the border of Ukraine. Our fighters gave me our flag today and asked to pass it on to those whose decisions are very important for Ukraine, for all our warriors. We will definitely do it. We will definitely endure. We will definitely get the necessary support for Ukraine! Glory to all the guards of the Bakhmut fortress! Glory to all who fight for our country! Glory to our indomitable and beautiful people! And eternal memory and honor to all Ukrainians whose lives were taken by this cruel war! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Americans! In all states, cities and communities. All those who value freedom and justice. Who cherish it as strongly, as we, Ukrainians, in all our cities, in each and every family. I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart! Madam Vice President, I thank you for your efforts in helping Ukraine! Madam Speaker, you bravely visited Ukraine during the full-fledged war, thank you very much! It is a great honor, a great privilege to be here! Dear members of the Congress – representatives of both parties – who also visited Kyiv! Esteemed Congressmen and Senators – from both parties – who will visit Ukraine, I’m sure, in the future! Dear representatives of diaspora – present in this chamber and spread across the country! Dear journalists! It's a great honor for me to be at the U.S. Congress and speak to you and all Americans! Against all odds and doom and gloom scenarios, Ukraine did not fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking. And it gives me good reason to share with you our first joint victory – we defeated Russia in the battle for minds of the world. We have no fear. Nor should anyone in the world have it. Ukrainians gained this victory – and it gives us courage, which inspires the entire world. Americans gained this victory – and that's why you have succeeded in uniting the global community to protect freedom and international law. Europeans gained this victory – and that's why Europe is now stronger and more independent than ever. The Russian tyranny has lost control over us and it will never influence our minds again. Yet, we have to do whatever it takes to ensure that countries of the Global South also gain such victory. I know one more thing – the Russians will stand a chance to be free only when they defeat the Kremlin in their minds. Yet, the battle continues! And we have to defeat the Kremlin on the battlefield. This battle is not only for the territory – for this or another part of Europe. This battle is not only for life, freedom and security of Ukrainians or any other nation, which Russia attempts to conquer. This struggle will define – in what world our children and grandchildren will live and then – their children and grandchildren. It will define whether it will be a democracy – for Ukrainians and for Americans – for all. This battle cannot be frozen or postponed. It cannot be ignored hoping that the ocean or something else will provide a protection. From the United States to China, from Europe to Latin America, and from Africa to Australia – the world is too interconnected and interdependent to allow someone to stay aside – and at the same time – to feel safe when such a battle continues. Our two nations are Allies in this battle. And next year will be a turning point. The point, when Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom. The freedom of people, who stand for their values. Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! Yesterday – before coming here to Washington DC – I was at the frontline, in our Bakhmut. In our stronghold in the East of Ukraine – in the Donbas. The Russian military and mercenaries have been attacking Bakhmut non-stop since May. They have been attacking it day and night. But Bakhmut stands. Last year seventy thousand people lived there in Bakhmut and now only few civilians stay. Every inch of that land is soaked in blood. Roaring guns sound every hour. Trenches in the Donbas change hands several times a day in fierce combat and even hand fighting. But the Ukrainian Donbas stands. Russians use everything they have against Bakhmut and our other beautiful cities. The occupiers have a significant advantage in artillery. They have an advantage in ammunition. They have much more missiles and planes than we ever had. But our Defense Forces stand. And we all are proud of them. The Russian tactic is primitive. They burn down and destroy everything they see. They sent thugs to the frontlines. They sent convicts to the war... They threw everything against us – similar to the other tyranny, which in the Battle of the Bulge threw everything it had against the free world. Just like the brave American soldiers, which held their lines and fought back Hitler’s forces during the Christmas of 1944, brave Ukrainian soldiers are doing the same to Putin’s forces this Christmas. Ukraine holds its lines and will never surrender! So, here is the frontline – the tyranny, which has no lack of cruelty – against the lives of free people. And your support is crucial – not just to stand in such fights, but to get to the turning point. To win on the battlefield. We have artillery. Yes. Thank you. Is it enough? Honestly, not really. To ensure Bakhmut is not just a stronghold that holds back the Russian army – but for the Russian army to completely pull out – more cannons and shells are needed. If so, just like the battle of Saratoga, the fight for Bakhmut will change the trajectory of our war for independence and freedom. If your «Patriots» stop the Russian terror against our cities, it will let Ukrainian patriots work to the full to defend our freedom. When Russia cannot reach our cities by its artillery, it tries to destroy them with missile attacks. More than that, Russia found an Ally in its genocidal policy – Iran. Iranian deadly drones, sent to Russia in hundreds, became a threat to our critical infrastructure. That is how one terrorist has found the other. It is just a matter of time – when they will strike against your other allies, if we do not stop them now. We must do it! I believe there should be no taboos between us in our alliance. Ukraine never asked the American soldiers to fight on our land instead of us. I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves. Financial assistance is also critically important. And I would like to thank you for both, financial packages you have already provided us with, and the ones you may be willing to decide on. Your money is not charity. It's an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way. Russia could stop its aggression if it wanted to, but you can speed up our victory. I know it. And it will prove to any potential aggressor that no one can succeed in breaking national borders, committing atrocities and reigning over people against their will. It would be naive to wait for steps towards peace from Russia – which enjoys being a terrorist state. Russians are still poisoned by the Kremlin. The restoration of international legal order is our joint task. We need peace. Ukraine has already offered proposals, which I just discussed with President Biden – our Peace Formula. Ten points, which should and must be implemented for our joint security – guaranteed for decades ahead. And the Summit, which can be held. I am glad to stress that President Biden supported our peace initiative today. Each of you, ladies and gentlemen, can assist in its implementation – to ensure that America’s leadership remains solid, bicameral and bipartisan. You can strengthen sanctions to make Russia feel how ruinous its aggression truly is. It is in your power to help us bring to justice everyone, who started this unprovoked and criminal war. Let's do it! Let the terrorist state be held responsible for its terror and aggression, and compensate all losses done by this war. Let the world see that the United States is here! Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! In two days, we will celebrate Christmas. Maybe, candlelit. Not because it is more romantic. But because there will be no electricity. Millions won't have neither heating nor running water. All of this will be the result of Russian missile and drone attacks on our energy infrastructure. But we do not complain. We do not judge and compare whose life is easier. Your well-being is the product of your national security – the result of your struggle for independence and your many victories. We, Ukrainians, will also go through our war of independence and freedom with dignity and success. We'll celebrate Christmas – and even if there is no electricity, the light of our faith in ourselves will not be put out. If Russian missiles attack us – we'll do our best to protect ourselves. If they attack us with Iranian drones and our people will have to go to bomb shelters on Christmas eve – Ukrainians will still sit down at a holiday table and cheer up each other. And we don't have to know everyone's wish as we know that all of us, millions of Ukrainians, wish the same – victory. Only victory. We already built strong Ukraine – with strong people, strong army, and strong institutions. Together with you! We develop strong security guarantees for our country and for entire Europe and the world. Together with you! And also – together with you! – we’ll put in place everyone, who will defy freedom. This will be the basis to protect democracy in Europe and the world over. Now, on this special Christmas time, I want to thank you. All of you. I thank every American family, which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to other people. I thank President Biden and both parties at the Senate and the House – for your invaluable assistance. I thank your cities and your citizens, who supported Ukraine this year, who hosted our people, who waved our national flags, who acted to help us. Thank you all! From everyone, who is now at the frontline. From everyone, who is awaiting victory. Standing here today, I recall the words of the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which are so good for this moment: \"The American People in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory\". The Ukrainian People will win, too. Absolutely. I know that everything depends on us. On Ukrainian Armed Forces! Yet, so much depends on the world! So much in the world depends on you! When I was in Bakhmut yesterday, our heroes gave me the flag. The battle flag. The flag of those who defend Ukraine, Europe and the world at the cost of their lives. They asked me to bring this flag to the US Congress – to members of the House of Representatives and Senators, whose decisions can save millions of people. So, let these decisions be taken! Let this flag stay with you, ladies and gentlemen! This flag is a symbol of our victory in this war! We stand, we fight and we will win. Because we are united. Ukraine, America and the entire free world. May God protect our brave troops and citizens! May God forever bless the United States of America! Merry Christmas and a happy victorious new year!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today will be a very short address and in unusual conditions, but as always - about what we have achieved. We are returning from Washington - we are coming with good results. With something that will really help. When we say \"patriots\" in Ukraine and in the United States, we equally mean the protection of the state and people. This issue has been settled for Ukraine. There is financial support too. Also there are other agreements - more on that later. I thank President Biden for his help, his international leadership, and his determination to win. I am grateful to the Congress of the United States - both houses, both parties, all those who support Ukraine, all those who want victory as much as we all do. There will be victory! Glory to each of our warriors! Glory to everyone who defends our state! We are bringing to Ukraine, to Donbas, to Bakhmut and to the south the decisions that our Defense Forces have been waiting for. On the way home, I met with President of Poland Andrzej Duda. I thanked him, all Poles, the city - rescuer Rzeszów for everything they do for Ukraine and our protection - the protection of Europe. Today, in a special format, face to face, we discussed our interaction with Andrzej. I told him about what I heard in the United States, about our strategic vision for the next year... We are preparing, strengthening our joint forces. And one more thing - today is a professional holiday of people who give us normality, modernity and exactly the level of well-being that the terrorist state wants to destroy. Today is the Day of Energy Workers. I congratulate all of you, defenders of the Ukrainian light, and thank you for your work. We also bring new agreements to help you! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "We are already used to it. This means that everything is fine. If there are sirens, it means that Russia does not forget about us and is afraid of us. We will defeat everyone. Dmytro Ivanovych! Dear Mr. Minister! Dear attendees! Dear heads of diplomatic missions of our country! 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, we all have to be with Ukraine. We have no right to a weekend, no right to rest, no right to vacation, no right to an eight-hour work day. All the rights guaranteed by the Constitution of Ukraine are currently on hold for us personally as representatives of our state. Because if we rest or take it lightly, if we are careless, we will have neither the Constitution of Ukraine nor our state. We must sleep less than the enemy, think more than the enemy, take risks more effectively than the enemy, and communicate with the world better, constantly, on a different level than anyone else in this world. Such an attitude should define your work. We must do everything possible and impossible, formally and informally, personally and directing the forces of the powerful, professional teams we have formed in order to strengthen the defense of our state, guarantee the safety of our people and accelerate the victory of Ukraine. Actually, these are the criteria by which I evaluate and will evaluate the effectiveness of each and every one of you, your work. We do not have time to, for example, watch the two-hour press conferences of the President of the Russian Federation. We simply do not have time for such trifles. We already know how this war will end, and therefore every hour of yours is very important, it should add up the strength of Ukraine and accelerate our victory. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine needs concrete results from each and every one of you. The results that will allow everyone who fights and works for our people, for the sake of Ukraine, to say that you stand by them, even though you are in other countries of the world. And for that to happen, you must understand how bravely and selflessly our people fight, how much they do so that the state can survive, and how much they sacrifice to preserve our free and independent life. No matter where you live and work abroad, you must still live in Ukraine and for Ukraine. No matter where you are on a working trip, you should still be with Ukraine and feel Ukrainians. The country is at war. You must be at war. Every day you should feel that the life of our state depends on your work, the lives of people and the situation on our land depend on it. Yesterday, as you know, we returned to Ukraine from the United States of America. And this was my first visit abroad after February 24 - to the key ally of our state, the United States. It was a fruitful visit. We have a decision on strengthening our air defense. The Congress is working on a powerful financial package for Ukraine and global security - 45 billion US dollars. We have significant strategic agreements with the United States for the coming months, which will definitely strengthen the capabilities of the most important thing - our defense forces in key directions. I urge you to consider this visit as a very important reference point, as a set bar. I don't have the opportunity of foreign visits - I just don’t, there's no time. As it was done before, in different conditions. I have opportunities to do this kind of work in other formats - and you know it, you've seen it. I think it was quite effective this year. But if any visit potentially has as significant, important, strategic content as my visit to the United States, if our Armed Forces, all our defense forces absolutely directly depend on the results of the visit, if one or another partner of ours is ready to take the lead in the implementation of the points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula, if there can be decisive steps to accelerate our victory, there can be my negotiations on a personal level as an exception to the general practice of wartime. You have to know what result you will potentially give in your direction. Fight for Ukraine, for strategic results for Ukraine! The second aspect: we must constantly create new opportunities for our state. This year we achieved historic results. It’s true. We have achieved and are increasing vital military, financial, sanction, humanitarian and other necessary support for Ukraine. Despite Russia's all-out war against us, against each and every one, we preserved the resilience of our state. A powerful global coalition has been created around Ukraine and the protection of international security, which unites not only traditional partners, but also – what is very important – states with which relations are just being built. Ukraine united the European Union in an unprecedented way and gained the status of a candidate for joining the EU. This is a great achievement. We applied for NATO membership. Historically significant results have been achieved in our cooperation with the UN and at the UN site. This applies both to Ukrainian export initiatives and to the decisions adopted for the sake of Ukraine, in particular the resolutions of the UN General Assembly. 143 countries of the world – more than ever before – supported our territorial integrity and condemned Russian aggression. Our grain export initiative enables the world to overcome the severity of the food crisis. More than 14 million tons of agricultural products were exported - you know - to more than forty countries of the world. We also launched the Grain from Ukraine humanitarian initiative. Both initiatives put our state in the same line with those who really guarantee global security for the whole world. And next year, we will increase this, I believe, very important activity of ours. Special attention is paid to those regions and continents where our interests are so far represented less than we need for the good of Ukraine and our protection against Russian aggression. In particular, this is Africa. We are already restarting relations with dozens of African countries. We have to step it up next year. Ten countries have already been determined where new embassies of Ukraine in Africa will be opened. We also developed the concept of the \"Ukraine - Africa\" trading house with the opening of its offices in the capitals of the most promising countries of the African continent. In addition to the existing representation of Ukraine in ten African countries - along with new embassies and trading houses - we must achieve representation in thirty countries of the African continent. Global growth and international stability in this century cannot be imagined without relations with Africa and other parts of the Global South: Latin America, India, other Asian countries, including China and Southeast Asia, the entire region of the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Ukraine must find the format of its leadership in strategic processes in each of these regions, and the role of the diplomatic corps of Ukraine will be decisive. We need passports for Ukraine's relations with each country, as it is currently done by us with African countries. I think the ministers, my colleagues, diplomatic institutions will explain this to you in more detail. We need clarity and defined intersection of our interests with partners and potential partners. It is necessary to bring the capacity of Ukraine to a new level in the foreign policy of emergency situations. We need such a tool that will enable our state to respond to crisis situations in the world. Our presence should be felt by absolutely everyone, everyone should be interested in our help. To this end, we are preparing the creation of the Ukrainian International Aid Agency, which will expand the geography of our influence and form additional lines of cooperation with partners. As we ensure the sustainability of our country together with our partners, we can also help other countries maintain and develop sustainability. As an example, we can consider our cooperation with partners in the field of food security, in the field of digitization and - which is very important, where we have really important developments - in cyber defense. We have experience that can strengthen our partners and give Ukraine new friends in the world. Of course, all this requires updating the regulations and ensuring the work of our diplomats. To this end, I commission the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to prepare an ambitious draft of amendments to the Law of Ukraine on the Diplomatic Service. The system of work of embassies must be updated. In order for embassies to be able to work truly as a team, the approach to the formation of the embassy team must be changed. The ambassador is responsible for the result, and therefore the ambassador needs to influence the formation of the embassy team. It will be done. Of course, injustice in financing the work of our representative offices, in particular in Africa, will also be corrected. The third aspect: the world should know about the needs of Ukraine and the needs of our people. Not only politicians, but also business, the very important media environment, and the civil sector. This is critically necessary for the reconstruction of Ukraine, for the restoration and development of the social and investment opportunities of our state, as well as for the pressure on Russia for this shameful war, for terror, to constantly increase. Our embassies and our state should be heard and seen in the countries of your direct work. In particular, one of your tasks, in addition to the general task of popularizing Ukraine, should be the organization of visits of those who can actually become and are newsmakers in the country of your stay. Take a look at examples of what has been done this year. Just a few examples, there were many of them, but still... For example, the Crimea Platform summit of the parliamentary dimension in Croatia - it was done jointly by the teams of Ruslan Stefanchuk, the government, the Office, all our diplomats. The conference on strengthening our energy sector and infrastructure in general, which took place in France and where Ukraine was represented by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Yulia Svyrydenko and Rostyslav Shurma. Agreements were reached in the amount of about 2 billion euros. The visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to Washington, her speech in Congress, meetings after which the possibility of a powerful strengthening of air defense opened up for Ukraine. A very important visit. Agreements regarding grain, which were dealt with by the team of Oleksandr Kubrakov and the team of the Office. The release of our prisoners of war, in particular the defenders of Mariupol and Azovstal, which was ensured by the team led by Andriy Yermak, Kyrylo Budanov and Rustem Umyerov, which is extremely important. The activity, which was aimed at obtaining candidate status, historical candidate status, and the corresponding visits and negotiations of Dmytro Kuleba, Olha Stefanishyna, Andriy Sybiha, Ihor Zhovkva, Emine Dzhaparova, Oleksiy Chernyshov - this entire team. We need this level of events for Ukraine next year. We need to create events that could talk about Ukraine and our interests. Political events of strategic importance. You should focus on this and ensure at least one such event per month for the sake of Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! Today, several special, very important areas of work in the coming year will be presented to you. In particular, the Head of my Office will present what can be done to implement the Ukrainian Peace Formula. I want to emphasize: this is a practical thing. Not some kind of abstraction, not some trick, not a rhetorical tool. This is a specific task, points that must be implemented in order to restore the territorial integrity of our state and guarantee the security of Ukraine and Ukrainians. There are more specific tasks for us for the next year. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to outline some of them, those we need to implement to make the next year a truly victorious year for all of us. So. Start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession to the EU. Preparation for the planned NATO summit and ensuring concrete results of this summit for Ukraine, which we all know about. Each of you will be presented with our updated defense and security needs for our army. You must constantly work to satisfy them. Ukrainian energy sector and, in general, the needs of our country for recovery after the Russian strikes, Fast Recovery Plan - please work as closely as possible with the government, the Office, international organizations and partner states, so that all these existing agreements are provided with a concrete content and result. Sanctions against Russia. We have to ensure new strong sanction packages next year. The terrorist state must feel real pressure, and your actions - the actions of our diplomatic corps - must be aimed at this. The Tribunal for the crime of aggression and the accountability of war criminals - work to ensure that the countries of your stay support us. Help find and block Russia’s assets linked not only to government officials, but also to Russian businesses that support the war. All these funds will be directed to the restoration of Ukraine. Do everything you can to ensure that the countries in which you work help build an effective compensation mechanism. And be sure to support our people not just as much as you can, but much more. They are facing extremely hard times. Work for our people to return to the state and for all their rights and legitimate interests in the host countries are satisfied. Ukrainian identity, Ukrainian cultural, educational, information and social needs must be satisfied. In everything, take as an example our work on \"Patriots\", \"NASAMS\", \"IRIS-T\", \"Crotale\". We were told that it was impossible. That all this was impossible. Now it's all there. Diplomacy is just such a tool. Everything that faces a \"no\" at the beginning must become a concrete result for all of us. The implementation of all the tasks I mentioned today is not only a specific work plan for the next year. We must understand: this is our victory, these are the elements of this victory. When we  implement a specific task, we accelerate victory for Ukraine, accelerate victory for our people. The most important task for all of us is victory in this war. We must, and we will get it! Glory to all our warriors! Gratitude to everyone who works for our victory! Thank you for all your work for our state in a particularly difficult time after February 24! I sincerely congratulate you on your day, your professional day - the Day of Diplomatic Service Employees - and I wish you all to achieve even more results in the coming year than this year. I wish you all a Merry Christmas, happy holidays, and a Happy New Year. May this year be victorious! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I held a meeting of the Staff today. It was as always substantive, but today more news for the troops after a visit to the United States. We are preparing for the coming months and next year in general. Our tasks are unchanged. It is the liberation of our land. Safety for our people. Restoration of our country after the Russian strikes. These are the elements of the Ukrainian victory, which we are approaching step by step. We heard today the commanders' reports at the Staff meeting. We see prospects at the front. We are preparing for different variants of actions of the terrorist state, we see its intentions. And we will respond. The situation in the energy sector was discussed separately. Today I held an important annual meeting with the ambassadors of Ukraine – the entire diplomatic corps of our country received tasks for the next year. We are preparing to step up Ukrainian diplomacy in several directions. The first are the countries in which our influence is still less than we need from the point of view of the national security of Ukraine and the interests of our people. First of all, these are the countries of Africa and other parts of the Global South – Latin America, Asian countries, and the Pacific region. This is a huge economic potential, and it is also a significant diplomatic opportunity. For example, during the voting of the UN General Assembly for resolutions that protect our territorial integrity and international law. We will strengthen Ukraine's position. The second aspect of Ukrainian diplomacy is to increase cooperation with our traditional partners so that the next year will really be decisive in this war and Ukraine will achieve all its goals. We are preparing to upgrade the diplomatic service, we will strengthen the Ukrainian embassies. There was also a non-public part of our meeting with diplomats today – I focused on several important, sensitive points in communication with the ambassadors. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. I am grateful for the new support package – very important, timely EUR 2.5 billion for Ukraine. Of course, our joint actions with the Netherlands next year were also discussed. We are coordinating the steps as much as possible, and I believe that there will be a tangible result, especially in the matter of bringing to justice all those who are guilty of this aggression against Ukraine. And one more. It was an honor for me to congratulate those people who, together with their colleagues, are restoring our systems after the Russian strikes. I believe that all of us should thank more often those who work for the preservation of our well-being and normal life. Not political at all. Maybe not always visible to most. But thanks to many of these people, Ukraine is living. In particular, anyone and everyone who repairs the grids and generation facilities damaged by the strikes, before the air alert has even ended, to give people power faster, is the true hero. Everyone who goes to the de-occupied and front-line areas to return everything for normal life to people is the real hero. Everyone who stabilizes our power system every day and every night, ensures the supply of electricity, the operation of plants and other energy facilities – all of them, along with others who fight and work for Ukraine, guarantee Ukraine's future. Thank you for that! I signed decrees on awarding our troops. 215 soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were given state awards. Glory to all who defend our state! Thanks to all our partners who help us and together with us are securing victory over tyranny! And please remember who is fighting against us. With the approaching holiday season, Russian terrorists may become active again. They despise Christian values and any values in general. Therefore, please heed the air raid signals, help each other and always take care of each other. And more. Citizens of Russia must clearly understand that terror never goes unanswered. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear people! These days, millions of people in Ukraine and the world celebrate Christmas. The appearance of the Son of God gave people hope for salvation, faith in the victory of goodness and mercy. Unfortunately, all the holidays have a bitter aftertaste for us this year. And we can feel the traditional Spirit of Christmas differently. Dinner at the family table cannot be so tasty and warm. There may be empty chairs around it. And our houses and streets can't be so bright. And Christmas bells can ring not so loudly and inspiringly. Through air raid sirens, or even worse – gunshots and explosions. And all this together can pose a bigger threat. It is a disappointment. Of the higher forces and their power, of goodness and justice in the world. Loss of hope. Loss of love. Loss of myself... But isn't this what evil and darkness, which have taken up arms against us, want in their essence? We have been resisting them for more than three hundred days and eight years. And will we allow them to achieve what they want? In this battle, we have another powerful and effective weapon. The hammer and sword of our spirit and consciousness. The wisdom of God. Courage and bravery. Virtues that incline us to do good and overcome evil. The main act of courage is endurance and completion of one's work to the end, despite everything. The truth illuminates our path. We know it. We defend it. Our truth is a struggle for freedom. Freedom comes at a high price. But slavery has an even higher price. Our path is illuminated by faith and patience. Patience and faith. These are twin forces. As it was said, \"he who rules and controls his own spirit, is better than he who captures a city.\" To endure does not mean to accept the circumstances. Patience is watching to make sure that we don't let any doubt or fear into our minds. It is faith in one's own strength. Evil has no weapon stronger than the armor given to us by God. Evil smashes against this armor like a stone wall. We have seen this more than once. We endured at the beginning of the war. We endured attacks, threats, nuclear blackmail, terror, missile strikes. Let's endure this winter because we know what we are fighting for. We go forward through the thorns to the stars, knowing what awaits us at the end of the road. God is a just Judge who rewards good and punishes evil. Which side we are on is obvious. Who is who in this battle is obvious. There are at least seven proofs of this – they are known - \"A proud look, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood, An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, Feet that be swift in running to mischief, A false witness that speaketh lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren.\" We oppose all this. Being a role model for others. The faithful, that is, those who really believe, must be a light to the rest of the world. For more than three hundred days, Ukrainians have been striving for this, proving it, serving as an example to others. We are not righteous, not holy, but we are definitely fighting for good and fighting for the light, with faith in Bible prophecy: \"Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. The people who walk in darkness will see a bright light. The light will shine on those who live in the land of death's shadow. For to us a child is born, to us a son is given!\" We believe that tears will be replaced by joy, hope will come after despair, and death will be defeated by life. Dear Ukrainian people! Today and all future winter holidays we meet in difficult circumstances. Someone will see the first star in the sky over Bakhmut, Rubizhne, and Kreminna today. Along thousands of kilometers of the front line. Someone is on the road, on the way – from the Ukrainian-Polish border to Kherson region or Zaporizhzhia. Someone will see it through the bullet holes of his or her own home. Someone will celebrate the holiday in other people's homes, but strange people's homes – homes of Ukrainians who gave shelter to Ukrainians. In Zakarpattia, Bukovyna, Lviv region, Ivano-Frankivsk region and many other regions. Someone will hear Shchedryk in another language - in Warsaw, Berlin, London, New York, Toronto and many other cities and countries. And someone will meet this Christmas in captivity, but let them remember that we are also coming for our people, we will return freedom to all Ukrainian men and women. Wherever we are, we will be together today. And together we will look at the evening sky. And together we will remember the morning of February 24. Let's remember how much we have passed. Let's remember Azovstal, Irpin, Bucha, Kramatorsk, Snake Island, Chornobayivka, Izium, Kherson. We make a wish. One for all. And we will feel joy. One for all. And we will understand the truth. One for all. About the fact that no kamikaze drones are capable of extinguishing the Christmas Dawn. We will see its glow even underground in a bomb shelter. We will fill our hearts with warmth and light. No Kinzhal missile can hurt them. They will break against our steel spirit. And our struggle will continue without stopping. It is not threatened by planned or emergency blackouts. And we will never feel a shortage of courage and indomitability. We have experienced a lot of bitter news and will deservedly receive good news. We will sing Christmas carols – cheerier than ever – louder than the sound of a generator. We will hear the voices and greetings of relatives – in our hearts – even if communication service and the Internet are down. And even in total darkness – we will find each other – to hug each other tightly. And if there is no heat, we will give a big hug to warm each other. We will celebrate our holidays! As always. We will smile and be happy. As always. The difference is one. We will not wait for a miracle. After all, we create it ourselves. Christ is born! Let's praise Him!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Today, millions of people celebrate Christmas according to the Gregorian calendar. And I once again congratulate everyone who is celebrating right now, these days. And I want us to once again express gratitude - together - to all those who both these days and at any other time are doing everything so that we can live. Live our life and in our country. I thank each of our warriors - all military personnel. All fighters of the Air Forces, anti-aircraft fighters, intelligence officers, border guards, national guardsmen, warriors of the territorial defense, Naval Forces. Thank you to every soldier and sailor, to every sergeant and sergeant-major, to every officer and general who are holding the front and trying to push it further - to our borders that we have to reach. Thanks to everyone who repairs and supplies equipment. To everyone who volunteers. Thanks to all our medics and everyone who saves the wounded on the battlefield. Thank you to all the nurses who perform their work selflessly under any circumstances. Thank you to everyone who helps provide hospitals with everything necessary. To all those who come to donate blood for the wounded... And to all those who came now in Kherson to help. To save the wounded from the attack of terrorists on Christmas... Artillery and mortars against ordinary streets of Kherson... Savages! We will find every Russian murderer. And I thank everyone who works for this: all investigative teams, all prosecutors, officials and diplomats. Thank you to each and everyone who helps get Ukrainians out of captivity. Thank you to all our energy workers and repairmen, sappers, policemen, employees of the State Emergency Service, utility workers. Thank you to the educators who continue to build our future and the builders who take care of our present. Thank you to the transporters who keep our economy alive and the financiers who maintain our stability. Thank you to the IT specialists who chose Ukraine. Thank you to officials who care about people and businesses who help society to be resilient. Thank you to our farmers, thank you to the agrarians who did not give up last spring and are preparing for the next one. Thank you to all journalists who spread the truth and public figures who help our people to keep faith in themselves and in victory. Thank you to all the leaders and peoples of the world, who this year, together with Ukraine, became leaders in the defense of freedom and next year, I believe, together with us, will do everything to become leaders of peace. It's possible. Fellow Ukrainians! There are only a few days left this year. We must be aware that our enemy will try to make this time dark and difficult for us. Russia lost everything it could this year. But it is trying to compensate for its losses with the gloating of its propagandists after the missile strikes at our country, at our energy sector. I know that the darkness will not prevent us from leading the occupiers to their new defeats. But we have to be ready for any scenario. Please pay attention to air alarms these days. Search again and remember where the nearest Point of Invincibility is located. Tell your parents how to find the Point of Invincibility if needed. More than 5,500 points have already been opened throughout the country. Please take care of yourself. And be ready to help others. When Ukrainians are together, when Ukrainians are grateful to each other, we cannot be defeated. May it always be so! And it will be so, I'm sure! Glory to our strong, beautiful, best people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on today - another day of another week of our resistance. First. The frontline. Bakhmut, Kreminna and other areas in Donbas, which now require maximum strength and concentration. The situation there is difficult, acute. The occupiers are using all the resources available to them - and these are significant resources - to squeeze out at least some advance. And I thank all our guys who hold their positions firmly, stand strong, and who nevertheless find opportunities not only to not lose anything, but also to drive the occupiers out, to \"subtract\" them. Today I want to celebrate the 10th separate mountain assault brigade for capturing the occupiers in the Donetsk region. It is very important. This will enable us to release more Ukrainians. I will also celebrate the 80th and 95th separate airborne assault brigades for the successful destruction of the enemy force in the Lyman direction. Well done, guys! The more the occupiers lose, the more time we all gain for Ukraine. Second. Energy sector. I want to thank all the workers of the energy companies, all the repair crews for the fact that this Saturday and Sunday - on Christmas Eve and Christmas - it was possible to give people more energy. Of course, deficits remain. Shutdowns continue. As of this evening, about 9 million people are disconnected in various regions of Ukraine. But the number and duration of outages is still gradually decreasing. I am thankful to each and everyone who made this result possible. Today I held a special meeting with government officials regarding the situation in the energy and infrastructure spheres. We are preparing for the next year - and not only for the winter months. There are threats that we have to eliminate. There are steps that need to be taken. And the state will definitely take them. Third. Today I held an extended meeting on the results of the visit to the USA and the implementation of the agreements. We will not waste time. We will quickly implement everything that was agreed upon in Washington. As much as possible. And one more thing. Today I spoke with the Prime Minister of India. Next year, it will be India that will preside over the G20. I wished Mr. Modi a fruitful presidency, and fruitful not for someone in particular, but for everyone in the world who values peace. India can be more active in efforts to end aggression, so I hope we can do more together for global stability in the coming year. Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine regardless of whether it's a holiday, a weekend, or a weekday! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps our country! And please don't forget to be prepared for Russian missile attacks or provocations. Air defense is preparing, the state is preparing, and everyone must prepare. Please pay attention to the sirens. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I held a meeting of the Staff today - the 44th of this year already. The topic is clear. First of all, it is Bakhmut, Kreminna and Donbas in general. Possible actions of the enemy in the eastern direction and our actions. We listened to the commanders, decided on steps for the near future. We continue to prepare the defense and security forces of Ukraine for the next year. It must be a crucial year. We understand the risks in the winter, we understand what we have to do in the spring, and therefore we understand what results the entire defense and security sector must demonstrate. The supply of ammunition and the repair of military equipment was discussed separately. By the way, I want to thank our specialists, all our partners, everyone involved in the relevant work. We managed to establish a system to not only return repaired equipment to the battlefield, but also to take trophy equipment from the battlefield and put it at the service of our country. This is a very important result of the year, everyone involved did a great job. I spoke today with the Prime Minister of Italy. I thanked for the support already provided and for the new support. Mrs. Meloni said that the issue of air defense for Ukraine is currently under consideration and we have coordinated our steps. I believe that Italian support will allow us to strengthen the defense of the Ukrainian sky. Of course, we also discussed our diplomatic plans for the coming months. And also the winter threats, which I am sure we will overcome together. I held a meeting today regarding the work of the banking system and our cooperation with the IMF. We must provide even more opportunities for Ukrainians in the coming year and guarantee the strength of our banking and financial systems. I also spoke with the head of the world's largest investment fund, BlackRock. I received another confirmation that the business of the developed world believes in our victory and is ready to invest in our reconstruction. Specialists of this company are already helping Ukraine to structure the Fund for the reconstruction of our state. And we are already preparing to participate in the World Economic Forum in Davos. The position and prospects of Ukraine will be presented there. In general, this week will be important for Ukraine from a political point of view. We are entering the next year and must retain a common understanding of our national goals. Of course, this is the liberation of our land from the enemy, as well as the restoration of Ukraine, the return of our people home, the further rapprochement of our state with key partners, the opening of new opportunities for Ukraine in the world - these are all tasks for the near future. And not only for the state, but also for each and every one of us. Soon I will present my view on the implementation of these tasks in the annual Message to the Verkhovna Rada on the external and internal situation of Ukraine. I want this Message to be not a report, but our conversation about the coming year. Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who fights for our independence! Thank you to all the units of our defense forces, which bring the defeat of the enemy closer! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Glory to Ukraine! Dear Mr. Chairman, dear people's deputies of our strong Ukraine, dear government officials! Dear guests, dear attendees! Dear Ukrainian warriors! Ukrainian people! Let's talk about Ukraine today. About how everyone has changed in these 10 months. And about how we changed the whole world. About our strength. All this time we were one. Just like now in this hall, when everyone answered - \"Glory to the heroes\". Glory to Ukraine! Due to our unity, we have achieved what almost no one in the world, in the whole world, believed in. Almost no one except us. Ukraine has become one of the global leaders. Our national colors are today an international symbol of courage and indomitability of the whole world. In any country, on any continent, when they see blue and yellow, they know that it is about freedom. About the people who did not give up, who endured, who united the world. And who will win. Thanks to Ukraine, the world believed that values give strength. This belief emerged following our struggle. The world became convinced that tyranny will lose. Following our faith. The world saw that freedom can be victorious. Following our achievements on the battlefield. And all our warriors. It will definitely happen. Ukraine will definitely win. In 10 months of this year, we helped everyone. We helped the West find itself again, return to the global arena and feel how much the West prevails. No one in the West is afraid of Russia anymore and will never be. We helped the European Union acquire real agency. We helped Europe feel like not several championships with teams of different levels, but one strong team that, together with the whole free world, is fighting for this important victory. It was Ukraine that united the European Union. It turned out that it is possible! And now Europe defends itself. Europe overcomes crises. And this is despite the colossal resources thrown by Russia to break our continent. Everything that Russia tried to do against Europe did not work. Every Russian step was a mistake. And our steps did work. And for the first time in history, the European Union is helping to defend against such large-scale aggression. For the first time, a number of EU countries have changed their legislation and political rules and are now providing armed support to our state. For the first time in history, some European countries have reconsidered the concept of neutrality and resist aggression together with us, together with Ukraine. We helped Europe and most of the world feel that being neutral now is, pardon me, immoral. 143 states voted for the resolution of the UN General Assembly in support of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the full implementation of the UN Charter. This is a really striking example. This is the biggest number in 10 months and 8 years. And I thank everyone who worked for this result. Unprecedentedly actively. Congratulations! This is a great victory! During this time after February 24, I alone had 850 international events. And this is how our entire diplomatic corps worked. Now I want to thank everyone who worked just like that, just as powerfully. All our diplomats, all our government officials and, of course, those people's deputies who helped the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Office build a pro-Ukrainian coalition in the world. I thank you! And I am thankful to all the leaders and nations who help us defend our independence, protect international law! Thank you to the honorable ambassadors of the countries - partners of ours, who are now present here, in this distinguished hall! Fellow Ukrainians! Look at how global priorities have changed. Most of the countries of the world are no longer interested in whether Russia will hear them. That's no longer the case. Now the world is really interested in what else to expect from Ukraine, what else Ukraine can give to Europe, what we can give to the world. For many people in the world, it is now pride to have friends among Ukrainians. Remember how Ukrainians once wanted to have friends among foreigners. And now we are truly one with the world - with the strongest, with the freest in the world. We restore faith in values to millions of people in different countries. In the values that parents teach their children anywhere in the free world. We show that life should really depend on such values. We actualize the meanings. Meanings that were, unfortunately, only barren letters of some international agreements, conventions and memoranda for a long time. They will work. And we show it. We give each of our partners a unique and very important feeling and a historic opportunity - to be a winner together with Ukraine. Thanks to Ukrainians, the world remembers what it means to be winners. Next year we will only strengthen it. This year, we obtained for Ukraine the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. But our achievement is not only in this. This is only part of the achievement. Ukraine has long deserved this status. We know. Even 20 years ago, we could have been there, with this status. Now our achievement is much greater. Ukraine cements. It cements the European Union and the entire free world with the struggle for freedom and peace. This is our main achievement in foreign policy for the past year. We made it obvious to everyone that no union in Europe would be strong without Ukraine. And that is why in all the countries of the European Union, a clear majority of citizens supported Ukraine and the idea of Ukraine joining the EU, and the majority sees us in the Alliance. It is time to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union. Fellow Ukrainians! I want us now to thank all those who opened this opportunity and this path to us. I want us to thank our warriors. Warriors! Our warriors, exactly warriors, Ukrainian heroes, are not just servicemen. Not just soldiers and sailors, not just sergeants, not just officers and generals. The warriors are the hope of millions of people for life. They are Europe's hope for peace. They are the hope of the world that the time of empires cannot return. Ukrainian warriors gain peace for us. And they will gain it! Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! To the National Guard, our border guards, our intelligence, Security Service, Special Operations Forces, National Police! Glory to all our Defense and Security Forces! Glory to Ukraine! Today, the Ukrainian warriors prove that greatness does not depend on the size of the state, the stockpile of missiles, or the ability to force someone into something. Greatness depends on the strength of morale of those who defend their home, defend the freedom of their people. The Ukrainian warriors ousted the invaders from around Kyiv, and this was the first turning point in the full-scale war. It showed the strength of our resistance. The Ukrainian warriors freed Zmiinyi, and since then every occupier knows the only answer he will hear from the Ukrainians to any of his encroachments. This showed that nothing can stop Ukraine. The number of flagships has somewhat decreased in the Black Sea, and one infamous bridge is increasingly operating for exit rather than entry. If it is operating, of course. And it showed what the future would be like. It will be Ukrainian. The active actions of our Defense and Security Forces in the Kharkiv region turned many pages of old history. Perhaps, the Russian army did not know that it was capable of fleeing so quickly. Fleeing, leaving everything behind - positions, weapons, their soldiers and collaborators. The occupiers fled, although they had an advantage in this direction - in the number of weapons, equipment and soldiers. But our warriors had - and have - another great advantage. A more significant one. The advantage in determination, the advantage of the strength of your land under your feet. We reinforce this advantage of Ukrainian warriors with powerful weapons. We have such weapons for the first time. HIMARS and Krab, Harpoon and NASAMS, Bayraktar and M777 howitzers, CAESAR, Bushmaster, IRIS-T, Crotale - I have named only a few of the dozens of types of the best weapons in the world, which our warriors already have or will have. I am grateful to our partners! We have already managed to liberate more than one thousand eight hundred cities and villages of Ukraine from the Russian occupier. And I thank all the states that help us overcome Russian tyranny right on the battlefield! And let me remind you that a year ago it seemed impossible that our country would have Patriot air defense systems. Now we have such an agreement. I am grateful to our strategic partners! This is a special sign of trust in Ukraine. This is a true alliance with the United States of America. We have achieved this. And I have a debt after my visit to the United States, which I want to pay off right now. Captain Pavlo Cherniavskyi is now in this hall, commander of the HIMARS battery who was awarded the Cross of Combat Merit and who presented this award to President of the United States of America Biden. It was an honor to carry out this special mission. But it also has a second part. In response, President Biden handed over a Command Coin – a special symbol from the President of the United States of America. Mr. Captain! Pavlo! I have to give this Command Coin to you now. Once again, I want to thank President Biden, both parties of Congress and every American family for the historical support of Ukraine and our citizens. Thank you! Fellow Ukrainians! You see, dear Ukrainians, how the whole world helps us and how we get advanced weapons. Rest assured, the time will come when the whole world will be equally interested in Ukrainian weapons brands. We are capable of producing our missiles, our naval drones, we are already doing it, armored vehicles, aircraft and other types of weapons. We are already doing it. There is ours already. It's all ours. \"Stugna\", \"Vilkha\", \"Neptune\", marine drone and others. Let's thank our domestic production. Ukraine and the Ukrainian military-industrial complex was and will be one of the most powerful in Europe and the world, I am sure of that. The intensity of hostilities, the depth of the evil that Russia has brought, the volume and brutality of the crimes of the occupiers on our Ukrainian land encourage not only us, but also the whole world to update defense standards, update security standards, and achieve justice. And this applies to many areas. From the production of projectiles and tactics on the battlefield to the creation of a new effective security architecture for Ukraine, for all of Europe and the world, new security guarantees. From the launch of legal mechanisms to bring to justice all those guilty of aggression and to compensate at the expense of Russia for all the damage caused by this terror, to the reform of existing international organizations that are supposed to guarantee peace, guarantee international law and order, but are unable to do so now. Ukraine is already among the leaders of the relevant processes. And, by the way, it is in Ukraine that new NATO standards are defined by our heroic warriors. Standards we share with our allies today. Allies! Not just partners. But in order to get to that time and those opportunities, we have to come to an agreement between ourselves now. All of us in this hall, in Ukraine, within our people, our society. The first point is unity. We have to cherish it despite any personal emotions, any personal interests. Unity is what allows us now to strengthen society, strengthen our state, win together and change the negative trends of our centuries-old history. The stronger the unity, the greater and faster our victory will be. We must be equal in unity. Equal in unity. And this is now a challenge. A very important point. No one at the front will understand those who, having any political weight or any position of authority, will try to return to the old life. Life before February 24. And if someone tries to play against the independence of Ukraine - be it political, economic, or spiritual independence - our state will respond instantly and in a tough way. There is no such gold for crosses or anything else in the world that could cover the moral rust from ties with a terrorist state. And if someone from the political class of Ukraine thinks that when he skis down the mountain, he motivates the soldiers to climb out of the trenches and go on the offensive, this is a sign of madness, and there will be no such people in politics. I urge everyone to leave their personal ambitions at home and work to protect our common home. Work together with the state and in a way that is necessary to protect freedom and our people. When such a brutal war is ongoing, it is not the time for personal political guerrilla activity somewhere in the rear, in the media, or even more so in the capitals of the countries that help us. Please take my words as seriously as possible. Ukraine is on its way to the victory that generations of our people have dreamed of. Now our children dream of it. Our parents and grandparents dreamed of it. All generations from the time of Bohdan to the national liberation struggle of the XX century. We will get what we did not achieve before. We will. And this is possible thanks to the fact that for the first time in several centuries we simultaneously have national unity, our own functioning state and the maximum unity of the world in supporting our beautiful Ukraine. We will not let anyone \"roll it back\" to the old days. People will not allow it. The world will not allow it. Our unity must be as strong as our warriors. The second point is security. Being one of the global leaders is not a status or an award. This is an ongoing process. The process of finding new opportunities for our state, new friends and alliances, new growth for the economy and for our society. In the same way, the security of the state is not a state that you achieve once and for all, it is difficult work, it is a process. Leadership and security always go hand in hand - by acquiring one, you work for the other. Now, when the enemy has set himself the goal of destroying us, destroying our energy sector, we set ourselves the goal of becoming a leader in the transformation of our energy sector to counter any threats, any challenges - military, political, economic or even climatic. We have to become - and we will become, as there is no other option - a leader in building modern green energy. This will allow us to create a decentralized energy system that cannot be destroyed by anything, any missile strikes. Today - everyone can see - it is dangerous when cities depend on several large thermal or power plants. A modern city needs decentralized sources of energy. Only green energy can really provide this. Having a leadership position in such energy and developing our atomic generation, as well as hydrogen energy, we will be able to provide for the needs of Ukraine, and in peacetime - the needs of Europe. And this will be a historic strengthening of Ukraine's role in Europe. We can, and therefore must, become one of the guarantors of European energy security. And this is a task, a task for tomorrow. And today we have to get through and we will definitely get through this winter. Russian missile and, as they say, \"shahed\" strikes at our energy sector, at the energy supply of Ukrainians, is an obvious challenge not only to our state, by the way. When terror strikes against the civilization of life, the world can stand up for both civilization and life. We do everything for this. I want to thank everyone who advocates for increasing international pressure on Russia for this terror! And I thank all the countries and companies, international organizations and people who supply us with equipment and provide financial support to provide the people of Ukraine with light, heat and communication! Thank you! One example - we will increase the number of Starlink terminals in Ukraine, which clearly prove the superiority of civilization over terror and barbarism, to more than thirty thousand in the near future. We are already becoming - and we will become - a leader in the digital transformation of our state and society. I think it is not necessary to dwell separately on what we have achieved in the field of digitization and communication. I will only say that this is an achievement of such importance that allows us to make our country's experience in digitization one of the tools of foreign policy. We will complete the total digitization of all permits and public services in Ukraine. This is about anti-corruption and about the stability of the institutions of our state. And what is important, by spreading such experience of transformation, successful experience in the world, we will provide Ukraine with new friends, new alliances, new political and economic opportunities. In particular, this will concern the development of relations with African countries and other states of the Global South. This direction of foreign policy received a special priority. We are already becoming - and we will become - the leader of global efforts for food security. This year has shown that without a Ukrainian farmer, without Ukrainian agricultural exports, it is impossible to guarantee not only food, but also social security for dozens of countries in Africa, Asia and Europe. Our two initiatives - the Export Grain Initiative and the \"Grain from Ukraine\" program - have returned the world to vital stability. More than fifteen million tons of food for export to more than forty countries of the world in just five months in conditions of full-scale war is our first grain initiative. And I want to thank the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, I thank President of Türkiye Erdoğan for supporting the restoration of our agricultural exports. Already more than thirty donor countries and almost two hundred million dollars - this is our second grain initiative, a humanitarian one. The European Union and Qatar, Türkiye and Japan, Norway and Korea, Canada and the United States of America - this is just the beginning of the global humanitarian corridor for countries facing the threat of famine. Famine caused by Russia. Even now, when it's hard for us, we share our Ukrainian bread with those for whom it is even harder. I thank you for this - everyone who did it! This moral leadership of Ukraine and our partners is undeniable. Ukraine must always look for ways to show leadership, to attract other leaders, and every such success will strengthen our security, strengthen the external situation of our state. But also the internal one. Our export initiatives and, in general, the expansion of opportunities for freight transportation through the territory of the European Union, Türkiye - allowed us to save millions of jobs for Ukrainians. Dear attendees! I am asking you now to thank all our transporters, all our port workers, all those who work on the railways, in every other industry that ensures the movement of goods for Ukrainians! Another important security element. Business is also the protection of Ukraine now. Taxes are also security now. This year we had no delays - or almost no delays - with the salaries of our beloved teachers and doctors. Pensions were indexed, as provided by the legislation of Ukraine. In the de-occupied territory, payments were made as soon as stabilization measures were completed there. More than one trillion two hundred billion hryvnias are allocated to defense for the year. Of course, the financial assistance of partners and other involved funds played an important role, that's true. But. But there is a but. We must remember that the financing of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is primarily an internal resource from Ukrainian taxes, customs duties, bonds and other similar sources. And every unpaid hryvnia of taxes is money taken from our military. This is the fact. Of course, the existing tax system is convenient neither for those who pay taxes nor for those who collect taxes. It is also not convenient for those of our people who receive salaries and pensions from these taxes.  But it is extremely important for us to reach a national agreement on this issue. Now I want to thank everyone who keeps their businesses running, who keeps jobs so that people can provide for themselves and their families, who pays taxes. Gratitude to all of you! I want to emphasize this again and want you all to know: very important international aid goes to important social benefits. And the entire resource for the salaries of the military is paid by the citizens of Ukraine. The third point is justice. The creation of the Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression is an integral part of the policy of our state. I am sure that the Tribunal will work. The International compensation mechanism, which we are currently building, will also work. At the same time, we must cooperate as much as possible with our international partners, with the International Criminal Court. That is, all elements of international and national justice will be used to bring to justice the Russian murderers and torturers, all those who planned, started and are carrying out aggression against the people of Ukraine. No crime committed by the occupiers in Ukraine can go unpunished. And no matter how much resources and time it takes, accountability for the occupiers must be unavoidable. And it will be so! For everything that was done against Ukraine, that was done against Ukrainians from 2014 and from February 24. Can the state alone ensure this? No. And I want to thank our partners, in particular, the Netherlands, for their principled leadership in this work; all our investigators, experts, prosecutors, all our judges who are already working on this, and all journalists and public activists who joined justice. Thank you! I am also thankful to those who help us find and block the assets of the terrorist state and its associated persons in foreign jurisdictions, who promote important legislative initiatives in other states to confiscate these assets of the Russian Federation, and also advocate this in the media! We will do everything to bring home all our people who are currently in Russian captivity. The goal of restoring the territorial integrity of Ukraine always goes hand in hand for us with another goal of freeing all our people who are held in Russian captivity or in prisons, as well as all those who were forcibly deported from our land. After February 24, our team managed to free 1,456 people from Russian captivity. This is significant. I am happy to see everyone who returns to Ukraine. But there is much more work ahead. However, I have no doubt that we will fulfill it together, in a united manner. Reconstruction of Ukraine after hostilities is another component of justice. It is already clear that this will be the biggest economic project of our time in Europe. The scope of what needs to be done is obvious to everyone and requires a separate enumeration now. I will mention very briefly only the key principles. The entire territory of our state needs reconstruction of those infrastructure, energy, social sphere and other objects that do not meet modern security requirements. We have to raise from the ruins the territory entered by the Russian invaders after February 24. In the same way, we will restore the normality of life in the territory of Donbas and Crimea, which were illegally occupied in 2014 and have been brought to the point of disaster by the occupiers over the time that has passed. Now it is still difficult to estimate the required amount of resources. But it can be said for sure that we should prioritize the restoration of those companies that were in Ukraine or that came to Ukraine during the war. Which left the Russian market during the war. And this is fair. Who supported us in the most difficult moments, who were with us when Ukraine was fighting for life, who worked, who paid taxes, who volunteered, who helped our indomitability... We need to find a format to give such business more opportunities in such important projects, the projects of a new, rebuilt Ukraine. Ukrainian business, American, French, Polish - any that we see - here and now. And I ask you, dear people's deputies, together with us, together with the Office, together with the Government to develop such a legislative framework. And this will also, I think, encourage international business to enter Ukraine now - preparing for the future, for the victory. And one more thing. Just as we must restore territorial integrity, we must also restore social integrity. Millions of our people who have become displaced persons, who have found shelter abroad, should not become refugees. I thank all the countries, I thank all the nations of Europe and the world who help our people! But we must preserve them as a part of Ukrainian society. We have to ensure their return. And this includes various components of work. Security guarantees, economic growth. Reconstruction and further integration of our state with the European Union and other leading subjects of the free world. Protection of human rights, equalization of social and personal freedoms in Ukraine and in advanced countries of stay of our migrants. Creating a modern veteran policy. It’s very important! Creation of a modern rehabilitation system in Ukraine for those who were put in the most difficult position by the war. So that our society has this feeling that no one is needless among us - this is the task... That we care about all Ukrainians, that we can help each and every one of them. A country that supports every its citizen is a country that you want to return to. We have to make sure that when the world sees the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag of ours, they will know that it is about freedom and about people who have a strong home and who will always be helped - no matter what happens to them. Because we are all Ukrainians. And that's enough. I thank you for your attention! Glory to all who fight and work for our country! Glory to all who help us protect our independence, our freedom! Glory to all of you, our people! Glory to Ukraine! I wish all of us victory and only victory in the coming year. Nothing else is needed! Happy upcoming holidays. Thank you all for this difficult year! We thank our warriors, our people of beautiful Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! eToday - so it turned out - is the day of summing up this year and plans for the next year. I held a meeting with officials specializing in international relations regarding events and plans for January. I met with the Minister of Defense of France who arrived in Ukraine. We discussed cooperation over the year, the reconstruction of our country and another step in strengthening our air defense. Thank you, France! I met with government officials and heads of parliamentary committees. We discussed the solutions that are being prepared. Today, I also delivered the annual Message to the Verkhovna Rada on the external and internal situation of Ukraine. About how we all - all Ukrainians - changed the world this year and what we will do next year. Probably, you could already see the highlights of all these events in the news, or you will see them. I would like to add one more thing to everything that was done and said today. Add something non-political. No matter what is happening and what is on your mind, support each other. Necessarily. Please take the time to say kind words to those close to you. Even if these are not people close to you - just to other Ukrainians. Please find an opportunity and a moment to thank for the work, to praise for this or that effort, for the care. And if a person is in such a difficult situation, at such a difficult time, remains alone and for some reason does not have relatives, please ask if he or she needs help. Or just help without even asking. If you know that a person is waiting for a son or daughter from the war, please pay attention: say hello, listen, help. Hug your family more often. Tell your friends more often how much you appreciate them. Support colleagues more often. Thank your parents more often. Rejoice with children more often. Do not forget to call when relatives are waiting, even just to hear: how are you? Do not forget to write messages to friends and acquaintances at least sometimes - you should not lose contact now. And please don't forget to say thank you when you've been helped. Please try to support those who fight for our country. Our attention to others, when it may be lacking from one of our relatives - for various reasons, our words that can warm those around us when events are too cold, and our care for each other when circumstances are challenging - all this is also our common defense. We have not lost our humanity even though we have gone through terrible months. And we will not lose it even though there is also a difficult year ahead. We will reach victory. And we have to do it really together. Take care of Ukraine, appreciate each other and do everything to help our warriors! Every day - until victory. Glory to all our people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! First of all, I want to thank our Air Forces servicemen, Ukrainian air defense, which successfully repelled another Russian attack today. 54 missiles and 11 attack drones were shot down. Our warriors all over Ukraine distinguished themselves, and I thank all our Air Commands: Center, South, East and West. And especially we are grateful to the warriors of the 96th Kyiv, 160th Odesa, 208th Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades, whose results are the best today. Unfortunately, there were several hits. Our power engineers and repair crews are doing everything to make Ukrainians feel the consequences of the terrorists' strike as little as possible. And I thank everyone who is working to restore energy supply. As of this evening, there are power outages in most regions of Ukraine. It is especially difficult in Kyiv region and the capital, Lviv region, Odesa and the region, Kherson and the region, Vinnytsia region and Zakarpattia. But this is nothing compared to what could have happened, if it was not for our heroic anti-aircraft troops and air defense. With each such missile strike, Russia is only driving itself deeper into a dead end. They have fewer and fewer missiles. Instead, the status of the biggest terrorist in the world will have consequences for Russia and its citizens for a long time. And each missile only confirms that all this must end with a tribunal. And that is exactly what will happen. And despite all the strikes, the state works every day. The Office, the Cabinet of Ministers - everyone is working. In particular, today I had two large meetings, economic and defense. We are working to ensure that our defenders have more opportunities, more weapons, more drones. The situation on the frontline remained without significant changes over the last day. The most acute situation is in Bakhmut, Soledar, over the entire line in the Donetsk region. The enemy has not abandoned the insane idea to capture the Donetsk region... Now they set themselves a task - for the New Year. I am grateful to all our guys who have been proving to the occupiers for months that it is us who  will set and achieve goals on our land. I am grateful to everyone who defends the Ukrainian Donbas! To all who defend our Kharkiv region! To all who keep our south! Who protect our border...  And, by the way, I thank those border guards who, together with all the defense forces, are fighting the enemy at the front. I thank the warriors of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi and Mukachevo border guard detachments. Dear Ukrainians! There are two days left in this year. Perhaps, the enemy will try once again to make us celebrate the New Year in darkness. Perhaps, the occupiers are planning to make us suffer with the next strikes at our cities. But no matter what they plan, we know one thing about ourselves: we will endure. For sure. We will drive them out. No doubts about that. And they will face punishment for this terrible war. The maximum punishment. I thank everyone who defends our state! I thank everyone who fights for our independence! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I held another meeting of the Staff – already the 45th this year. The main thing is Donetsk region, Luhansk region – our Donbas, where the fiercest battles are going on. Bakhmut, Soledar, Kreminna... In general, we hold our positions. There are also areas of the front where we are slowly advancing. And I thank all our soldiers who ensure this. You are real heroes! We discussed the situation in the south, on our border, the supply of weapons, and the further strengthening of air defense. This year, we not only maintained our air defenses, but we made them stronger than ever. But in the new year Ukrainian air defense will become even stronger, even more effective. Ukrainian air defense can become the most powerful in Europe, and this will be a guarantee of security not only for our country, but also for the entire continent. After the meeting of the Staff, at a separate meeting we discussed the situation in the energy industry, what we are preparing for. We have a clear strategy for ensuring the generation and supply of electricity. It takes time to implement it. It takes a lot of effort. But it will be. It will be mandatory. It is one of the most important tasks for the next year, and I have no doubt that we will accomplish it. Today I spoke with the Prime Minister of Greece. We summarized the year, and I thanked Greece for supporting our country. We agreed for next year how we can make cooperation even more meaningful. I held a meeting with our diplomats. There are many questions, but the main thing is the measures we are preparing to strengthen Ukraine already in January and February. Ukraine will retain the achieved leadership in foreign policy and will be even more active, that's for sure. And one more. Today, for the first time, the ceremony of awarding our volunteers with the Golden Heart took place. It is fair and honest – at the end of the year, to recognize those who help our defense, help people and our entire state all year long. Thank you to everyone who fights for our country. Who helps Ukrainians. Who works for Ukraine and our future. Glory to all our people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "December 31st... Today, this Russian missile attack is not the end of the year, no matter how much the terrorists want it. It's the outcome of Russia's fate. The terrorist state will not be forgiven. And those who give orders for such strikes, and those who carry them out, will not receive a pardon. To put it mildly. Several missile attack waves on New Year's Day. Missiles against people. It's against the people. NONhumans did it, NONhumans will lose. And you and I know it. Terrorists cannot change it. At Easter, they made such attacks, at Christmas, at New Year... They call themselves Christians, they are very proud of their Orthodoxy. But they are following the devil. They support him and are together with him. And I'll tell you about it in Russian. All this war that you are waging, you are Russia, it is not the war with NATO, as your propagandists lie. It is not for something historical. It's for one person to remain in power until the end of his life. And what will be with all of you, citizens of Russia, does not concern him. Your leader wants to show that he has the troops behind him and that he is ahead. But he is just hiding. He hides behind the troops, behind missiles, behind the walls of his residences and palaces. He hides behind you and burns your country and your future. No one will ever forgive you for terror. No one in the world will forgive you for this. Ukraine will never forgive. And you yourself will not forgive him everything that he will destroy and everyone whom he will kill. Citizen of Ukraine! All our services work where there were missile hits. We provide assistance to those affected. Kyiv, Khmelnytsky, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv this time... Unfortunately, there are casualties... My condolences to the families. Most of the missiles have been intercepted by our air defense forces. And these are lives saved. If it were not for air defense, the number of casualties would have been different. Much bigger. And this is yet another proof for the world that support for Ukraine must be increased. I thank all the partners who helped with the air defense. IRIS-T, Crotale, NASAMS, Hawk. MANPADS Perun, Mistral, etc. Next year it will be Patriot. This year, a lot of S-300s were made, which we also received. Each of these systems is a counter to terror, it's what proves the strength of normal people and the ineffectiveness of terrorists. A weapon against terror is a means for peace. And every day – today is no exception – we release our people. A total of 140 people were returned from Russian captivity today. 22 officers, 118 privates and sergeants. In total, since February 24, we have returned home 1,596 Ukrainian men and women. Thanks to our team! Thanks to everyone who protects Ukraine! To everyone who is now on the front line! Thanks to everyone who fights for our country! Thanks to Air Defense Forces! And please, citizens, don't ignore the sirens. Thanks to our energy workers - everyone who removes the consequences of terrorist attacks. It will be the New Year now. We'll be in touch with you the whole time! We are all working. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! This year began on February 24. Without prefaces and preludes. Sharply. Early. At 4 o'clock. It was dark. It was loud. It was hard for many and scary for some. 311 days have passed. It can still be dark, loud, and complicated for us. But we will definitely never be afraid again. And we'll never be ashamed. It was our year. Year of Ukraine. Year of Ukrainians. We woke up on February 24. Into another life. Being another people. Another Ukrainians. The first missiles finally destroyed the labyrinth of illusions. We saw who was who. What friends and enemy are capable of, and most importantly, what we are capable of. On February 24, millions of us made a choice. Not a white flag, but a blue and yellow flag. Not escaping, but meeting. Meeting the enemy. Resisting and fighting. The explosions on February 24 stunned us. Since then we have not heard everything. And we don't listen to everyone. We were told: you have no other option but to surrender. We say: we have no other option than to win. On February 24, we began to create our victory. From many bricks – hundreds of other victories. We have overcome the panic. We did not run away but united. We have overcome doubts, despair, and fear. We believed in ourselves and in our strength. The Armed Forces of Ukraine. Intelligence. National Guard. SBU. Special Operations Forces. Border guards. Territorial defense forces. Air defense forces. The police. The State Emergency Service. All our defense and security forces. I am proud of you all, our warriors! This year can be called a year of losses for Ukraine, for the whole of Europe, and the whole world. But it's wrong. We shouldn't say that. We haven't lost anything. It was taken from us. Ukraine did not lose its sons and daughters – they were taken away by murderers. Ukrainians did not lose their homes – they were destroyed by terrorists. We did not lose our lands – they were occupied by invaders. The world did not lose peace – Russia destroyed it. This year has struck our hearts. We've cried out all the tears. All the prayers have been yelled. 311 days. We have something to say about every minute. But most of the words are superfluous. They are not needed. No explanations or decorations are needed. Silence is needed to hear. Pauses are needed to realize. The morning of February 24. Hostomel. Bucha. Irpin. Borodianka. Kharkiv. Mriya. Kramatorsk Station. Toy. Chernihiv. Mariupol. Drama Theater. The word \"Children\" written. Olenivka. Odesa. Multi-story building. Girl. Three months old. Vilniansk. Maternity hospital. Baby. Two days old. Azovstal. It's impossible to forget. And it's impossible to forgive. But it's possible to win. We stood on our feet because there was something that kept us going. Our spirit. Defense of Kyiv. Kharkiv. Mykolaiv. Chornobayivka. Snake Island. HIMARS. Antonivsky Bridge. \"Cotton\" pops. Crimean Bridge. Neptune. Cruiser Moskva. Russian warship. Izyum, Balakliya and Kupyansk. Kherson. And we pray that there will be Kreminna and Svatove, Melitopol, all of Donbas, Crimea. We fight and will continue to fight. For the sake of the main word: \"victory.\" It will be for sure. We are approaching it for 311 days. We gave it a lot of strength. But at the moment, when it seems that you can't go any further, remember that we have already passed with you. I want to say to all of you: Ukrainians, you are incredible! See what we have done and what we are doing! How our soldiers have been smashing this \"second army of the world\" since the first days. How our people stopped their equipment and infantry columns. How an old man used his hands to stop a tank. How a woman knocked down a drone with a jar of tomatoes. How enemy tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters, shells were stolen during the occupation. How we fundraised for Shahed hunters, naval drones, armored vehicles, ambulance vehicles and Bayraktar drones in several hours. How we withstood all threats, shelling, cluster bombs, cruise missiles, darkness and cold. How we supported each other and the state. Everyone is important in war. Who holds a weapon, the steering wheel of a car, the helm of a ship or plane, a scalpel, or a pointer. Everyone who is behind a laptop, who drives a combine harvester, a train. Who is at a roadblock and a power plant. Journalists and diplomats, utility workers and rescuers. All. Who is working. Studying at a university or school. And even those who are just learning to walk. All this is for their sake. Our children. Our people. Our country. There are no small matters in a great war. There are no unnecessary ones. Each of us is a fighter. Each of us is a front. Each of us is the basis of the defense. We fight as one team – the whole country, all our regions. I admire you all. I want to thank every invincible region of Ukraine. Kharkiv. Mutilated but unconquered. You proved to the enemy that being close territorially does not mean being close in mind. Kharkiv is a Ukrainian city. The hero city. Invincible Mykolaiv. Heroically withstands all blows. The city on a wave that overcomes all storms. Sumy city and the region. You were one of the first to feel the full-scale invasion of the invaders. Sumy region became a bone in their throat for them. Ordinary people made Molotov cocktails, burned enemy columns, took the first prisoners. Sumy region is a force. Dnipro. The support and reliable rear of our front. You received people, you got the lives of wounded soldiers back. Despite constant barrages, Dnipro lives on. Odesa. Sunny and friendly, now a fortress. World fortress. Which defends us and which defends the world. Feeds it by sending millions of tonnes of salvation by sea every day. Because it is Odesa Mama. Kherson! You are heroic people! You have been under occupation for more than eight months. No news. No communication. Separated from Ukraine. Thousands of you took part in actions against the ruscists. You did not know whether we saw it in Ukraine or knew about it. The occupiers lied to you that Ukraine abandoned you and would not fight for you. But you believed and waited despite everything. The face of Kherson is cut by fragments of shells, but the main thing is that we welcome the New Year free and together under blue and yellow flags. And therefore, we will restore everything, rebuild everything. Just like Chernihiv and Zaporizhzhia, and Kramatorsk, and Bakhmut. Those that became a refuge for millions of Ukrainians: Rivne, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Vinnytsia. I thank you! Those who receive and transfer millions of tonnes of aid from Europe and the world: Lviv, Uzhgorod, Chernivtsi, Lutsk. Thank you! Those who accept the evacuation of businesses, enterprises, universities: Khmelnytsky, Zhytomyr, Kropyvnytsky, Poltava, Cherkasy. Thank you! And those who are waiting for Ukraine. And will wait. Donbas, Luhansk region, Crimea. Thanks to you, our warriors! And, of course, Kyiv region and the city are our heart, which always beats thanks to you, all our Ukrainians! We are all one family. One Ukraine. This is the year when Ukraine changed the world. And the world discovered Ukraine. We were told to surrender. We chose a counterattack! We were told to make concessions and compromises. We are joining the European Union and NATO. The world heard Ukraine. European Parliament, Bundestag, the UK Parliament, Knesset, the US Congress. The world felt Ukraine. Ukraine in the media. In the hearts of people. At the top of Google search. The world saw Ukraine. On the main squares in Toronto, New York, London, Warsaw, Florence, Sydney, and other cities. Ukrainians surprise. Ukrainians are applauded. Ukrainians inspire. Is there anything that can scare us? No. Is there anyone who can stop us? No. Because we are all together. It is what we are fighting for. One for each other. The best salute for us is at the warehouses of the occupiers. The best gift is the numbers in the report of the General Staff. We do not know for sure what the new year 2023 will bring us. But ready for anything. New achievements? We will be happy. New hits? We will be steadfast. Continuation of the fight? We will fight. And when we win, we will hug. Dear Ukrainians! A few minutes remain until the New Year. I want to wish all of us one thing – victory. And that's the main thing. One wish for all Ukrainians. Let this year be the year of return. The return of our people. Soldiers – to their families. Prisoners – to their homes. Immigrants – to their Ukraine. Return of our lands. And the temporarily occupied will become forever free. Return to normal life. To happy moments without curfew. To earthly joys without air alerts. The return of what has been stolen from us. The childhood of our children, the peaceful old age of our parents. So that grandchildren come to visit their grandparents during the holidays. To eat watermelons in Kherson. And the cherry in Melitopol. So that our cities are free. Our friends are faithful. And so that our main figure and main success appeared in reports near the figure of 100,000 destroyed enemies, thousands of units of destroyed Russian equipment – it is 603,628 square kilometers. The area of independent Ukraine, as it was since 1991. As it will always be. May the New Year bring all this. We are ready to fight for it. That's why each of us is here. I'm here. We are here. You are here. Everyone is here. We are all Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine! Happy New Year!"

  "speech": "I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! New year, new day, new summaries. 45 \"Shaheds\" were shot down on the first night of the year. I thank our Air Forces - pilots, anti-aircraft warriors. 33 \"Shaheds\" are on their account. Gratitude to the air defense of our Ground Forces for another 12 downed Iranian drones. Well done, guys! Russian terrorists were pathetic, and they entered this year staying the same. Our defenders were awesome, and on January 1 they showed themselves very well. You know, these days it was clearly seen how far we have moved away, mentally, humanly from what Russia is \"boiling\" in. Our sense of unity, authenticity, life itself - all this contrasts dramatically with the fear that prevails in Russia. They are afraid. You can feel it. And they are right to be afraid. Because they are losing. Drones, missiles, anything else will not help them. Because we are together. And they are together only with fear. And they will not take away a single year from Ukraine, they will not take away our independence. We will not give them anything. I thank everyone who is fighting the enemy at the frontline every day and every night! We respond to every Russian strike at Kherson, Nikopol, Kharkiv region, all our cities and communities. It is very tangible for them. I am grateful to all our energy workers, utility workers for stable energy supply and a minimum of outages - taking into account all the existing circumstances. Wherever transmission lines and other energy facilities are damaged by shelling, the restoration continues around the clock. Today as well. And it is very important how all Ukrainians recharged their inner energy this New Year's Eve. And how we thanked our warriors. How we thanked our loved ones. How millions of times all over Ukraine, all over the free world, our wish - the wish of victory - has sounded and still sounds. We will do everything to make it so! Glory to all our warriors! Glory to each and everyone who works for the victory of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! Only two days have passed since the beginning of the year, and the number of Iranian drones shot down over Ukraine is already more than eighty. This number may increase in the near future. Because these weeks the nights can be quite restless. We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack with \"Shaheds\". Its bet may be on exhaustion. On exhaustion of our people, our air defense, our energy sector. But we must ensure - and we will do everything for this - that this goal of terrorists fails like all the others. Today, I would like to mention the Air Commands \"Center\", \"South\" and \"East\" for the successful protection of the sky these days. And especially - the warriors of the 96th Kyiv, 208th Kherson and 138th Dnipro anti-aircraft missile brigades, the 301st Nikopol anti-aircraft missile regiment of the Air Forces, as well as the warriors of the 39th anti-aircraft missile regiment of the Ground Forces. Of course, I am grateful to our pilots, the pilots of our fighters and warriors of mobile firing groups. Now is the time when everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive. The Russian regime needs mobilizing emotions. Something that they want to demonstrate to their country in order to continue lying that everything is going \"according to the plan\". And our task is to give Ukraine every day successes, achievements, even small, yet victories over terrorists and terror. Each shot down drone, each shot down missile, each day with electricity for our people and minimal schedules of blackouts are exactly such victories. And every step forward of our servicemen at the front, every saved position is such successes that are of strategic importance now. We must increase the price of new mobilization and war in general for the terrorist state as much as possible. I am grateful to every warrior of ours who ensures this! I am grateful to everyone who stands near Bakhmut! I am grateful to everyone who despite everything holds positions in Soledar and other areas! Thank you for the Luhansk region, for the south! No matter how difficult it is now, we must endure it. For it to be easier at the end of this winter. Today I spoke with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. I am glad that the first international conversation in the new year was held with the head of the European Commission. We equally understand the challenges of this winter, this year for Ukraine and the whole of Europe. We have discussed financial support for our state - in January, we expect the first tranche of macro-financial aid, as was agreed upon last year. This is extremely important right now, when Russia is trying to gather new forces for aggression. We have also discussed the preparation of the Ukraine-EU Summit to be held in early February. I believe that at this summit, we will be able to outline the key new steps for this year for our common resilience, for our common victory.  Today, I held a special preparatory meeting with members of the NSDC and representatives of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Verkhovna Rada and the Office on global trends for Ukraine this year and in the future. I instructed to elaborate draft decisions of the NSDC for the internal transformation of our state to continue and for us to ensure security and leadership of Ukraine under any external conditions. I am grateful to everyone who will be on duty at combat posts tonight! I am grateful to all who are fighting for our native Ukraine! I am grateful to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! I have just finished a conversation with the Prime Minister of Canada, and this is the fourth international conversation today. The Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister of Norway. And now Justin Trudeau. We started this year with what Ukraine needs most right now - on the eve of new mobilization processes being prepared by the terrorist state. Now is the moment when together with our partners we must strengthen our defense. We have no doubt that the current masters of Russia will throw everything they have left and everyone they can muster to try to turn the tide of the war and at least postpone their defeat. We have to disrupt this Russian scenario. We are preparing for this. The terrorists must lose. Any attempt at their new offensive must fail. This will be the final defeat of the terrorist state. I thank all partners who understand this. Russia mobilizes those whom it wants to throw to death, we mobilize the civilized world. For the sake of life. I am grateful to Canada for its unwavering defense, sanction and financial support. Today we discussed with Prime Minister Trudeau how we can further increase pressure on Russia. I feel that Canadian assistance to our defense will remain strong this year. I thank Norway for the very powerful decisions that have already been taken and that are still being prepared. This applies to armed support as well - Norway's role can become truly historic in the defense of Europe if we implement everything we are talking about now. This also applies to the support of our energy system. In particular, I thank Norway for its readiness to help provide Ukraine with the necessary volume of gas for this winter. I am grateful to the UK for the fully concrete agreements reached, first of all in the defense sphere. Today, in the conversation with Prime Minister Sunak, I felt that we equally perceive the importance of this year, the prospects of this year. The fact that it is possible to achieve a pivotal advantage right now, not allowing Russia to win back on this or that front direction. I am grateful to the Netherlands for sharing with us the same understanding of justice, of how this war should end. Today I have informed Mr. Prime Minister Rutte on the nearest intentions of the enemy, on what Russia is preparing for the winter months and the beginning of spring. I am confident that Ukraine will be heard in Europe. And every day I will continue such diplomatic activity - both formal and informal, both public and non-public. This morning, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. A long one. There were reports from the Commander-in-Chief on the operational situation at the front, the head of intelligence - on what to expect from the enemy in the coming weeks and months. We determine the needs of Ukraine, our defense, our energy sector in great detail. And we are working to meet each of the needs, in particular with partners. And one more thing. Yesterday Russian terrorists destroyed the ice arena in Druzhkivka, Donetsk region. With a missile. This ice arena - \"Altair\" - started working before the war, when Donbas had a normal life before Russia came. Children trained there. There was a children's sports school. Hockey competitions were held there. People played sports there, celebrated and just enjoyed life. Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka, Bakhmut, Pokrovsk, Donetsk, Toretsk and other cities and villages of Donbas - everyone knew what kind of arena it was, and many people visited it. Last year it was used to collect and distribute humanitarian aid. The Russian missile against Altair in Druzhkivka is another confession of the terrorist state. It is a confession of what it came to Donbas with and what we will definitely oust from there. Death will not prevail in Donbas, and we must do everything to throw out its tricolor from Donbas and other lands of Ukraine. I thank everyone who fights and works for our victory! I thank everyone who helps protect life! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we have new and powerful results from our diplomatic marathon. France takes European defense support for Ukraine to a new level, and I thank President Macron for this leadership. We will receive more armored vehicles, in particular wheeled tanks of French production. This is what sends a clear signal to all our other partners: there is no rational reason why Ukraine has not yet been supplied with Western-type tanks. And this is very important to restore security for all Ukrainians and peace for all Europeans. Before the new \"Ramstein\" such signal is extremely relevant. We must put an end to the Russian aggression this year exactly and not postpone any of the defensive capabilities that can speed up the defeat of the terrorist state. Modern Western armored vehicles, Western-type tanks are just one of these key capabilities. I want to thank Denmark today after the conversation with Prime Minister Frederiksen. I informed her of the current situation on the frontline, that Russia is planning another wave of aggression for the coming months. We must make this wave the last one - no chance for revenge for terrorists. Today, I have heard strong support for Ukraine from Denmark, readiness to strengthen our positions in the fight against aggression together. And it is very important that this year Denmark will defend the security and interests of Europe and international law just as after February 24. I had a conversation with the President of Romania today. It was a meaningful and multifaceted conversation. I thanked Mr. President for the level of cooperation we achieved last year. This applies to political, defense and economic cooperation as well. We have done a lot together to protect the Black Sea region. I am confident that this year we will do even more. As I have already said, I will continue such diplomatic activity every day - this marathon of negotiations with the leaders of partner states and friends of Ukraine around the world. We are already responding and will respond very concretely and effectively to any new attempt of the aggressor to additionally mobilize and throw something more against Ukraine. Exactly with what is necessary on the battlefield and for the protection of the entire territory of our state. Each of our partners will have very specific information about our defense needs. And we all have the same goal: to put an end to Russian aggression as soon as possible, to restore reliable and lasting peace. We are discussing our initiative - our Peace Formula - with all leaders. These are ten clear points. All security elements, our territorial integrity, complete withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine and full guarantee of justice, that is, punishment of all those guilty of this aggression and crimes against Ukraine and Ukrainians, as well as compensation for all damages caused to Ukraine at the expense of the assets of the terrorist state. Today, I would like to praise our warriors in the Bakhmut direction, in particular, the special unit of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine \"Shaman\", as well as the border guards of the Luhansk detachment, who, together with the fighters of the International Legion of Defense of Ukraine, inflict numerous losses to the enemy and drive the occupants out of their positions on the outskirts of Bakhmut. This is a good result, and I am grateful for it. Each such result and each day of the enemy's failures in the Bakhmut direction and in Donbas in general is a significant weakening of the aggressor state. The occupants have been postponing the date when they expect to capture the entire Donbas for six months. They have been expecting to do it by the New Year - and our defenders are demonstrating success again. The invaders are constantly increasing their forces in the Donetsk region - they are doing it now as well. And every such day with our successes is a new proof of the insanity of the very idea to attack Ukraine. If only such news from the front can return a sense of reality to everyone in Russia, we will have to ensure it as much as possible. And we must understand how difficult and painful this task is. But it cannot be otherwise. Terrorists must lose despite everything they try to do to strengthen themselves. I am grateful to our defenders of the Bakhmut fortress! I am grateful to all our warriors who withstand the pressure in the Soledar direction and defend their positions! I am grateful, of course, to all our fighters who provide quite encouraging news from the Luhansk region and certain southern areas of our country! Thank you to all who fight for Ukraine! Thank you to all who help us! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! Today was another active diplomatic day - four more leaders of partner states were fully informed about Ukraine's defense needs and the nearest plans of the terrorist state. Russia will not be able to conceal in silence its preparations for a new wave of aggression against Ukraine and the whole of Europe. The world will know in all details - how and when the aggressor is preparing a new escalation in this war. And every new mobilization step of Russia will be known to the world even before Russia makes it. We will ensure this. And we strengthen the defense of Ukraine every day. I always discuss two things with all leaders - more defense support for our state, that is, more weapons for our army, and more protection for all Ukrainians - protection on the ground, in the sky and at sea. My conversation with Prime Minister of Croatia Plenković today was not only meaningful, as always, but also quite inspiring. I heard the full support for our state, as well as the readiness of Croatia to be a leader in the implementation of those steps that guarantee the return of security elements to Ukraine and Europe in general. Croatia is ready to be a leader in those efforts that are necessary to clear our land from Russian mines and unexploded shells. This is one of the vital tasks for our country and all Europeans. No part of Europe should be - and will not be - contaminated with mines, no matter how hard Russia tries to fill our land with its instruments of death. My today's conversation with the President of Latvia was also devoted to the path that our entire continent must take to ensure truly reliable security after the defeat of Russian aggression. We discussed the points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula - security, restoration of our territorial integrity and full force of the UN Charter, as well as the fair responsibility of Russia and all its murderers for the terror against Ukrainians. I would also like to mention the conversation with President of Türkiye Erdoğan - it concerned many elements of security in our Black Sea region. Of course, we talked about the necessary steps to ensure food security and what needs to be done for nuclear safety and prevention of any radiation incidents, the threat of which Russia has made, unfortunately, quite real. We also talked about the dynamics of the situation in our region - about the fact that the masters of Russia are now in a rather desperate situation due to the defeats of the occupiers at the front and are ready for various manipulations. I am grateful to President Erdoğan for supporting our state and the necessity of fair restoration of the security of Ukraine and the whole of Europe based on the restoration of our territorial integrity. My conversation with Prime Minister of Spain Sánchez was very meaningful and timely. On the eve of the new meeting in the Ramstein format, it is very important for each of our partners to know 100% the real situation on the frontline and what our Defense Forces are ready for. I thank Mr. Prime Minister Sánchez and all Spaniards for their unwavering support of our commitment to defend freedom. And today I would like to express separate gratitude to President Biden and Chancellor Scholz for the decision to strengthen our defense, a very important decision. We will have another Patriot battery and powerful armored vehicles - this is truly a great victory for our country. All details and terms will be announced tomorrow - after my conversation with Mr. Chancellor. Today, I also held a meeting of the Staff devoted primarily to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and all our defense and security forces. We understand that we must use the nearest time - January and the beginning of February - to be ready for any attempts of terrorists to use new mobilization resources of Russia. Today, I would like to commend our fighters of the 54th separate mechanized brigade who have been successfully holding positions in the Bakhmut direction for many months. And also - the fighters of the 35th marine brigade for the gradual, step by step liberation of our territories in the Donetsk direction. Thank you, warriors! I am grateful to each and everyone who provides us with the much needed resilience and progress in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions! And one more thing I want to remind the citizens of Russia today. On November 15, the Ukrainian Peace Formula was presented. One of its points provides for the withdrawal of Russian occupation troops from the territory of our country. This is a guaranteed and reliable way to cease fire, stop casualties and war in general. As of the morning of the same day, the number of Russian soldiers killed was 82,000. On December 12, Russia received an offer to begin implementation of the Peace Formula with the withdrawal of occupation troops just on Christmas Day. As of that day already, the number of Russian soldiers killed was almost 95,000. Apparently both of our proposals have not been heard by the leaders of your country... In the place where they are, apparently, it is too deep to hear. As of today, you have already lost almost 110,000 of your soldiers killed in this war. Those who continued the terror against our country and sent all those people of yours to the slaughter, rejecting our offers to stop the Russian aggression, certainly do not value life and definitely do not seek peace. Now they want to use Christmas as a cover to at least briefly stop the advance of our guys in Donbas and bring equipment, ammunition and mobilized men closer to our positions. What will this bring? Just another increase in the death toll. Everyone in the world knows how the Kremlin uses respites at war to continue the war with renewed vigor. But to end the war faster, that is not what is needed at all. What is needed is the citizens of Russia who will find the courage to free themselves of their shameful fear of one man in the Kremlin, at least for 36 hours, at least at Christmas time.  Your fear of him destroys your country, which is also already deep... But not in a bunker. To end the war is to end your state's aggression. Even when your missiles and drones are not hitting our cities, the terror in the occupied territories continues. You don't give Ukrainians any respite. People are tortured, electrocuted, raped. This continues every day while your soldiers are on our soil. And the war will be over when your soldiers either leave or we drive them out. So, let them take the toilet bowls - they'll need them on the road - and go back home. Behind our border of 1991. I thank everyone who helps our people defend freedom! I thank everyone who fights and works to defeat terrorists! Glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear people! My sincere congratulations to millions of Ukrainian families who gather together today to spend Christmas Eve and meet the first star. It announces the birth of Christ. This is a holiday of harmony and family unity. And together we are all a big Ukrainian family. And no matter where we are now - at home, at work, in a trench, on the road, in Ukraine or abroad - our family is united as never before. In its courage, steadfastness, mutual respect and mutual assistance. United in its belief in a single victory. We are bringing it closer together. Every day. Together we stand for each other, side by side. Every day. We protect our land, our culture, our traditions, our faith. As our ancestors Cossacks did - defenders of faith and the Church of Christ. And as it was done by all their descendants and successors of the traditions of our army and our people. Our ancestors believed that on Christmas Eve the souls of deceased relatives descend from heaven. As it is sung, to see those who were left on earth. Today the spirits of our ancestors help us every day. To fight those who came to our land. We live in special times. And all our holidays are special. And we have to break some of our traditions to protect our traditions. On holidays, you cannot wear dark or old, worn clothes so that trouble does not come to your home. But trouble came to our home on February 24, 2022, so since then we are not in white clothes and we are fighting against black forces. Guests should be treated with special friendliness and care. Guests, not occupiers. It is forbidden to clean and take out the garbage from the house on a holy day, but we’ve been fighting against devils and taking out the garbage from our house for more than 300 days in a row. It is forbidden to sew and knit, but we weave camouflage nets and sew bulletproof vests, overcoming evil. Our ancestors did not go hunting these days, but we fight so that we do not become prey and defeat the beast. God sees it. The world sees it. \"Carol of the Bells\", written to the music of Mykola Leontovych, is sung in more than 150 variations. Ukrainian \"Shchedryk\" brings Christmas spirit to the whole planet. The spirit of hope, goodness and miracle. This year, this spirit is brought to the world not only by our music, but also by Ukrainian courage, indomitability and invincibility. Our ancestors believed that heavens open on Christmas night. And if at this time you ask the higher powers about your dream, it will certainly come true. Today we all have one dream. May harmony come to every family, welfare to every home, victory to the Ukrainian land, and with it – peace and prosperity for thousands of years. I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a delicious kutia! Take care of yourself, take care of your families, take care of our Ukraine! Christ is being Born! Glorify Him!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Finally, we can say that we have managed to bring Ukraine's strength and defense cooperation with partners to a new level. The one we really need right now. Now, our soldiers will have even more weapons, equipment, rounds, defense systems, which will make us much more prepared for any escalating plans of Russia and those strikes that the terrorist state inflicts, regardless of whether it is a holiday or a weekday. I thank everyone who helps us protect our country and Ukrainians! Since I visited the United States two weeks ago, there have already been more than 20 stages in our diplomatic marathon. It's my communication with the leaders of Germany, Sweden, Japan, Croatia, Spain, Latvia, Turkey, France, Denmark, Romania, Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Israel, Greece and India. In addition, my first negotiations this year with the President of the European Commission. Also constant contact with US representatives. For example, today a delegation of the Senate was in Kyiv, and also a conversation between the defense minister of Ukraine and the secretary of defense of the United States was held. And today, a new package of US defense assistance for our country was announced – and a very powerful one! For the first time, we will get Bradley fighting vehicles – this is exactly what is needed. New guns and projectiles, including high-precision ones. New missiles. New drones. It's timely and strong. The total amount of this support package from the United States is almost $3 billion. I thank President Biden, I thank the congressmen and all Americans who value freedom, and who know that freedom is worth protecting, and who heard Ukraine during my visit to Washington. We see absolutely concrete results of this visit and our negotiations. We now have a significant step forward by Germany to strengthen the security of not only Ukraine but also the whole of Europe, especially the entire region bordering Russia. Strengthening our air defenses is a direct de-escalation effort here and now. The fewer opportunities Russia has to terrorize peaceful cities, the less the overall potential of Russian aggression will be. I thank Chancellor Scholz for the decision to provide Ukraine with the Patriot air defense system! Together with the brilliant German IRIS-T, the Patriot system will make Ukrainian and European skies much safer. Also today, with Mr. Chancellor, we discussed other aspects of our defense cooperation, in particular, 40 Marder vehicles and other things that are necessary to stop Russian aggression. A very important talk was held today with Prime Minister of Japan Kishida. Last year, Japan became a leader among Asian countries in the protection of freedom and international law. I am sure that this year too – especially with Japan's chairmanship of the Group of Seven, which began in January – we will be able to do even more together for our common security. Actually, today we agreed on priorities for cooperation this year. And I thank Mr. Prime Minister for a very serious package of energy assistance – powerful generators for our country and people. Today's conversation with the Prime Minister of Sweden can also be called strategic. The Swedish Presidency of the Council of the European Union has now begun, and we expect to begin negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union during the Swedish presidency. It's an important motivational element for Ukraine and all Europeans. Despite any attempts by Russia to destabilize Europe, together we become even stronger in all aspects, including institutional ones. So, as of now, for Ukraine, there is more air defense, more armored vehicles, for the first time – Western tanks, more guns and rounds, more energy and political opportunities. And all this means more protection for Ukrainians and all Europeans from any manifestations of Russian terror. Ruscism must lose this war – in everything and everywhere. On land, in the sky, on the sea, in energy, in the economy, in politics, and finally – on the dock in the international tribunal for this aggression against Ukraine. Every day, together with our partners, we bring this sentence for terrorists closer. Peace is getting closer every day. I will continue our diplomatic marathon next week. Let's make Ukraine even stronger! I thank everyone who defends our country! Thanks to everyone who keeps Bakhmut and Donetsk region! To everyone who is moving forward in Luhansk region! To all who hold the south! To all who defend our sky! Dear Ukrainians! Please remember what evil is at war against us. Pay attention to the air raid alerts, and especially during these holidays. Our air defense fighters will do everything possible. But please help them by taking care of your own safety. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Once again, I wish everyone who celebrates today, on this day, which has already become historic for Ukraine, for the spiritual independence of our people, a Merry Christmas. I was glad today to see how many people, how many of our soldiers attended the service in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra – in that holy place, which is one of the origins of the Ukrainian cultural tradition. It's very important that a sincere prayer for Ukraine was today and will continue to be heard in the Lavra. And that no one will make Ukrainian a stranger in the laurel. Ukrainian independence must be strong in all its elements. And it will be like that. Forever. We're bringing it ourselves. And it's very important to continue staying in the mood that was felt today. The joy of strengthening Ukraine and achieving historical justice. I wish all Ukrainian men and women that you and I have this mood more often. Today, I signed the decrees on the implementation of the decisions of the National Security and Defense Council – a new meeting was held. First, we approved the general action plan of the National Security and Defense Council for this year. It will certainly be no less forceful than in previous years, and the key priority is to ensure our independence and strengthen our ability to defend ourselves – making all the steps required, using all the means that will work. Secondly, we have an intermediate result in the work regarding many citizens of Russia and persons associated with it who justify the war, help to wage it, or glorify the terrorist state. Today, there is the first such sanctions list – there will be further decisions on sanctions against such persons. Everyone whose voice sounds in unison with the roar of Russian artillery will be isolated from the civilized world. And, by the way, the world was once again able to see today how false any words of any level that sound from Moscow are. They said something there about an alleged ceasefire… But the reality is that Russian rounds hit Bakhmut and other Ukrainian positions again. It has been confirmed once again: only the expulsion of the Russian occupiers from Ukrainian land and the elimination of any opportunities for Russia to put pressure on Ukraine and the whole of Europe will mean the restoration of the ceasefire, security and peace. It's what we are working for, it's exactly what the help of our partners is aimed at, and it's exactly what the entire civilized world has now. And I thank everyone who helps us defend the independence of Ukraine! Thanks to everyone who fights and works for our country! Today we are one step closer to our victory. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, the first liberation of our warriors from Russian captivity took place this year. 50 Ukrainians returned home. 33 officers, 17 - privates and sergeants. Among them are defenders of the Kyiv and Donetsk regions, Mariupol and the south of the country. Soldiers of the army, National Guard, territorial defense, navy, border guards. Our team works without a single break to free Ukrainians. Today I want to thank them once again: Budanov, Yermak, Malyuk, Usov, Lubinets and others. I am especially grateful to those of our units who replenish the exchange fund. Everyone who captures the enemy on our land, gives an opportunity to return freedom to some Ukrainians. I would also like to note the success of our Air Forces. Since the beginning of this day, three helicopters and also drones have been shot down. Well done, guys! Thank you for the consistent demilitarization of the aggressor state. The situation on the frontline has not changed significantly in the first week of the year. Heavy fighting continues in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions - every hotspot in these areas is well known. Bakhmut is holding out against all odds. And although most of the city is destroyed by Russian strikes, our warriors repel constant attempts at Russian offensive there. Soledar is holding out. Although there is even more destruction there and it is extremely hard... There is no such piece of land near these two cities, where the occupier would not have given his life for the crazy ideas of the masters of the Russian regime. This is one of the bloodiest places on the frontline. Today, commander of the direction, General Syrskyi, visited the troops defending the outskirts of Bakhmut and Soledar.  He awarded the warriors for their resilience. On the spot, he organized the steps necessary to strengthen our defense. In particular, transfer of additional units. And intensification of fire on the invaders. We should understand that all our positions, all our actions in defense are interconnected, and the resilience and effectiveness of actions at the front in general depends on the resilience and effectiveness of actions at each point of the front. I thank all our defenders who act in this way, who realize that their personal resilience, their personal strength and effectiveness give resilience, strength and effectiveness to the whole state. We defend the whole state, wherever the battles for it take place. We are preparing for diplomatic events that we have planned for this week. We expect good news for our country, good decisions that will further strengthen the defense. The world has seen again these days that Russia lies even when it draws attention to the situation at the front with its own statements. Russian shelling of Kherson with incendiary ammunition right after Christmas. Strikes on Kramatorsk and other cities of Donbas - exactly on civilian objects and exactly when Moscow reported on the alleged \"silence\" of their army. More threats of Russian officials to Europe and the world… All this was when Moscow was talking about the alleged \"truce\". No attempt by Russia to manipulate diplomacy and politics will ever work again. Only the strengthening of Ukraine, only the successes of Ukraine, only the restoration of territorial integrity of Ukraine, only the return of all our people from Russian captivity are the guarantees of peace. We are bringing it closer every day. Glory to all who fight and work for the victory of our state! Glory to all who help our state! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for our state and our independence! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! Today, I have held a regular meeting of the Staff. The main attention was paid to the situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - those areas that are the hottest now. Bakhmut and Soledar, Kreminna and Svatove, overall prospects in Donbas for the coming weeks. The battle for Donbas continues. And although the invaders have now concentrated their greatest efforts on Soledar, the result of this difficult and long battle will be the liberation of our entire Donbas. I thank all our warriors who defend our Bakhmut and demonstrate maximum resilience! I thank all the warriors in Soledar who withstand new and even tougher attacks of the occupiers! It is extremely difficult - there are almost no whole walls left... Due to the resilience of our warriors there, in Soledar, we have gained additional time and additional power for Ukraine. And what did Russia want to gain there? Everything is completely destroyed, there is almost no life left. And thousands of their people were lost: the whole land near Soledar is covered with the corpses of the occupiers and scars from the strikes. This is what madness looks like. I thank all our defenders for every step forward in other areas on the frontline, for gradual advancement - very careful, calculated and therefore absolutely reliable. Today, the Commander-in-Chief, commanders, chief of intelligence reported to the Staff... We integrate into our defense system new combat means and equipment that we receive from our partners. We do everything to ensure that there is as little time as possible between the agreement on additional support and the application of this support on the battlefield. Today, I held four more stages of negotiations with partners - we continue our diplomatic marathon, which began last year with a visit to Washington. During this day - Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, President of Slovenia, Prime Minister of Portugal, Prime Minister of North Macedonia. I spoke to all of them about the increase of defense support for our state, the necessity to bring Russian aggression to defeat this year and the implementation of all elements of our peace formula - from the restoration of territorial integrity of Ukraine to the punishment of terrorists for their actions. There will be good news for our state, and it is very important that we reach an agreement with our partners right now, on the eve of the new \"Ramstein\", and against the background of new brutal crimes of the occupiers. Russian strikes on Kherson and Ochakiv, cities of the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions, constant terror against border communities of the Sumy region... Constant terror against our people in the occupied territory... The world knows that every day of Russian presence on Ukrainian soil means deaths, injuries, pain and suffering of people. Ukraine must get everything it needs to expel terrorists from our land and to reliably protect our people from any Russian escalation plans. I am sure that our warriors will have these weapons and equipment at the front. Very soon. Today, I met with the Executive Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for the European Green Deal - for the renewal of European energy life on the basis of modern \"green\" energy. Such renewal is our goal as well, and it is a security goal. Modern and \"green\" energy for Ukraine, the use of renewable energy sources will significantly strengthen our resilience against any aggressive ambitions of Russia aimed at our and European energy sector. We are also preparing for important events in our political relations with the European Union - for the EU-Ukraine Summit, for further institutional rapprochement of our state, our state system and the EU system, as well as for the beginning of membership negotiations. This is one of our most important tasks. I am grateful to everyone who brings the implementation of this task closer with their work. I thank each and everyone who helps our country! Glory to everyone who works for the victory of Ukrainians! Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Tonight, I have signed decrees awarding our warriors. 573 warriors were awarded state awards. 283 of them - posthumously. Eternal memory to each and every one who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is a new stage of our diplomatic marathon. Four more conversations with European leaders: President of the European Council, Prime Minister of Belgium, President of Estonia and Prime Minister of Ireland. I informed them about the situation on the battlefield - about the difficult situation in the Donetsk region, about the constant Russian attacks and the fact that Russia does not count its people, does not spare the locals and does not stop before any criminal actions. This can - and must! - be countered only by a new level of modern military equipment that Ukraine can receive from partners. I thank all the leaders who help us for understanding that now is the time for new powerful decisions, for new powerful support. The free world has everything necessary to stop Russian aggression and bring the terrorist state to a historic defeat. And it is important not only for us. It is important for global democracy, for all those who value freedom. It is even more important now, when Russia is gathering forces for another escalation. Together with our partners, we must do - and we are doing! - everything to make it clear to Russia's masters that no escalation will help them. The defeat of the Russian aggression must remain unalterable, no matter who and what Russia tries to throw into the battle. I am grateful to the President of the European Council for understanding how important it is to maintain the unwavering support of Ukraine. In this confrontation, in which Russia is trying to exhaust all of us - Ukrainians, Europeans, other partners - there must be clarity of signals. Signals that we will go all the way to the defeat of Russian terror. We will go together and with the preservation of stability in Ukraine - financial and social. And that is why financial support was one of the main topics of my conversation with Charles Michel, as well as weapons and further European integration of Ukraine. I thank the Prime Minister of Belgium for supporting our diplomatic efforts, in particular our Peace Formula, all its fundamental elements: restoration of security, restoration of our territorial integrity, restoration of justice. I am confident that the leadership of Belgium will help us achieve a fair peace. And I am thankful for the willingness to really bring peace closer by increasing the armed support for our state. The already provided Belgian defense assistance has significantly strengthened our state, and we agreed today that our teams would work on a new supply. I am grateful to the President of Estonia and all Estonians for new decisions to strengthen our defense. We have also discussed with Mr. President our further steps in the European and Euro-Atlantic integration. I thank Estonia for a very strong representation of Ukraine's interests in Europe. Even when someone doubts, Estonia finds arguments to support Ukraine and to increase sanction pressure on Russia. I am grateful to the new Prime Minister of Ireland for the willingness to continue the course of Ireland's comprehensive support for Ukraine. We have agreed on a powerful energy support. And I thanked Ireland for freezing Russian assets - we will work together to ensure that these funds are used for the restoration of Ukraine. In general, since my visit to Washington, I have already held about thirty talks with leaders and representatives of partner states. And I literally feel every day how the world's determination to overcome Russian aggression is growing. I thank everyone who helps us defend Ukraine and freedom! I thank everyone who fights for independence! Today, I would like to pay special tribute to the warriors of the 46th separate airmobile brigade for their bravery and steadfastness in the defense of Soledar! Thank you, warriors! I thank everyone who works to strengthen Ukraine! And one more thing. Based on the materials prepared by the Security Service of Ukraine and the State Migration Service of Ukraine, and in accordance with the Constitution of our state, I have decided to terminate the citizenship of four persons: Andriy Leonidovych Derkach, Taras Romanovych Kozak, Renat Raveliyovych Kuzmin and Viktor Volodymyrovych Medvedchuk. If people's deputies choose to serve not the people of Ukraine, but the murderers who came to Ukraine, our actions will be appropriate. And these are not the last such decisions. The services are working. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I wish you health, dear Ukrainians!Today, here in Lviv, important news for Ukraine was announced during the Summit of the Lublin Triangle, our special format with Poland and Lithuania. Poland has decided to provide tanks for Ukraine - I am grateful for this. I thank President Duda, the Government of Poland, all our Polish friends. Lithuania provides anti-aircraft systems to our country - the weapons we need to protect ourselves from Iranian drones - to protect our energy sector. I thank Gitanas for another demonstration of unwavering and principled support for Ukraine, which began even before February 24 and will continue until our victory. Today, I heard this confidence once again from both Andrzej and Gitanas - we will go all the way together to restore security of Ukraine and the whole of Europe, to restore our territorial integrity, to restore peace. Russian aggression must fail - and it will. Today, we have discussed the issue of our integration into the EU and NATO in a very meaningful way. This year, we must achieve tangible progress in European integration. This concerns, first of all, the start of negotiations on membership. Poland and Lithuania are equally and comprehensively ready to support us, see us fully integrated into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Together with our other partners on the continent and in the Alliance, we have to transform this readiness, this energy into real institutional movement, into real decisions. Of course, today we also talked about the situation on the battlefield. In particular, that Russian aggression will be depleted only when Russian ambitions have no other alternative except for the defeat. All Russian ambitions - on the front, in politics, in economy, in the legal sphere. Now the terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend that some part of our city of Soledar - a city that was almost completely destroyed by the occupiers - is allegedly some kind of Russia’s achievement. They will present – and are already presenting – this to their society in such a way as to support mobilization and to give hope to those who support aggression. But the fighting continues. The Donetsk direction is holding out. And we do everything, without stopping for a single day, to strengthen Ukrainian defense. Our potential is growing. And I thank all our partners who help in this. Western-type tanks are the work of our entire anti-war coalition and this is a new level of our potential. Today, in Lviv, I also held a meeting on the security situation in our western regions and on our state border. We take into account all threats, strengthen all elements of the security of our regions. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! I thank everyone who works for our victory! I thank everyone who helps us restore security! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. The meeting, which by its nature corresponded to the situation on the frontline, in the most important directions. Of course, the top issue is Soledar, Bakhmut, the struggle for the Donetsk direction in general. We have analyzed in detail what decisions are needed, what reinforcements are needed, what steps should be taken by commanders in the coming days. We also discussed the situation with the supply of weapons and ammunition to the troops, relevant interaction with our partners. Today, I talked about the prospects of the coming weeks and months with the Speaker of the Latvian Saeima, who was on a visit to Kyiv. We discussed not only defense, but also political prospects. In particular, European and Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine. I heard confidence that the day will definitely come when the Ukrainian flag will be absolutely on par with all flags of the EU member states. Latvia will help us in this. By the way, Latvia is one of those countries whose support for Ukraine in terms of percentage of GDP is one of the largest over the past year. I think that this trend may continue this year. Today, I continued phone talks with the leaders of the partner-states. Two more European countries whose voice is extremely important for Ukraine are Cyprus and Luxembourg. We are also expanding the geography of the diplomatic marathon - I spoke today with Mr. President of Kenya. All these negotiations are devoted to the security issues of both our state and our partners. I am grateful for the support of the Ukrainian Peace Formula and for the willingness to work together with us to put an end to Russian aggression as soon as possible. A very important initiative of Ukraine is the creation of food hubs in Africa. Our foreign policy should reach a new level with African partners. They have already felt that the security of different nations directly depends on Ukrainian food exports. And we want to consolidate this at the level of specific institutions, specific objects - hubs, that is, specific guarantees of food stability that will be constantly in effect and will be one of the new foundations of relations between Ukraine and the states of the African continent. Today we also opened a new direction in our state charity platform United24. This direction is the reconstruction of Ukraine. It is the generation of funds for the restoration, in particular, of housing for Ukrainians in the territories affected by Russian strikes and occupation. As of this day, about half a billion hryvnias have already been raised through United24 from people from more than a hundred countries to restore housing. This is a tangible help to both local communities and the state. In general, more than 10 billion hryvnias have already been raised due to the state fundraising platform. And I thank everyone who joined the United24 fundraising. Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine! Thank you to each and everyone who fights for Ukraine! And today, I want to especially mention the paratroopers of the 77th separate airmobile brigade, who together with the fighters of the 46th separate airmobile brigade in Soledar hold their positions and inflict significant losses on the enemy. Thank you, guys! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you very much! Dear friends! Gitanas, Mr. President! Madam First Lady Diana! Madam Speaker! Madam Prime Minister! Mrs. Paulė Kuzmickienė, thank you very much for your words! Ladies and gentlemen deputies of the Seimas! All attendees! Dear Lithuanian people! I am glad to greet you and I want to thank you at once for not betraying freedom for a single minute. And not only during these 323 days of cruel, inhuman Russian war - when we constantly feel your support. But for many years - when the free hearts of Lithuanians and the Lithuanian path to a united Europe inspired many people in different countries once enslaved by Russia. Lithuania is and, I am sure, will continue to be one of the most sincere defenders of freedom. And this is the best way to honor the memory and feat of the heroes who defeated the empire on those winter days 32 years ago. Your people did not just defend the buildings of the TV center, parliament and others. You defended your historical choice. Now we are also heading to victory. To the final victory over that empire. Russia will no longer be able to dictate anything to the peoples of Europe when we end this war with the unequivocal defeat of the aggressor. Remember February last year. Remember the offensive of Russian troops on Kyiv, Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv. It was much more than Russia's attempt to seize our territory. Encroaching on our cities, they meant the cities of other independent states of Europe as well. Attacking Kyiv, they dreamed of attacking Vilnius. And Riga, and Warsaw, and Prague, and Chișinău. They wanted our freedom to fall. But it is they who will fall. And now they have less and less such dreams. They are losing the power they boasted about. They are only talking about whether they will manage not to lose. However, this is not enough. We must make sure that no aggressor will ever have the opportunity to dream of something similar and encroach on our freedom. This is what we are fighting for. This is why our victory must be unequivocal now. The one that cannot be confused with anything. The one that will not be forgotten in Russia. The one that cannot be manipulated. The aggressor must be defeated. On the Ukrainian land where he came. So that it won’t be necessary to fight on the lands of other European nations later. And now - so that Russia does not get a break, does not have time to adapt and cannot restore its strength. This year is crucial. Back then, when your people had to defend their national life against Soviet revenge, it was impossible to protract it in time. It was necessary to act here, to act now - to defend yourselves. Your people have done so. Lithuanian hearts were fully mobilized. And this was the key to your victory at that time. Now we need even greater mobilization - in the whole free world. This is the only way to put an end to full-scale aggression. Total terror. The energy of the struggling world must not diminish. And I thank you for being ready to help us with this. I am sure, and I was convinced of this the day before yesterday when I spoke with Gitanas, with Mr. President, in Lviv. We need urgent decisions by our entire anti-war coalition. New defensive decisions that will give Ukrainian warriors the opportunity to drive the Russian army out of our land. And this concerns, first of all, modern tanks and effective artillery. We need new sanction decisions that will maintain constant and irresistible pressure on the aggressor state and on all economic actors that ensure the continuation of aggression. And we need an international tribunal, which will bring to justice those whose evil minds gave birth to this crime, this war. When the revanchists from present-day Moscow will face a fair trial, it will be a historic punishment for those revanchists who tried to break our freedom a generation ago. Dear friends! This day - Freedom Defenders Day - is the right time to remind that freedom is alive when the idea of its protection is alive. When there are people willing to fight for it. And when it is not just rhetoric, but real actions. Actions that Ukraine sees from Lithuania invariably. Actions that help us liberate our cities and villages from Russian occupation. Actions that help us protect our people from Russian missiles and bombs - I want to thank you, Gitanas, I thank you and the entire Lithuanian people for the air defense equipment provided to us - from the first day to this day. And also these are actions that bring closer the full integration of Ukraine and the institutions of the United, free, peaceful Europe. And we are looking forward to the NATO Summit in Vilnius. We know that it can become fateful for our entire Euro-Atlantic community. We will do everything to make it so. And we will do it together! Because history is always the achievement of the free. Thank you, friends! Thank you for this honorary award for all Ukrainians who are fighting for freedom! I believe that we will win! I know that we will win! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Several more stages of our diplomatic marathon took place today. I spoke with Mrs. Čaputová, the President of Slovakia. About details of our defense cooperation and the diplomatic steps we have planned with the Europeans for the near future. Thank you to Slovakia for supporting the interests of Ukraine and the whole of Europe. I also held talks with the Prime Minister of Albania, Rama. As always, I heard an understanding of our needs, an understanding of the Ukrainian position. In general, thanks to the negotiations this week, we managed to significantly strengthen the resoluteness of our partners to increase the supply of weapons to Ukraine. And we are working as hard as possible to ensure that it's reflected in the decisions of the next meeting at Ramstein Air Base, the meeting of defense ministers, which will take place in the second half of January. We are also preparing for Ukraine's participation in the events of the World Economic Forum in Davos. This year, the traditional economic topics of the forum will obviously give way to security issues. And it's important for us that there is an effective and clear Ukrainian answer to every question of the world regarding security. So be it. I took part in a special solemn meeting of the Lithuanian Seimas. Lithuania celebrated the Day of the Defenders of Freedom – the anniversary of the events of January 1991, when people defended the independence of their state against the efforts of then Moscow to maintain control over Lithuania. And today there was a very symbolic meeting, very emotional. I thanked our Lithuanian brothers for all their actions in support of Ukraine and our struggle for freedom and for all their words about the heroism of our people, which were and will be heard in Lithuania. Today, one of our greatest achievements in the time since February 24 was very clearly felt, namely: the context of European freedom, the context of the integrity of the European Union is simply impossible to imagine now without Ukraine. The fullness of Europe is, in particular, the fullness of integration with Ukraine. We will do everything to implement it in concrete decisions of the European community. Of course, today, as every day, we are constantly in touch with our commanders, with the heads of intelligence and special services. The tough battle for Donetsk region continues, the battle for Bakhmut and Soledar, for Kreminna, for other towns and villages in the east of our country continues. Although the enemy has concentrated its greatest forces in this direction, our troops – the Armed Forces of Ukraine, all defense and security forces – are defending the state. I thank every soldier, sergeant, officer of brigades and other army units who are bravely and staunchly performing their tasks! I thank the fighters of the Kraken unit for their decisive actions to destroy the enemy near Soledar! Thanks to the soldiers of the International Legion of the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense and the Shaman unit, who are bravely defending Bakhmut! Three hundred twenty-four days of the full-scale war, and how things have changed for Russia... They are already gnawing among themselves over who should be credited with some tactical advance. It's a clear signal of failure for the enemy. And it's another incentive for all of us to put more pressure on the occupier and to inflict heavier losses on the enemy. Thanks to everyone who makes it happen both on the front lines and all our other fronts. That is why today I also want to mark the employees of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Those whose work is usually completely invisible. And about whom few people talk. But they really bring closer very important decisions of partners for Ukraine, for our defenders. Thanks for that! I thank all the personnel of the Security Service of Ukraine, whose results in the fight, in particular, against collaborators and saboteurs, society sees. Every step of the state in national defense is carefully prepared, and this gives us legal and fair results. This gives us a real increase in our independence, in all its aspects. Thank you for that! Thanks to everyone who works for the victory of our country! Glory to our soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "I will begin this address without a greeting. And I want to be heard by those people – not only political leaders – who are still hesitating whether it is worth providing Ukraine with the weapons that will help us defeat the terrorist state this year. Russia has launched another heavy missile attack on Ukrainian cities. Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Kryvy Rih, Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Ladyzhyn, Burshtyn, Lviv region, Khmelnytsky and other cities were targets of terrorists. Civilian objects are everywhere! In the city of Dnipro, a residential building has been destroyed in this Russian strike. An ordinary nine-story panel building, of which there are quite a few in various cities of Eastern and Central Europe. All floors of this building – from the second to the ninth – were smashed in the explosion of a Russian missile. It was possible to save dozens of people – wounded, traumatized, treatment is being provided to them. Among them are children, the youngest girl is three years old. And these are figures for now. Debris clearance is still ongoing and will continue throughout the night. It's not yet known how many people are under the rubble. Unfortunately, the death toll is growing every hour... My condolences to relatives and friends. Can Russian terror be stopped? Yes. Is it possible to do it somehow differently than on the battlefield in Ukraine? Unfortunately no. This can and must be done on our land, in our sky, in our sea. What is needed for this? Those weapons that are in the warehouses of our partners and that our troops are so waiting for. No amount of persuasion or just passing the time will stop the terrorists who are methodically killing our people with missiles, drones bought in Iran, their own artillery, tanks and mortars. The whole world knows what can stop and how it's possible to stop those who sow death. This apartment block in Dnipro was on a street called Naberezhna Peremohy. When they gave this name to this street, they had in mind the victory over the Nazis in the Second World War. Ruscists took over everything from that enemy of the free world. It's obvious. And we must do everything we can to stop ruscism, just as the free world once stopped Nazism. And I thank everyone who helps us in this! I spoke today with the Prime Minister of the UK about some very important things for our defense. Details will come later. But it's important. It's really what is needed. And I believe that similar decisions will still be made by other partners – those who understand why such evil cannot be given a single chance. Because such evil knows no boundaries. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by ruscism! Glory to all who defend people! All services are now working in the sites hit by Russian missiles. Let's fight for every person! Out of more than 30 missiles launched towards Ukraine during the day, more than 20 were shot down. These are hundreds of saved lives. I thank our Air Force, our airmen and everyone who helps. Unfortunately, energy infrastructure facilities have been also hit. In this regard, the most difficult situation is in Kharkiv region and Kyiv region. Repair crews are doing their best to restore power generation and supply as soon as possible, and work will continue around the clock. And the enemy will receive our answer on the battlefield for sure. Our soldiers will do that. Anyone involved in this and other missile strikes against Ukraine will be found and brought to justice. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Fellow Ukrainians! Today I have been receiving reports from Dnipro all day. The debris is being cleared there. All necessary services are involved. Thanks to everyone who is carrying out the rescue operation! I thank the State Emergency Service, the police and the National Guard. I want to thank the utility services, our doctors, all volunteers, ordinary citizens of Dnipro who are helping! As of now, the fate of more than 30 people who could have been in the house at the time of the terrorists' missile hit remains unknown. Dozens of people were rescued from the rubble, including six children. We are fighting for every person! The rescue operation will last as long as there is even the slightest chance to save lives. Currently, the list of the dead includes 30 people, including one child - a girl, she was 15 years old. There are reports that two children lost their parents. My condolences to all those who lost their loved ones... Since the attack, Ukraine has heard words of condolences and support from many leaders, public figures, journalists and ordinary people from around the world. I thank everyone who did not remain indifferent! It is very important that normal people unite in response to terror. But... I want to say to all those in Russia - and from Russia - who even now could not utter even a few words of condemnation of this terror... Even though they see and know everything perfectly well… Your cowardly silence, your attempt to \"wait out\" what is happening will only end with those same terrorists coming after you one day. Evil is very sensitive to cowardice. Evil always remembers those who fear it or try to bargain with it. And when it comes after you, there will be no one to protect you. I think it is right that today there is a decision to expand our sanctions against Russian citizens and other persons who help terror. Almost 200 - this list is carefully prepared, and behind each name there is a responsible motivation. Those who justify terror. Those who grease the Russian propaganda machine. Those who tried to sell Ukraine somewhere in Moscow. This public will face a full list of personal restrictions. We will do everything to make the sanctions work on the largest possible scale - in Europe, in the world. Everyone will be held to account for terror: both those who kill and those who help to kill. The work of the NSDC on the sanctions lists continues, and the next decisions will be made soon. Today, as always, I want to thank our warriors. All those who heroically and steadfastly perform combat missions. Those who hold our positions. And especially in the most difficult areas of the front. The battle for Soledar, for Bakhmut, for the whole Donetsk region, for the Luhansk region continues without any respite, without any stop. I am grateful to each of our fighters, each of our soldiers, sergeants, officers who understand how important it is to destroy the invaders in this direction. Russia has made the battle for the cities of our Donbas fundamental for itself. Our heroes make this battle fundamental for the destruction of the combat potential of the terrorist state. Every day of Ukrainian resilience in Donbas and every success in our defense there are vital achievements for the protection of our entire state. And one more thing. Today a great friend of Ukraine, a legend - Vakhtang Kikabidze - passed away. We can talk a lot about him, and still there are not enough words to say all the good things that are worth saying about him. It is an honor for us that he was our friend. May his memory be bright! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Fellow Ukrainians! The debris of the house destroyed by the Russian missile is still being dismantled in Dnipro. I thank everyone who is carrying out this rescue operation! Every employee of the State Emergency Service and police, every doctor, every volunteer! Everyone who is involved! As of now, 39 people, including 6 children, have been rescued from under the rubble. In total, 47 reports were received about those who could have been in the house at the time of the strike and whose fate was unknown. The information about 22 people has been clarified. It is known about 40 dead, including 3 children. My condolences to all whose loved ones were killed by this strike! The Security Service of Ukraine has already started to gather information about those Russian military who prepared and carried out this strike. There is no doubt: every person guilty of this war crime will be identified and brought to justice. This strike at Dnipro, as well as other similar strikes, falls, in particular, under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. And we will use all available opportunities - both national and international - to ensure that all Russian murderers, everyone who gives and executes orders on missile terror against our people, face legal sentences. And to ensure that they serve their punishment. This is a fundamental task for Ukraine and for our partners. I thank everyone who supports our country on the path to justice. Today, by the way, I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte - he is one of those who help Ukraine the most, particularly in the issue of justice. It was our third conversation with Mr. Prime Minister in four weeks. I am grateful to Mark and all Dutch people for their continued support and clear understanding that Ukrainians must defeat Russian aggression. Today we discussed protection against Russian missiles and Iranian drones - we are doing everything to strengthen our air defense as much as possible. It is very important that our conversation took place on the eve of the visit of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands to the United States. What happened in Dnipro, the fact that Russia is preparing a new attempt to seize the initiative in the war, the fact that the nature of hostilities at the front requires new decisions in the defense supply - all this only emphasizes how important it is to coordinate our efforts - efforts  of all members of the coalition to defend Ukraine and freedom. And to speed up decision-making. Today, there is a good example from the UK. A new package of defense assistance has been announced - exactly what we need. Tanks, other armored vehicles, artillery. What we discussed with Prime Minister Sunak. I thank you, Rishi, I thank every Briton for the tangible and timely support! I held a regular meeting of the Staff. The questions are as follows. Interaction with our partners. Counteraction to missile terror. Possible scenarios of enemy actions and our response to each of the probable scenarios. There were reports of commanders, intelligence chiefs. There were also necessary decisions. The situation in the Donetsk direction was considered separately and in detail. Soledar, Bakhmut and other cities against which Russia has concentrated its last most prepared forces. We also reviewed the situation on the southern front. We see what Russia is preparing. Every day and night we work to reduce the enemy's potential: every day and night we subtract their warehouses, headquarters, communications. Today, the OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Macedonia visited Kyiv. Of course, we discussed first of all how to make the OSCE effective. This is one of those international organizations that have significant potential, but for various reasons in critical situations have a great lack of concrete actions, a great lack of determination. The OSCE can significantly increase attention and act accordingly regarding the deportation of our people from the occupied territory to Russia. And regarding the situation with Ukrainian prisoners. No international organization has found the strength to gain access to the places of detention of our prisoners in Russia yet. This must be corrected. I hope that the OSCE presidency of North Macedonia will contribute to this. Starting tomorrow, this week will be even more active in terms of our diplomacy. The Davos Forum will start its work - Ukraine will be heard at this globally important platform. At the end of the week, a regular meeting in the Ramstein format will be held. We expect fundamental decisions from the coalition of our partners. Important bilateral negotiations are also planned. Every day of our diplomatic marathon brings Ukraine quite specific defensive results. And I thank everyone who helps our state! I thank everyone who works for the victory of Ukraine! Glory to each of our warriors! Glory to all who have been fighting since February 24 and since 2014! This week, on January 20, we will mark the Day of Honoring the Defenders of the Donetsk airport. Today we have already started to recall that defense, that heroism of our people. The fight started in May 2014. The last defender left the DAP on January 23, 2015. And it was such a defense that the whole world should have seen back then already what Ukrainian invincibility means. I am confident that the Ukrainian flag will return to the Donetsk airport, Donetsk and other cities and villages of our Donbas and other temporarily occupied territories. Temporarily is the key word. Ukraine will return its people and what belongs to it. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear friends! I am grateful to you for those kind words about our people, our students and for everything that Germany does to support our country. Now the attention of many Ukrainians is focused on what is happening in our city of Dnipro. You have just spoken about it. A few hours ago, the rescue operation on the ruins of a house that was destroyed by a Russian missile was completed there. An ordinary residential building. Destroyed by an anti-ship missile - an aircraft carrier killer, which was developed back in the days of the Soviet Union. 44 people were killed. Including 4 children. Yesterday, a woman was rescued from the rubble - she spent 20 hours under the concrete, under the fallen slabs. She survived. But she lost her family... Her husband and child - a boy, he was only 11 months old - he could not be saved. And this is an unspeakable horror. And this is a routine. Unfortunately, this is the routine of the war that Russia brought to our land. Ukrainian cities and villages are subjected to such and similar attacks every day. Every day the news from the south of our country is about Russian indiscriminate shelling of the city of Kherson. Every day - shelling of the cities of Donbas and the east of Ukraine. Every day, the terror of border communities - those areas that are unlucky enough to border with Russia - they are shelled with mortars and artillery. I want you to understand Ukrainians - to understand what we are fighting against. We want to interrupt the routine of war. And restore the routine of peace. But we can do it only by winning the war. There is no other way. Most of you present here are very young people. You did not see the time when the Soviet rulers controlled a huge European space. In particular, part of Germany. However, the memory of that time - of how the Soviet empire existed and how it collapsed - is quite well worked out by historians and publicists. People know what happened. When the past is known, there is always a temptation to project that past onto the present. Especially when it comes to the actions of the same entity - the Kremlin. We have seen the attempts to integrate Moscow into the economic interdependence with Europe in the same way as it was done in the 1970s - 1980s of the XX century. Unfortunately, relations with Russia's neighbors have been viewed by some European politicians through the Russian optics for too long. For many years, the policy of European states - not all, but those with the greatest influence - has been based on the principle of caution towards Russian ambitions and dialogue with Russia - no matter what. This became political fertilizer for the audacity of Russian imperialism. For the confidence of the current master of the Kremlin that Europeans are allegedly weak. And that the missile legacy of the Soviet authorities allegedly outweighs international law, democracy, the strategic goal to unite Europe, namely the need to guarantee peace on our continent. Russia was wrong in its assessment of Ukraine and the whole of Europe. We haven't been taken aback. We have united. We have shown that Russia will never again control the European space and dictate to people how to live and what to value. Russia does not admit the mistake - and continues the war. But this is always the case with dictators. Democracies are stronger. Democracies can say that some previous policy was wrong. And that changes are needed. This is exactly what is happening now in Europe - in particular, thanks to German leadership. I am grateful to Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his determination to admit that the past is over. This Kremlin is not capable of being a partner in any variations of détente. It is impossible to coexist with it. Because it is impossible to coexist with terror. That is why Germany is becoming one of the leaders in supporting Ukraine - and we greatly appreciate it. We appreciate the assistance of your state both in protecting our skies from Russian missiles and in protecting social stability for our people. We appreciate the fact that German policy is being freed from Russian optics in relation to Ukraine and other countries-neighbors of Russia. But the page of European history, on which the Russian belief in the weakness of Europe is based, has not yet been turned. There is still a feeling in Moscow that it is possible to use threats or bribery to persuade European states to take the decisions Russia expects. I am sure that this page of history will be turned forever when we will be able to liberate our cities and villages from Russian terrorists with the help of German \"Leopards\", \"Marders\", \"Gepards\". This will be the time when Europe will be finally liberated from imperialism. It will be one decision - and how much fidelity to principles will be in it! Perhaps it will be the greatest in the history of Europe after the fall of the Soviet empire. Dear friends! I would like you to draw one conclusion from my words now. Exactly as students, as young people. As those who have to bring novelty to life, to your chosen professions. And this conclusion is to never be afraid to change the optics. To never be hostage to something that has become obsolete. To remain free, we must always rediscover what freedom is. To be strong, we must always see what mistakes were made. And to maintain leadership, we must always admit the reality. The Ukrainian reality now is that we can win this war. By the way, just today I spoke about this with Federal President Steinmeier. We can restore peace on our entire territory without leaving any pieces of land to the Kremlin for further experiments on people and history. But for this we must all be together - Ukraine, Germany and the whole free world. I believe that we will! Thank you for your attention! And I want to thank all university communities that are with us today! Thank you to all students and lecturers! Thank you - Madam President Professor von Blumenthal, and you - Madam President Professor Kocher! And special thank you to those who help the Ukrainian community in Germany and our students who study at your universities! I am waiting for your questions. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Fellow Ukrainians! Today the rescue operation in Dnipro has been completed. 79 people were wounded or injured by this Russian strike. The list of the dead includes 45 Ukrainians, including 6 children, including a boy who was only 11 months old… Children and civilians are enemies for Russia. Obviously, this could only happen because Russia has turned into an enemy of all mankind. I thank each and every person in the world who helps us to defend ourselves against terror! Today we heard very important news from Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. The news is actually a continuation of our recent negotiations with him. Ukraine will be provided with another Patriot battery. Thank you, Mark! That is, we already have three guaranteed batteries. But this is only the beginning. We are working on new decisions to strengthen our air defense. Today, I discussed defense cooperation with Federal President of Germany Steinmeier. We are actively preparing for a new meeting in the Ramstein format. We are preparing new important diplomatic steps - we also discussed them today. The annual forum in Davos, traditionally a powerful global political and economic platform, has started today. The world hears Ukraine in Davos - they know what Russia has done to Dnipro, they know what terrorists are doing to Kherson, Kharkiv, our Donbas and other territories Russia brought death to. And we are lobbying for increased global pressure on the terrorist state. I am confident that following this week, the world will see more active and influential supporters of the establishment of a Tribunal for Russian aggression and a special mechanism to compensate for the losses from the war at the expense of Russian assets. It is very important that the First Lady of Ukraine presented all the elements of our Peace Formula in Davos today, including the fundamental clause on justice, which envisages full liability of Russian terrorists for everything they have done. And the world's support for our diplomatic initiative is very much felt. We are doing everything to ensure that this support becomes truly global and that steps to end Russian aggression and return security are taken by all influential actors in international relations. Today, I held a meeting with the participation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine to identify the culprits of the attack on Dnipro. Every day there is more and more factual information and legal steps of our state. And all this will end with sentences for all these Russian murderers. I want to thank all the employees of the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies and all our partners, our intelligence, all special services that are working on the necessary materials for trials against rashists. I would like to thank all volunteers, public figures, especially journalists who are helping the investigation. And, of course, I thank all our warriors, each and every one of them who defends the state as part of all our defense and security forces, who is doing everything to oust the Russian army from Ukraine. First of all, I thank the warriors who are now at the front, who are fighting for our freedom, who are true heroes! When we oust the occupiers from our land, it will be a matter of time when justice will return, when sentences for Russian murderers will be pronounced. Glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russian aggression. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and gentlemen! Ten hours ago a tragedy happened near Kyiv. The helicopter crash claimed lives of the Minister of the Internal Affairs of Ukraine, his colleagues and helicopter crew when it fell near a kindergarten. Fourteen Ukrainian families lost their loved-ones today. And many more families are losing daily because of the war. And I shall ask you to honor the memory of every person Ukraine has lost with a minute of silence. Only one minute but it keeps the memory of so many people. Ukraine lives thousands of such minutes including three minutes on January 14. Three minutes – the time it took for the Russian missile to travel hundreds of kilometers, hit a residential block in Dnipro and kill at least forty-five people. My address will be short – about the time we are short of. About small minutes, about years made of these minutes. Three years ago, I spoke at Davos for the first time. In person. The topic was how to build a cohesive and sustainable world. I am talking online now. And the topic is how to cooperate in a divided, fragmented world. Conclusions? They are obvious: the world cannot keep the pace with changes and challenges. The list of crises – global security, environmental, food and energy ones – needs to be amended with another one: the time crisis. The list of calls for decisive, efficient joint actions needs to be expanded with one more: the call for speed. The speed of decision-making. Reaction of the civilized world. Tragedies are outpacing life. The tyranny is outpacing the democracy. Russia needed less than one second to start the war. The world needed days to react with first sanctions. The time the free world uses to think is used by the terrorist state to kill. Ukraine and its allies have been resisting it for almost a year. This period proved all our prompt actions brought positive results: the opening of European borders for Ukrainians; the grain deal; the energy unity. Together they saved millions of lives, not only in Ukraine. It is not only Ukraine – but the whole world needs exactly this pace of decisions and actions. The world was hesitant in 2014 when Russia without hesitation occupied Crimea. The world was hesitant in 2022 when Russia without hesitation made the war full-scale. The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revanche, the world needs resolve and speed. Russia is exporting terror. Russia is spreading the strain of war across the world. Ukraine offers the world a Peace formula. Please.Ten steps that the world must make faster than Russia makes its new moves. Mobilization of the world must outpace the next military mobilization of our joint enemy. The supplying of Ukraine with air defense systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supplies of Western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks. The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attack on security and peace in other countries. A tribunal for military crimes must prevent new ones. The expansion of NATO and the EU must outgo the spread of Russian aggression. We routinely defend values which some of the allies take for granted – as a fact of life. For us, the fact of life is the world in need of resolute and prompt steps. Ladies and gentlemen! Three years ago was my first time at the WEF. It was the time when the world was fighting Covid-19. It fought and won. Now the world is fighting against Putin. In three years, we will be discussing new challenges and threats in Davos. What will this mean? It will mean we will definitely overcome the current threat. The history repeats itself. At first, the world either fails to notice or underestimates a threat. Then it unites to resist it. And then the world wins. Every time the same outcome. The world overcame nazism, the apartheid, pandemics, the indifference to climate changes, financial crises, and the Kremlin strain. The world will overcome again. This is how much can be said in a matter of minutes. This is how much can be understood in a matter of minutes. The world will overcome again. The time is high to make it happen faster. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Another day of this terrible war, these tragedies that our people are going through, is coming to an end. A terrible day that we must go through, must endure. And we will endure. The rescue operation lasted almost nine hours in Brovary, Kyiv region, on the scene of the crash of a SES helicopter. Hundreds of people were involved in extinguishing the fire, searching and rescuing the injured, carrying out the initial investigative actions. Our rescuers, police officers, National Guard soldiers, doctors, psychologists, employees of the Security Service of Ukraine. I thank everyone involved in this rescue operation today. I would like to thank the educators of the kindergarten on the territory of which the helicopter crashed. Mrs. Ruslana, Mrs. Olena, Mrs. Tamara, Mrs. Kateryna and all the employees of the kindergarten - I thank you! Thank you for your bold actions, for taking the children out. I would also like to thank the ordinary residents of Brovary, in particular Mrs. Diana, Mrs. Nadiya and others who helped both the children and the wounded. I am grateful to Hlib and Andriy, the guys who also kept self-control and helped. 25 people were injured, including 11 children. 14 people were killed, including one child. My condolences to all those who lost their loved ones! The Security Service of Ukraine has initiated a criminal investigation into this terrible event. I have instructed the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, in cooperation with all other authorized bodies, to clarify all the circumstances of the crash. Today, all the necessary decisions were made regarding the management of the Ministry of Internal Affairs system. We have lost people who were professionals, patriots and reliable managers. Minister Denys Monastyrskyi, Yevhen Yenin, and their colleagues who died in the crash are not people who can be easily replaced. It is a truly great loss for the state. My condolences to the families. The Ministry will be temporarily headed by the Head of the National Police of Ukraine. The tasks for which the Minister was responsible in the context of our defense operation and ensuring the security of the state have also been distributed. The border, the situation in the frontline area, the participation of the National Guard and the police in the fighting are under control. As soon as clear facts are established as to what exactly led to the crash, we will provide this information. Today, as always, we have been in touch with our military all day long. The situation at the front remains difficult, with the epicenter of the most fierce and principled battles in Donbas. We notice a gradual increase in the number of shelling occasions and attempts at offensive actions by the occupiers. I am grateful to all our warriors who are holding their positions! I thank the warriors of the 68th separate hunting brigade and the 36th separate marine brigade for hitting the enemy very effectively and for the resilience we need in Donbas! I also thank the units of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine for the actions that reduce the chances of the occupiers. Today it was announced that Canada is preparing a powerful defense assistance package for Ukraine. In particular, it will include armored vehicles. This is very timely and significant. I thank Canada for its continued support and for the fact that we are preparing together for Russia's attempt to intensify its attacks. No one in the world today will remain unaware of the plans of the terrorist state. I took part in the Davos Forum. The message from Ukraine is very simple and honest: no one in the free world has the opportunity to dawdle now. I know that in the near future there will be new and really necessary steps in support of our defense. We will do our best to ensure that there are as many such steps as necessary to defeat the terrorists. Glory to all our warriors! Eternal memory to all Ukrainians who died because of the war unleashed by Russia! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "There must be justice. When there is no justice, all guidelines in life disappear, except for the simplest ones - except for the desire to survive and take revenge. The revenge for all the evil committed when the enemy destroyed justice. Ukraine did not start this war. This is an unprovoked and brutal aggression with one aim - to destroy our nation and get rich on everything taken away from our country. The scale of the Russian crimes on the Ukrainian soil leaves no doubt - this was the plan of the Russian leadership. These are the terms of the invasion they agreed to. All this terror, killings, torture, looting. Wherever Russian troops entered Ukrainian territory, professional Russian torturers came with them. People are electrocuted, raped, shot in the limbs, starved to death, left without water and sleep... The burial of tortured people in the occupied territory - in the yards of houses, in the forests, on the roadside - is a companion of the Russian state flag. This is the way chosen by this state. The way of the terrorist. The way of the torturer. The way of the murderer. The way of the looter. This is Russia's state choice, and there should come state responsibility. Russia must be brought to justice for every burned Ukrainian city and village. For every destroyed life. For every Ukrainian family killed by Russian missiles, bombs and mines. We must bring back justice. We can bring back justice. We must punish evil. The International Criminal Court has the jurisdiction to prosecute Russian war criminals. The International Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression of Russia against Ukraine will have the jurisdiction to bring to justice the highest officials of the Russian politics and army who launched this war of aggression. The special compensation mechanism will have the power to compensate Ukraine and every person affected by Russian aggression for the damage done by Russia. Compensation should be covered by Russia's assets and all those associated with it. This terrorist war of Russia against Ukraine should be the last such war. Never again should any other state step on such a path of terror. The revenge will not do it. That is why justice is needed. And I thank everyone who helps us on this path to justice! I thank everyone who helps us to save people and protect our country! Life will win. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A few hours ago, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. New members of the meeting were involved. In particular, Acting Minister of Internal Affairs, Head of the National Police of Ukraine Ihor Klymenko. He is in control of everything that depends on the Ministry of Internal Affairs system in terms of our defense and security. The heads of some regional military administrations also took part in the meeting of the Staff today to report on the implementation of the law on national resistance. These are the Volyn, Zhytomyr, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Odesa regional military administrations. I think the reason for such geography is clear. Every element of our defense, including territorial defense, must be properly organized. Of course, the Commander-in-Chief and the commander of the hottest operational direction at the front - Khortytsia - reported to the Staff. We are taking appropriate steps to strengthen our units in the battle for Donbas. By the way, today I would like to celebrate the successes of the border guards of the Luhansk and Kramatorsk detachments, who, together with other warriors of the defense and security forces, are fighting in the Donetsk direction, defending Bakhmut. Thank you, guys, for your resilience and ability to inflict such losses on the enemy that gradually make the occupiers' attacks meaningless! I also thank the warriors of the Dozor special unit of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine for effectively deterring the enemy! Now the key task of our state, all of us and our partners is to increase the feeling of the terrorist state every day that they will not be able to achieve anything in Ukraine. No matter how much time they spend on the war. No matter how much effort they expend and how many of their people the Kremlin's masters throw on the battlefield. The fulfillment of this task consists of various elements, both defense and political. But one of the most important elements is tanks. Modern Western tanks, on the supply of which we are negotiating with our partners. And I thank all those who have already made the relevant decisions. I thank Mr. Charles Michel, President of the European Council, who was in Kyiv today and who very clearly calls on Europe to make a decision on tanks. And the relevant coalition of partners has actually already been formed, and now we are waiting for a decision from one European capital that will activate the prepared chains of cooperation on tanks. I believe that the strength of German leadership will remain unchanged. Today, speaking in the Verkhovna Rada, Charles Michel once again made it absolutely clear that there are no alternatives to the common future of Ukraine and the European Union. \"Without an independent and secure Ukraine, there can be no independent and secure Europe. Without a free Ukraine, there can be no free Europe. We have a common future\". This is what Mr. President of the European Council said, and this can be the motto of our relations and our integration processes this year. We are preparing the next Ukraine-EU Summit, which is scheduled for early February. We are also preparing for the start of negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union - there are all the prerequisites for these negotiations to start this year. Today I met with IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi. We have an important agreement, and it is already being implemented: IAEA missions will be sent to our nuclear power plants. To all of them. This will significantly increase the safety of our nuclear generation. We also discussed the situation around Zaporizhzhia NPP and steps that can restore radiation safety to all humanity, which was violated by Russia. I had a conversation with the President of the United Arab Emirates. I noted the level of cooperation achieved and thanked for the support in the UN. I informed Mr. President about the opportunities that will be opened by the implementation of our Peace Formula and the components of the formula that we can implement together. And I am grateful for the support of these efforts of Ukraine. And today we have several powerful decisions by our partners to strengthen our defense. First of all, in strengthening our artillery. I am grateful to Estonia for another and the largest package of military aid from this country. For howitzers and ammunition. I am grateful to Sweden for the new military package. For NLAW, Archers and IFVs. I am grateful to Denmark for adopting the decision on CAESARs for our warriors. This will significantly strengthen our army. I am grateful to Lithuania for the new military package. For anti-aircraft systems, ammunition and helicopters. And we are preparing for tomorrow's Ramstein - we expect powerful decisions. We expect a powerful military support package from the United States. Thank you to everyone who defends freedom with us! Glory to all our warriors who show resilience and give Ukraine the results it needs!  Glory to everyone who works for the victory! And my congratulations to all those who celebrate the Epiphany, the Baptism of the Lord today. May the power of our faith speed up the purification of our land from Russian evil. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear participants of the victory makers coalition! I am grateful to you for the achieved unity! For this dialogue and cooperation format. We see the results on the battlefield in Ukraine. Thank you. On the battlefield against our common enemy. And I believe that our unity will only become stronger with every new Ramstein. But do we have a lot of time? No. Terror does not allow for discussion. The terror, which burns city after city, becomes insolent when it feels that the defenders of freedom run out of weapons against it. The war started by Russia does not allow delays. And I can thank you hundreds of times and it will be absolutely just and fair, given all that we have already done, – but hundreds of \"thank you” are not hundreds of tanks. All of us can use thousands of words in discussions, but I cannot put words instead of guns that are needed against Russian artillery, or instead of the anti-aircraft missiles that are needed to protect people from Russian airstrikes. I am truly grateful to all of you for the weapons you have provided – every unit! – helps to save our people from terror, but time remains a Russian weapon. We have to speed up! Time must become our common weapon, just like air defense and artillery, armored vehicles and tanks, which we are negotiating about with you. And which, actually, will make the victory. Ladies and Gentlemen! This is the first time I am addressing you in such a format. And I am addressing you not as Ministers of military warehouses, but as Ministers of defense. Defense of everything that makes our world free. Civilized. I am addressing you – those who serve the values of freedom and who remember the world your parents dreamed of for you. I am addressing you – those who themselves dream of a certain world for their children. It is the time now to protect those dreams. This is the future. I am sure you do not want to allow such a world order, where hatred will rule. Your parents would not want that kind of world for you. You would not want such a world for your children. But this is exactly such a world order that Russia seeks for all of us. Not only for Ukraine! But for the whole world! Russia wants the power to destroy nations. And they talk openly about it in Moscow. Russia wants to destroy law and universal human values. And the Russian troops, by their actions, on the territory of Ukraine, are fighting just for this. In order to teach the world to hate. Russia is concentrating its forces, last forces, trying to convince everyone that hatred can be stronger than the world. That is why you and I have to speed up. We have to do it. We must act as fast as a father or mother, who saves their child. As a son or daughter who sees that their parents need immediate help. It is about what kind of world people will live in. People who dream, love and hope. They hope that the freedom will be protected – for Ukraine, for all of Europe, for each and every coalition’s country. It is about people who believe that evil and hatred will always lose. The Kremlin must lose. Ladies and Gentlemen! You are strong people of powerful countries. And I know your bravery. And I appreciate everything you have done and are doing now. I encourage you to make such decisions that can deprive Russian evil of any power. You can start this policy today. It is in your power to make a Ramstein of tanks. Not to bargain about different numbers of tanks, but to open a principled supply that will stop Russian evil. And we also count that your next gatherings will go down in history as Ramstein of F16 and long-range missiles. It is in your power to guarantee such artillery and anti-aircraft defense that will crush terror. It is in your power to make the victory. So may your decisions hit accurately! Just like our heroes on the front lines. Glory to all of our soldiers – soldiers and sailors, sergeants  and foremen, officers and generals! And thank each and every one of you who defends freedom!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today is the day of Ramstein – and defense news for Ukraine, which our diplomatic marathon brings week after week. Not everything can be announced in public – what is being talked about in Ramstein. It is a closed-door discussion – and it should be. But in general, we can conclude that today's Ramstein will strengthen our resilience. The partners are firm in their attitude – they will support Ukraine as much as necessary for our victory. Yes, we will still have to fight for the supply of modern tanks, but every day we make it more obvious there is no alternative to making the decision on tanks. I addressed the participants in the Ramstein meeting today, our Defense Contact Group. And I thank all the partners who firmly supported the Ukrainian position in the discussions that took place. In general, several things were achieved during the week. It's what our diplomatic marathon, which has been going on since my visit to Washington, has brought. Daily calls and negotiations. Public and non-public. We've managed to significantly strengthen our artillery fist. It's extremely strong – both guns and rounds. We have good results with armored vehicles – several hundred combat vehicles have been added to our arsenal. Significant results concerning rockets for multiple launch rocket systems and our anti-aircraft guns. One of the biggest defense packages has been announced by the United States. And I thank President Biden, all the congressmen, all Americans who KNOW that freedom cannot lose. Thanks to our European allies – all the countries that this week took another step in supporting our common defense. Denmark, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, the UK, Finland, Netherlands and others – thank you! Thanks to Canada – and personally to Prime Minister Trudeau! The only thing worth emphasizing is the time, the delivery time. Each agreement must be implemented as quickly as possible – for our defense. The next week, for which we are already preparing, should also bring its defensive fruits. Today, I met with the US senators who arrived in Kyiv – Messrs. Graham, Blumenthal and Whitehouse. Thank you for meaningful negotiations. This year, it's extremely important not to slow down the pace of our cooperation – between Ukraine and the United States – in all spheres. I'm sure it will be so. The main topic is, of course, defense. Protection of our sky, tanks for Ukraine, we need long-range missiles to liberate our territory. I heard understanding of our needs. I spoke with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. About the general situation on the battlefield in Ukraine and in our Black Sea region. About how to implement specific points of our Peace Formula – useful for absolutely everyone in the world. I thank Mr. President for supporting our security vision. Today, the ceremony of receiving credentials from the new ambassadors of the partner states that arrived in Ukraine took place. These are Finland, Cyprus, Austria and Libya. I signed the decree to award our soldiers – 153 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Fighters of the 30th, 53rd, 92nd, 93rd and 110th mechanized brigades, 56th motorized infantry brigade, 60th infantry brigade and 102nd ground defense brigade. I thank everyone who fights for Ukraine! And one more thing. Today is the Day of Remembrance of Defenders of Donetsk Airport. It was one of the hardest and important battles for Ukraine. It was the battle in which modern Ukrainians found our eternal strength. It's that strength that saved Ukraine, it's that strength that demonstrates our steel spirit in the extraordinary resilience and bravery of Ukrainians on the battlefield. I thank everyone who withstood then. I thank everyone who helped then. Great tribute to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine – after February 24, after 2014 and always when our people defended themselves! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and gentlemen! I would like to greet everyone who believes that in the 21st century there must be no famine anywhere in the world. We in Ukraine do believe that. Famine must forever remain in the past and cannot come back. This must be a global goal! The right for food – just like the right for clean water – should be a fundamental right of every human being. On every continent. And anyone who tries to deprive people of food or water is an enemy not only to those, who are doomed to starve or suffer from thirst but also is an enemy to humanity. We must defeat such enemies together! Ukraine has always been and will always be a responsible participant in global food-market relations. Even having suffered from terrorist aggression from Russia, we continue to supply food to the countries all over the world. Although Russia has blocked our ports on the Black Sea, we have found a diplomatic way to resume exports. And I would like to express my gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Guterres and to the President of the Republic of Türkiye Mr. Erdoğan for their timely and effective participation, which resulted in the Black Sea Grain Initiative. This brought millions of tonnes of Ukrainian products back to the world market. Although Russia continues to launch missile attacks at our infrastructure, including ports and transport, and continues brutal battles in the regions that are extremely important for the agricultural production, Ukrainian farmers continue to cultivate the fields. This is our moral constant – there must be wheat on fertile soil, not craters from explosions. We also launched a globally important humanitarian initiative – Grain from Ukraine. We attract the support from developed countries to buy grain and charter ships in order to supply humanitarian food to the countries, which suffer from the threat of famine most of all. And I express my gratitude to everyone who is implementing the initiative Grain from Ukraine with us! Ladies and gentlemen! I call on all of you to take this approach to global food security, based on morality and the need to protect the right of every human for food and water! Before this war which is destroying our potential, including our agricultural potential, we exported six and a half million tonnes of food every month. Due to Russian aggression and actions to block our food exports, the shipments have been cut in half. If we count all that not in tonnes, but in human lives, this will be at least two hundred million people in different countries on three continents – Africa, Asia, and Europe – who now have decreased access to food. Right now, while the discussions at this Forum are going on, more than one hundred ships transporting food are lined up near the Bosphorus. Why? Because they need to be inspected, and Russian representatives are blocking this inspection. The ships are detained for weeks. It means higher prices for Europe. For Asia, it means a growing threat of social instability. In Africa, for such countries as Ethiopia or Sudan, it means empty tables for thousands and thousands of families... This means that the world needs more determination and more cooperation to stop the aggression that ruins the food market. To stop any state that blocks the sea and destroys food-supply chains. To bring to justice any tyrant who tries to make famine an instrument of political influence. Is it possible to overcome famine? Yes. Is it possible to guarantee food security? Yes. Is it possible to stabilize food prices on the world market? Yes, it is. But to do so, we need to punish the aggressors and to help countries on the edge of famine. This is exactly what Ukraine is doing. This is exactly what our partners are doing. I encourage everyone to join-in! Join our initiative Grain from Ukraine. Join our initiative to create food hubs in Africa – in the regions that are critically dependent on food imports. Get involved in the implementation of the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which will stop Russian aggression and restore international law and order in Europe. Thank you for your attention! And I invite you to Kyiv to make concrete arrangements! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ukrainians! Ukrainian women! Today was a long day – operational decisions, international communication, and various issues that deserve attention and response. But now I want to say only one thing. I don't want to talk for a long time. Today, we said farewell to those whose lives were taken by the helicopter crash in Brovary. Denys Monastyrsky, his colleagues from the ministry: Yevhen Yenin, Yuriy Lubkovych, Tetiana Shutiak, Mykhailo Pavlushko, Mykola Anatsky, Andriy Marynchenko... Guys from the crew: Oleksandr Vasylenko, Kostiantyn Kovalenko, Ivan Kasianov... A woman and a child who were just going to kindergarten in the morning... Mother Olena Ponomarenko and her daughter Milana Ponomarenko... My condolences to all relatives and friends... It hurts to think about it, it hurts to say about it. Denys was a professional, genuine person, exactly what the Minister of Internal Affairs should be. Every day we lose people, whom we will always remember and regret that they're not coming back. You cannot bring back Ukrainians, patriots, and people who are professional and simply loyal to themselves and the state. I wish we could all feel that today. Feel how many lives, how many bright people have been taken by wartime. I would like us all to honor their memory today… Great tribute to all those, whose lives were taken away by the war! Great tribute to all those, who gave their lives for Ukraine! We are doing everything to remove this war from our land. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear people! Today we celebrate the Day of Unity of Ukraine. This historical event passed on two pieces of wisdom to the next generations of Ukrainians. If the struggle is not stopped, sooner or later a unified and independent state will be restored. If true unity is not attained, independence will be lost. We have always known about the first piece of wisdom. And on February 24, we proved that we had mastered the second. This became a new revival of our Ukrainian unity. And it's not only uniting two banks of the river. It's uniting millions of people. It's the unity of all our lands. All our regions. Where all for one and one for all. Every region is protecting each other. All of us have no longer strange cities, villages, or streets. Every city is a native city. Every village is a native village. Every street is a native street. Even if we have never been there in our life. And fighters from Kyiv, Lviv, Kryvyi Rih, Zhytomyr, Luhansk and many other cities are fighting for Mariupol, Kupyansk and Izyum. And fighters from Izyum, Kupyansk and Mariupol and many other cities are fighting for Avdiivka, Bakhmut and Soledar. And we all together are defending Kyiv. And we all together are defending Kharkiv. And we all together are liberating Kherson. And we all together, no matter where we were born and where we grew up, say today: I will defend my Ukraine. My unity. My Zakarpattia, my Volyn, my Podillia, my Tavria, my Sivershchyna, my Polissia, my Naddniprianshchyna, my Donbas, my Halychyna, my Prydniprovia, my Slobozhanshchyna, my Pryazovia, my Bukovyna and, of course, my Crimea. And it's not \"yours\" by any means. Our unity is strong. It's strong with the walls of Akkerman Fortress, Palanok Castle, Khotyn Fortress and Kamianets-Podilsky Castle, Medzhybizh Castle, Lubart's Castle, Genoese Fortress. Our unity shines with gold-topped Lavra monasteries. Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, Pochaiv Lavra and Sviatohirsk Lavra. Unity is St. Sophia Cathedral, St. George's Cathedral, the Big Khan Mosque of Bakhchysarai and the synagogue in Dnipro. Unity is encoded in the patterns of our embroidery, the storylines of Kosiv painted ceramics, the Petrykivka decorative painting and the Ornek ornament. Unity can be heard in the sounds of the kobza, bandura, trembita and Crimean Tatar zurna musical instruments. Unity plays beautifully in the music of Leontovych, Skoryk, and Ivasyuk. Unity is rhymed in the lines of Franko, Ukrainka, Shevchenko, Stus, Symonenko and Kostenko. Unity is painted with colors in the canvases of Prymachenko, Bilokur and Marchuk. Unity reigns majestically on Mount Hoverla and Ai-Petri peak. Unity flourishes in bloom of cherry blossom, in the Valley of Narcissus, Sofiyivka Park, Askania-Nova nature reserve. Unity is mysteriously silent in the rocks of Dovbush, basalt columns, Oleshky Sands, the Dniester canyon, the \"Tunnel of Love,\" on the Chernihiv Rampart and the slopes of Vytachiv. Unity thunders at Pivdenmash, Antonov, Kharkiv Tractor Plant and Kryvorizhstal. Unity is extracted in the mines of Luhansk region and Lviv region. Unity is illuminated by knowledge in Kyiv, Berdyansk, Lviv, Hlukhiv, Ostroh, Kharkiv and Chernivtsi. Unity roars in the waves of the rivers of Dnipro, the Danube, the Southern Bug, the Tisza, and the Siversky Donets. In the waters of lakes of Svityaz, Synevyr and Syvash. Across Ukraine. In the summer. In the autumn. In the winter. In the spring. We are defending all this. Together. And we will win. Together. And the entire Ukraine will hear the sounds of victory. My beloved Zakarpattia, Volyn, Podillia, Tavria, Sivershchyna, Polissia, Naddniprianshchyna, Halychyna, Prydniprovia, Slobozhanshchyna, Pryazovia, Bukovyna, Donbas, and, of course, Crimea... My Ukraine. Our Ukraine. We are united because we are strong. We are strong because we are united. Dear people, Happy Ukrainian Unity Day! Dear invincible people, Happy Ukrainian Unity Day! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! The first and foremost I want to talk about today is justice. Justice, which, by the way, is one of the foundations of unity. In a society that feels justice, the unity of people is always stronger. Today, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dismissed a deputy minister who was exposed by NABU. Law enforcers have every opportunity to conduct an investigation and bring the case to the court. And I want this to be our signal to all those whose actions or behavior violate the principle of justice. Of course, now the main focus is on defense, foreign policy, and war. But this does not mean that I do not see or hear what is being said in society at different levels, both at the central level and in the regions. And this week will be a time for appropriate decisions. These decisions have already been prepared. I don't want to announce them now, but it will all be fair. I understand what has drawn people's attention. In each situation, we will analyze everything in detail. The issues related to energy and procurement. The relations between the central government and the regions. Everything related to procurement for the military. And so on. Society will receive full information, and the state will take the necessary powerful steps. In addition, our special services are making progress in their work on people who deserve at least sanctions for their activities against Ukraine, its independence and the Ukrainian people. We will take appropriate steps as well. And this is not something temporary, this is a real response. These are concrete actions. This is what we all expect from our institutions. From the state. I want this to be clear: there will be no return to what used to be in the past, to the way various people close to state institutions or those who spent their entire lives chasing a chair used to live. I thank law enforcement officers who protect the law, the interests of the state, and ensure justice! I am grateful to the journalists who are looking into all the facts and establishing the full picture! We all have to do our part for our unity. It is by justice that the strength of society and the strength of the state are united. And one more thing. Today, our friend Boris Johnson visited Ukraine - Kyiv, Bucha, Borodyanka. A man who does not need any special introduction. Together with him, we talked to students of Shevchenko University. This is also quite symbolic - exactly on our day, the Day of Unity. Symbolic because the struggle for freedom unites different people, different nations. And we have really brought our Ukrainian unity, our historical unification, which we achieved in the first hours of February 24, to international relations over the past year. The free world has united as it has not been united for a long time. It is very important to maintain unity. We need to do everything we can to keep people who value freedom united and effective. We are interested in Boris and our other people like him working on issues of supporting Ukraine in the world, on issues of defending freedom. This is worth remembering for all Ukrainians: the British contribution to our defense is extremely significant. I thank all British people, absolutely all our friends in Britain, the entire society for it. I thank Mr. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for his powerful decisions, for his policies that make the free world stronger. This is what we all should make this year. A year of justice for Ukraine. A year of unity of all of us for the sake of freedom and victory. A year of strength of Ukraine and all those who value freedom. I am grateful to each of our warriors: all those who are at the front, all those who help, all those who save! I thank our partners for their vital support! I am grateful to everyone who understands that we can only go this way together and only by helping each other. Only honestly and fairly. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for your attention to Ukraine and for this opportunity to address those who create the globally important economic strength of America! Tomorrow is eleven months since the start of Russia’s brutal and predatory full-scale war against Ukraine. This is the time when Ukraine, the United States and all our allies and partners are united as never before. What have we achieved together during this time? We fight every day to defend our people, our borders and our values. And we managed to stop the spread of Russian aggression. Today we can say with confidence that we can overcome this evil on Ukrainian soil. Even though Russia has found a terrorist ally in the face of the Iranian regime, which supplies weapons to the Kremlin. Thanks to the courage of our soldiers holding back the occupiers, and thanks to the leadership of the United States of America, which has consolidated the world in defense of freedom, we see how to win this battle. Yet to win, we must engage all our resolve and our strength. It is like starting your own business and working every day from morning till night, every day, so that one day you can see how your dream is becoming true – when you finally have your own operating business. Anyone who has such an experience – the experience of starting their own business and implementing their dreams – will never forget how much effort it takes. The same is defending freedom. As well as defending the basic values of any normal society. At the beginning of this address, I called the Russian war against Ukraine a predatory one. And this is not a random word. Perhaps this is exactly what connects the Kremlin with some anti-democratic regimes in various parts of the world, such as the Iranian regime, – what makes them accomplices. On the entire territory, temporarily occupied by the Russian troops, robbery is reigning. Everything they have not destroyed, they are stealing and shipping to Russia. Everything… Russians are stealing grain and agricultural machinery from Ukrainian farmers. The occupiers dismantle the factories and send the equipment to Russia. Warehouses, shops and people’s homes are being looted. And they kidnap people – they see people as a resource. About two million Ukrainians were forcibly taken to Russia – deported. The fact that Russia tried to steal the part of our land by declaring an illegal annexation – is the finalization of their predatory policy. This is why we so need your support now. Here, in Ukraine, we are defending not only independence and not only the international order. Here in Ukraine, we are defending everything that made you, in particular, who you are. We are defending freedom and property; everyone’s right to have their dream and everyone’s duty to live according to the law; the right of every family to stay safe and the happiness of every family to be part of their community. All this cannot be granted. All this can only be won. Global freedom has long been lacking global victories. Ukraine, together with the United States, along with our partners – is meeting this deficit. However, we need to walk this path together – until the victory. And – when we'll be able to end this war by throwing out the occupiers – in the same manner together we'll be able to start the difficult work of rebuilding Ukraine – our cities, our economy, our infrastructure. It is already clear that this will be the largest economic project of our time in Europe. It is obvious that American business can become the locomotive that will once again push forward global economic growth. We have already managed to attract attention and have cooperation with such giants of the international financial and investment world as Black Rock, J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Such American brands as Starlink or Westinghouse have already become part of our, Ukrainian, way. Your brilliant defense systems – such as HIMARS or Bradleys – are already uniting our history of freedom with your enterprises. We are waiting for Patriots. We are looking closely at Abrams. Thousands of such examples are possible! And everyone can become a big business by working with Ukraine. In all sectors – from weapons and defense to construction, from communications to agriculture, from transport to IT, from banks to medicine. I believe that freedom must always win. And, I invite you to work with us right now. Thanks to all American people – from leaders to every American! God bless our countries and our heroes!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report of the day. The first is military issues. Today we had several detailed conversations with our commanders about the situation in the operational directions. Sometimes it seems that some people in the rear cities have completely forgotten about the war and started to ignore reality, using the protection of our heroes. Ignoring the war is a luxury that no one can afford. Fierce fighting continues in the main operational directions, particularly in Donbas. Enemy shelling and offensives around the clock. However, the battle for Donbas continues. The battle for the south continues. We see what forces Russia is amassing and know how to respond. We will certainly respond to the enemy's regular terrorist attacks on our border areas - Sumy and Kharkiv regions. Ukraine will not show weakness. The state will not show weakness. I’ve signed several decrees today. There is a principled decision of the NSDC on officials traveling abroad. It applies to all officials of the central government and various other levels of local government. It applies to law enforcers, people's deputies, prosecutors and all those who are supposed to work for the state and in the state. If they want to rest now, they will rest outside the civil service. Officials will no longer be able to travel abroad for vacation or for any other non-governmental purpose. Within five days, the Cabinet of Ministers is to develop a border-crossing procedure for officials so that only a real working trip can be the reason for border crossing. Another NSDC decision today concerns our spiritual independence, which we are strengthening and will continue to strengthen. Sanctions have been imposed against 22 Russian citizens who, under the guise of spirituality, support terror and genocidal policy. Also, we have already made personnel decisions - some today, some tomorrow - regarding officials of various levels in ministries and other central government bodies, in the regions, and in the law enforcement system. I’ve held several meetings on our international activities. One was related to the results of Ramstein and what we managed to get for Ukraine. The second meeting was about the new stage of our diplomatic marathon, which was launched after my visit to Washington. I’ve had more than 30 negotiations of various levels with the leaders of our partner states - those we can talk about openly. This marathon yielded the results we needed, a real strengthening of our defense. We are now working to fill February with even more substantive contacts with leaders. Today, I addressed the participants of the winter meeting of American business leaders who are members of the National Association of State Chambers. These are more than 100,000 entrepreneurs who employ about half of the American workforce. It is important for Americans at all levels to know and feel how important and historically necessary our cooperation is - cooperation of Ukraine and the United States. And one more thing. Tomorrow marks exactly 11 months of the full-scale war. It will be the 335th day. A day we will pass in the same way as the 334th, uniting all our forces for one thing - victory. For the sake of Ukraine's victory. Not of someone against someone among us. But for the sake of the whole of Ukraine. For the sake of the victory of our entire country in the war for freedom and independence for all Ukrainians. It will happen. And all the steps necessary for this will be taken. I thank all our warriors at the front! Today I would like to celebrate our anti-aircraft gunners of the Air Forces - you gave us a good day. Russian aircraft, helicopter and missiles were shot down. I would also like to thank the warriors of the 35th separate marine brigade and the 79th separate air assault brigade for their bravery and the results Ukraine needs in the Donetsk direction. Thank you, guys! I thank everyone who steadfastly defends the positions of our country! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we have continued our diplomatic marathon and have new concrete results for our defense, which are very important. Today I had extensive negotiations with President of France Macron. We discussed many topics. I thank Mr. President for his willingness to strengthen Ukraine's air defense and expand our armored cooperation. This armored element is becoming increasingly important for the situation at the front. So is the artillery element. I thank France and Emmanuel personally for the much-needed decisions to strengthen Ukraine's artillery. I am also grateful for the respective leadership within our anti-war coalition. Russia is preparing for a new wave of aggression with the forces it can mobilize. The occupiers are already increasing pressure in the Bakhmut, Vuhledar and other directions. And they want to increase pressure on a larger scale. In order not to recognize the mistake of aggression, the masters of Russia want to throw more of their people and equipment into the fighting. This means that all of us in the free world must step up our cooperation to not only respond to Russia's regular crimes. Although this will happen, of course. There will be a response. But to prevent new Russian criminal actions as much as possible. Our forces must retain the initiative in the war. And I heard today a full understanding of the situation both in a conversation with Mr. President Macron and in a conversation with Mr. President of Finland, who was on a visit to Kyiv today. There is a new package of support from Finland, including defense support. There is a willingness to strengthen sanctions against Russia and to join our diplomatic initiatives. We have a vision of how we can use this year to our countries’ advantage to cooperate within European and Euro-Atlantic institutions. That is, today, thanks to the French and Finnish stages of our diplomatic marathon, we have significantly strengthened Ukraine's defense. The main thing now is the speed of implementation of everything we agreed upon. Today I discussed in great detail the points of our Peace Formula - what can be done together with France, what can be done together with Finland. It is very important for European leadership in these diplomatic efforts to be tangible. And today, in particular in my conversation with Emmanuel, I was pleased to hear his leadership initiatives. I am also grateful to Finland for the vision of the role of this country in guaranteeing our common security under the Peace Formula. I signed several decrees on awarding the defenders of our country. Today is the Day of the Foreign Intelligence of Ukraine. So today I have specially honored intelligence officers with awards. Of course, I can't publicly say the names and specific reasons for the awards, but this is for the work that allows our state to see and understand more. And I want to congratulate all our intelligence officers - those who expand Ukraine's capabilities and significantly reduce the enemy's capabilities. Thank you for your service! I also signed decrees on awarding the warriors of our army, in particular the 93rd separate mechanized brigade, for their personal bravery and heroism. As well as warriors of the National Guard, in particular the 3rd and 4th operational brigades of the National Guard. I am thankful for the strength and resilience to each of our warriors and to each family of such warriors! Today, I also awarded the Air Forces for their much-needed results. And territorial defense warriors - for heroism and exemplary performance of combat missions. Such decrees are always a special honor for me. So is another decree signed today. The capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, starts celebrating the 700th anniversary of its foundation. All this time, the histories of our nations have been closely intertwined. And we actually share a common destiny of our freedom: the more protected one nation is, the more protected the other is. Perhaps this is understood more clearly now than ever before in our history. Ukraine will always be grateful to Lithuania, to Mr. President Nausėda, to all Lithuanian leaders, to all Lithuanian families who perceived the Russian aggression against Ukraine as an attack on their freedom. Who help us protect our common future in a free and peaceful Europe. Today, I signed a decree awarding Vilnius the honorary distinction of a \"Rescuer City\" for everything that the city and Lithuania as a whole have done to help us in the fight against Russian terror. I thank each and every one who fights and works to protect freedom! I thank everyone who helps! By the way, there is a lot of talk about tanks now. About the modern tanks we need. And about how to fill this deficit. A lot of effort, words, and promises. But it is important to see the reality: it is not about five, or ten, or fifteen tanks. The need is greater. Every day we are doing everything necessary to fill the deficit. And I am grateful to everyone who supports us in this. However, discussions need to end with decisions. Decisions to really strengthen our defense against terrorists. Our allies have the necessary number of tanks. When the necessary weight of decisions is reached, we will be happy to express gratitude for every weighty decision. We are still working on this. And one more thing. Today, society has seen yet another set of personnel decisions that have been made. I emphasize the phrase – \"yet another\". We will continue to take appropriate steps - the public will see each of them and, I am sure, will support them. Any internal issues that hinder the state are being removed and will continue to be removed. It is fair, it is necessary for our defense, and it helps our rapprochement with European institutions. We need a strong state, and Ukraine will be just that. And today, by my decree, I put into effect another decision of the National Security and Defense Council. Details will follow later. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is a day of extremely good news for Ukraine. There is a tank coalition. There is a decision to launch the supply of tanks for our defense. Modern tanks. I started this day with a conversation with Chancellor Scholz, primarily about Leopards for Ukraine. And this is exactly the kind of conversation we expected. I thank Mr. Chancellor, all German politicians and public figures for their willingness to strengthen the defense of Europe! There is a very powerful step by the United States - this is how the day begins in America. Ukraine will receive Abrams, thank you for this decision. I personally thank Mr. President Biden, I thank the Congress, I thank every American family for the tangible strength of American global leadership! I am grateful to all our allies for their willingness to provide us with modern and much-needed tanks. All this proves the most important fact for the world today - the fact that freedom is only getting stronger. And the way we are all working together to strengthen freedom, to defend Ukraine and Europe, is a historic achievement of the leaders who are working now. The key thing now is speed and volume. The speed of training of our military, the speed of supplying tanks to Ukraine. The volume of tank support. We must form a tank fist, a fist of freedom whose hits will not let tyranny stand up again. We can do it. Together and only in the same way as we are making decisions today. Important decisions. It is very important that there is progress in other aspects of our defense cooperation as well. Today I spoke with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. We have to unlock the supply of long-range missiles to Ukraine, it is important for us to expand our cooperation in artillery, we have to achieve the supply of aircraft to Ukraine. And this is a dream. And this is a task. An important task for all of us. The more defense support our heroes at the front receive from the world, the sooner Russia's aggression will end and the more reliable the security guarantees for Ukraine and all our partners will be after the war. The terrorist state must lose. The right to life must be protected. And it will be so. There are two more important decisions today. The first is from the ECHR. The second is from UNESCO. The European Court of Human Rights has announced its decision on the admissibility of the case concerning Russia's seizure of the territories of the east of Ukraine in 2014 and the occupiers' large-scale violation of human rights. This is still an interim legal decision. But thanks to this decision, we have become closer to the day when Russia will be held accountable for its aggression, and on the same scale from a legal point of view as Russia has invested in this evil. UNESCO has inscribed the historic center of Odesa on the World Heritage List. Moreover, on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Danger because of the war unleashed by Russia. This international step will help us defend our Odesa. Ukraine and the world give protection. Russia can give nothing but terror and strikes. These are facts. Today I had a meeting with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The conversation was primarily about our people who were forcibly deported to Russia by the occupiers. These are both adults and our children. The world needs a global mechanism of influence in such situations. We need a mechanism to protect and return such people, to bring to justice all those responsible for deportation. I am confident that the UN institutions can show their leadership in resolving this issue. Today I would like to praise our units that continue to hold back the occupier's attacks in the Donetsk region. This is where Russia is constantly trying to break our defense. Dozens of enemy attacks every day. And at least hundreds of examples of heroism of our warriors every day. I thank the warriors of the 110th separate mechanized brigade, 79th separate air assault brigade, 35th separate marine brigade and 55th separate artillery brigade. Thank you, warriors, for your resilience and courage, which inspire the world to provide more and more assistance to Ukraine! And one more thing. I would like to express gratitude for the very touching words of support and congratulations that I have heard and seen from so many different people. From the military. From the leaders and ordinary people. From all Ukrainians and foreigners. From colleagues now and colleagues before. Thank you all! I think we have the same wish, in fact. A common wish. This is victory. We will do it. We are doing everything for the sake of Ukraine's victory. And it will happen. I know it will. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, we withstood another massive missile strike by terrorists. A strike that fully confirms everything we have been talking about with our partners both yesterday and since the beginning of our diplomatic marathon. This evil, this Russian aggression can and should be stopped only with adequate weapons. The terrorist state will not understand anything else. Weapons on the battlefield. Weapons that protect our skies. New sanctions against Russia, i.e. political and economic weapons. And legal weapons - we need to work even harder to establish a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine and to compensate for all the damage caused by this war at the expense of Russian assets. Every Russian missile against our cities, every Iranian drone used by terrorists is an argument why we need more weapons. Only weapons neutralize terrorists. And I am grateful to everyone in the world who is really fighting terror together with us. Who is speeding up the supply of necessary defense equipment to Ukraine and who is willing to increase sanctions pressure on the terrorist state. In particular, we are expanding our tank coalition - there is a corresponding decision of Canada, and I am grateful for it. We already have 12 countries in our tank coalition. Today, thanks to the air defense systems provided to Ukraine and the professionalism of our warriors, we managed to shoot down most of the Russian missiles and Shaheds. These are at least hundreds of lives saved and dozens of infrastructure facilities preserved. And I thank our Air Forces, each and every one who last night, this morning and afternoon ensured the defense of Ukraine against terrorists’ missiles and drones. I would like to especially praise the warriors of the 96th Kyiv, 160th Odesa and 208th Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades. Unfortunately, it is difficult to provide 100% protection with air defense alone. Especially when terrorists use ballistic missiles. Today there were missile hits. Unfortunately, there are wounded and dead. My condolences to all the families and friends... This Russian terror requires asymmetrical responses. We need a new movement of our forces at the front. We need to ensure the defeat of the terrorists' ground forces. Whatever the Russian occupiers are planning, our preparation must be stronger. We talk about it with our partners. And we discuss it at the meetings of the Staff. Today was just such a meeting. Details about the situation in the Donetsk region. Bakhmut, Vuhledar and the battle for Donbas in general. I am grateful to all our units who demonstrate the resilience Ukraine needs, exhausting the occupier and destroying it. The more Russia loses in this battle for Donbas, the less its overall potential will be. At the meeting of the Staff we also discussed in detail what we should prepare for in the coming months. We know what the occupiers are planning. We are countering it. This applies both to the supply of weapons and ammunition and to the overall strengthening of our defense forces. Today, I held operational meetings on the situation in the energy sector - on existing deficits and recovery from terrorist attacks. Repair crews are working in all locations of the hits. As of now, there are electricity supply restrictions in most of our regions. The most difficult situation is in Odesa, Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Sumy and Poltava regions. Power engineers, utility workers and everyone involved in stabilizing the energy system will do everything necessary to restore generation and technical supply capacity. I thank everyone involved in this work. I also thank everyone in the world who has helped and is helping Ukraine with energy equipment. To every country, every company and every person - to those millions of our friends who, through United24 or other support tools, prove that Russian terror must lose. And one more thing. Unfortunately, I have to repeat this for those who did not hear it well. Any trip abroad by government officials, MPs, representatives of local authorities and other persons authorized to perform the functions of the state or local self-government, any of their trips abroad must comply with the relevant decision of the National Security and Defense Council, which you have all seen. There will be no other trips abroad by officials or MPs in wartime. I think this is fair. I thank everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! I thank everyone who is working for our country and society! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by Russian terrorists! Russia will be held accountable for terror. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Today, as always, Ukraine honors the memory of millions of Holocaust victims. We know and remember that indifference kills along with hatred. Indifference and hatred are always capable of creating evil together only. That is why it is so important that everyone who values life should show determination when it comes to saving those whom hatred seeks to destroy. Today we remember the Righteous Among the Nations. Different people in different countries who were equally determined to save lives. Today we remember the determination of the global coalition that stopped Nazism. And today we repeat it even more strongly than before: never again to hatred; never again to indifference. The more nations of the world overcome indifference, the less space there will be in the world for hatred. Eternal memory to all victims of the Holocaust!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today we are starting a marathon of honesty, which will be aimed at clearing the leadership of international Olympic structures of hypocrisy and any attempts to bring representatives of the terrorist state into world sports. One cannot but be disappointed by the statements of the current President of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach. I spoke with him several times. And I never heard how he is going to protect sports from war propaganda if he returns Russian athletes to international competitions. There is no such thing as neutrality when a war like this is going on. And we know how often tyrannies try to use sports for their ideological interests. It is obvious that any neutral flag of Russian athletes is stained with blood. I do not want to get into what exactly motivated Mr. Bach to promote such an initiative. But we will do everything so that the world will protect sports from political and any other influence of the terrorist state, which is simply inevitable if Russian athletes participate in competitions. And especially – at the Paris Olympics. Ukrainian athletes are forced to defend the lives of their loved ones and the freedom of our people from Russian aggression. Russian strikes took the lives of hundreds of Ukrainian men and women who could have brought their talents to world sports. Russia must stop aggression and terror, and only after that it will be possible to talk about Russian participation in the context of the Olympic movement. Olympic principles and war are fundamentally opposed to each other. The situation at the front, and in particular in Donetsk region – near Bakhmut and Vuhledar, remains extremely acute. The occupiers are not just storming our positions – they are deliberately and methodically destroying these towns and villages around them. Artillery, aviation, missiles. The Russian army has no shortage of means of destruction. And it can be stopped only by force. Our soldiers, who are defending the areas in Donetsk region, are real heroes. I thank each of you guys for your bravery! And, by the way, I invite Mr. Bach to Bakhmut. So that he could see with his own eyes that neutrality does not exist. I spoke today with students, teachers and graduates of the College of Europe in Natolin and Bruges. This is a special educational institution that prepares specialists to work in and with European structures. It is precisely such specialists that we need, in particular, for the full integration of our state with the European Union. Ukrainians are already studying under the programs of the College of Europe. And we have already started creating such a college in Ukraine. And this underlines our desire to fully and as soon as possible integrate with the EU. And also, I am sure, it will enable Ukrainians to help protect freedom and European values both in our region and throughout Europe. I heard from the rector of the college in Natolin that free Europe now has a Ukrainian face. And such words mean a lot. We will always do everything to increase our potential in relations with the EU, in particular, personnel potential. That is why we need our own Ukrainian College of Europe. And it will be. Today we have important news from Belgium – the country where the governing structures of the European Union are located. There is a decision by the Belgian government on a package of support for our defense. It is that will strengthen our air defense. It is that will increase the mobility of our troops on the battlefield. I thank you for this support. I thank all the countries, all the leaders, who this week proved with their decisions that Russian aggression will be defeated. And one more. A ceremony honoring the memory of all victims of the Holocaust was held this morning in Kyiv near the Menorah memorial sign in Babyn Yar. Today is International Holocaust Remembrance Day. And even at such a time, during the full-scale war, Ukraine, together with the entire civilized world, feels and shares the pain that still remains in the world from the crimes of Nazism. We remember. And so we resist the evil's attempts to return. I thank everyone who protects humanity together with Ukraine! I thank all our soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! And dear all our partners! Today, at 9:00 a.m., the Russian army launched a missile attack on our city of Kostiantynivka, in Donetsk region. The enemy used S-300 missiles. Hitting the residential area. As of now, 17 names are on the list of victims. Fourteen have been injured. Three people have died. My condolences to families and friends... These Russian missiles hit four residential buildings in Kostiantynivka. And such shelling, unfortunately, is an everyday reality in our territories, which the Russian army reaches with such missiles. Donbas, Kharkiv region, the south of the country... It would have been possible to stop this Russian terror if we could provide the appropriate missile capabilities of our military. So that terrorists do not have a sense of impunity. Ukraine needs long-range missiles – in particular, to remove this possibility of the occupiers to place their missile launchers somewhere far from the front line and destroy Ukrainian cities with them. Thank you to everyone in the world – politicians, public figures, journalists, and ordinary people who insist with us that there cannot be any taboo in the supply of weapons to protect against Russian terror. We will do everything we can to ensure that partners open up this vital supply – in particular, the supply of ATACMS and other similar weapons. As it is necessary to protect life. Protect such cities as Kostyantynivka or, for example, Kharkiv. Today, I continued our marathon of honesty, which should return international sports bodies to true Olympic principles. I addressed the presidents of the leading international sports federations with a letter. The appeal is simple and fair – to determine with the decision of the International Olympic Committee, which, unfortunately, wants to open sports to the propaganda influence of the terrorist state. If Russian athletes appear in international competitions, it is only a matter of time before they begin justifying Russia's aggression and using the symbols of terror. And it is also only a matter of time – when the Kremlin will start using the existing unprincipled \"flexibility\" of the International Olympic Committee to say that the world agrees to make concessions to the aggressor. It cannot be ignored that every day Russia continues its terror. Today, I signed a decree on the implementation of the NSDC decision on sanctions against legal entities and individuals used by the aggressor state to transport military equipment and soldiers by rail. It concerns 185 companies and individuals. Their assets in Ukraine are being blocked, the available property will be used for our defense. We will work to ensure that similar blocking is applied by other countries. I thank everyone who helps us strengthen sanctions against Russia! And by the way, thanks to all the investigators who are exposing the ways that the terrorist state is using to try to circumvent sanctions! Thank you to everyone who eliminates the consequences of Russian shelling and saves the wounded! And of course – I thank each of our soldiers at the front who defend our positions and destroy the occupier! I especially want to note today the units most effectively defending Donetsk region. This is the 21st separate battalion of the 56th separate motorized infantry brigade – thank you for your effectiveness in repelling the Russian assaults! Soldiers of the 26th and 55th separate artillery brigades – thank you for your accuracy! Ninety-second Separate Mechanized Brigade – thank you, guys! Thank you to everyone who provides the necessary results for Ukraine every day and every night! And we will respond to every Russian strike. That's for sure. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. The main focus, of course, was on the situation at the front, primarily Donetsk and the southern directions. The situation is very tough. Bakhmut, Vuhledar and other areas in the Donetsk region are under constant Russian attacks. There are constant attempts to break through our defense. The enemy does not count its people and, despite numerous casualties, maintains a high intensity of attacks. In some of its wars, Russia has lost in total less people than it loses there, in particular near Bakhmut. And this can only be countered by extraordinary resilience and a full understanding that by defending the Donetsk region, our warriors are defending the whole of Ukraine. Because every prevented step of the enemy there means dozens of prevented steps of the occupiers in other directions. I am grateful to all our units and to each warrior personally who, despite everything, is holding their ground and repelling enemy attacks in the Donetsk region. Today, I would like to praise the warriors of the 72nd separate mechanized brigade and the 80th separate air assault brigade for their perseverance in performing combat missions in the Donetsk direction. I would also like to commend our warriors in the southern areas. In particular, the 44th and 406th artillery brigades, as well as reconnaissance units of the 123rd and 124th territorial defense brigades. Thank you for your accuracy, warriors, thank you for your bravery! The Commander-in-Chief, the commanders of operational directions, and the Minister of Defense reported at the Staff meeting today on the nature of the enemy's actions, our response, and the supply of ammunition and equipment to combat units. The head of intelligence reported on the possible shift in the situation in the near future. We are doing everything to ensure that our pressure outweighs the occupiers' assault capabilities. And it is very important to maintain the dynamics of defense support from our partners. The speed of supply has been and will be one of the key factors in this war. Russia hopes to drag out the war, to exhaust our forces. So we have to make time our weapon. We must speed up the events, speed up the supply and opening of new necessary weaponry options for Ukraine. This week, we have significant defense results in relations with the United States, Germany, Poland, Canada, Belgium, Norway, Italy, and other countries. We have to make the next week no less powerful for our defense. Today, I also spoke with President-elect of the Czech Republic Pavel. I heard a full understanding of the situation. I invited Mr. President to visit Ukraine. I am confident that together we will be able to significantly strengthen our common European response to the Russian terrorist threat. Today I held a long meeting with our security sector - the Security Service of Ukraine and other special services. We are strengthening our state and will appropriately stop anyone who tries to weaken Ukraine from within. And one more thing. Today, the Russian army has been shelling Kherson atrociously all day. Residential buildings, various social and transport facilities, including a hospital, post office, and bus station, have been damaged. Two women, nurses, were wounded in the hospital. As of now, there are reports of six wounded and three dead. My condolences to all those who have lost loved ones to Russian terror... In such circumstances, against the backdrop of such constant Russian terrorist attacks on our cities and villages, against the backdrop of constant Russian assaults that try to leave no single intact wall, it is even shocking that we have to convince international sports bureaucrats to refuse any support for the terrorist state. The International Olympic Committee's attempt to get Russian athletes back to compete and participate in the Olympics is an attempt to tell the world that terror can allegedly be something acceptable. As if it is possible to turn a blind eye to what Russia is doing to Kherson, to Kharkiv, to Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Today, I sent a letter to Mr. President Macron about this very issue to follow up on our conversation with him on January 24. As we prepare for the Paris Olympics, we must be sure that Russia will not be able to use it or any other international sporting event to promote aggression or its state chauvinism. In the first half of the XX century, too many mistakes were made in Europe that led to horrific tragedies. There was also a major Olympic mistake. The Olympic movement and terrorist states should definitely not intersect. I thank everyone who helps protect our people from Russian terror! I thank each and every one who bravely defends Ukraine in the ranks of our defense and security forces! May the memory of all those who fought for the independence and integrity of Ukraine in the Battle of Kruty and in every other battle that helped our people to survive and gain their own state be bright! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I am on a working trip all day - first to Mykolaiv, then to Odesa. Meeting and negotiations with the Danish delegation - with Prime Minister Frederiksen, representatives of the coalition of parties. In particular, with the Danish Minister of Defense and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. They are part of the delegation. We talked in great detail about Ukraine's defense needs. About what can help us liberate our territory - our south, our east. And about our needs in the context of rebuilding Ukraine. Mykolaiv is a city the reconstruction of which Denmark has taken patronage over. There is a need for projects in the energy sector, infrastructure, social sphere, and production. An especially sensitive issue for Mykolaiv is water purification and restoration of normal water supply, which was destroyed by the Russian occupiers. There is already a corresponding project with the participation of Denmark, the implementation of which has already begun. But much more needs to be done to restore and modernize what is the basis of our people's lives. Today in Mykolaiv, we visited a hospital where our warriors are being saved after wounds. We thanked the doctors and nurses. We supported our defenders. This hospital is just one of those examples where modernization and reconstruction are critical. And I want to thank Denmark, personally Mrs. Prime Minister and other representatives of the Danish Government for their willingness to help Ukraine. For the willingness to support until the full restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity and until the complete reconstruction of everything necessary for life. This is the fundamental meaning of our cooperation with partners. Russian terror must lose everywhere and in everything - both on the battlefield and in the absence of ruins in our country - so that we can rebuild everything and thus prove that freedom is stronger. Today in Odesa, we spoke in detail about our security and humanitarian initiatives. Denmark, in particular, has supported our Black Sea export initiative and joined the Grain from Ukraine program. The fact that we have made substantial progress on food security proves that we can make progress on the other points of our Peace Formula as well. Today we discussed what exactly Denmark's participation in the implementation of the points of the Peace Formula could be. Of course, I thanked Denmark for their defense support, for significantly strengthening our artillery, for their willingness to join the tank coalition. Today we discussed what else we can do to reinforce Ukrainian warriors. We are also coordinating our actions to strengthen sanctions against Russia. I have also called on Denmark to join our efforts to protect sports structures and the international Olympic movement from discrediting by the attempts of certain representatives of the sports bureaucracy to allow Russian athletes to participate in international competitions. Of course, I paid special attention to the internal situation in the Mykolaiv and Odesa regions, holding relevant meetings with the military and regional leadership. It is not only about security, although the security of our south is the first priority, but also about the social situation in the regions, about the economic opportunities available. By the way, I am grateful to all entrepreneurs and employers in Mykolaiv, Odesa, other cities and communities who, despite everything, keep jobs and pay salaries and taxes. This is your concrete and significant contribution to our country's ability to defend itself. Our task to endure is a common task. It is the task of the Defense and Security Forces, our entire state, business, and everyone who works for Ukraine's victory. Thank you to everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who is helping! Thank you to everyone who is defending Odesa, who is defending Mykolaiv, our entire south and all of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on the day. We are finalizing our preparations for the Ukraine-EU Summit scheduled for this week. In general, this week will be a week of European integration in every sense of the word. We are expecting the news for Ukraine. We are expecting the decisions from our partners in the European Union that will be in line with the level of cooperation achieved between our institutions and the EU, as well as with our progress. Progress, which is obvious - even despite the full-scale war. Today I held a long meeting with the international bloc of the government and the Office. We are preparing Ukrainian positions for negotiations with EU representatives. And very importantly, we are preparing new reforms in Ukraine. Reforms that will change the social, legal and political reality in many ways, making it more human, transparent and effective. But these details will be announced later, based on the results of the relevant meetings. Today, as in fact every day, I held several meetings with the military and the head of intelligence. We are studying the situation in detail in all major operational directions and in the long term. What the occupier is preparing for, and how we are already responding to Russia's preparations for a revanche attempt. Our defense and security forces, the Ukrainian government, our partners - all of us are making efforts to ensure that Russia not only fails in regaining ground on the battlefield, but also loses its last hope for aggression in its revanche attempts. Russia's defeat will prevent any alternatives to a lasting and reliable peace. I thank all our partners who support this position of Ukraine. Today I spoke with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. I briefed him on the situation on the battlefield - on the constant assaults in the Donetsk region, on the situation in the south and the existing threats. We discussed how our defense cooperation could be supplemented. We separately touched upon the issue of sanctions and Russia's international isolation. In particular, I am grateful to Justin for understanding our call to the international Olympic bodies that any concessions to a terrorist state are unacceptable. The Olympic movement and international sport in general must be protected from Russia's usual attempts to politicize sports - we have seen this repeatedly at different times. Now, Russian politicization of sports will inevitably mean justification of terror. This must not be allowed. It is only together that the free world can protect sport from those sports bureaucrats who are willing to turn a blind eye to reality for some reason. Today I also spoke with Prime Minister of Belgium Alexander De Croo. I thanked him for the powerful defense package that was recently approved. We discussed our cooperation on international platforms, particularly within the UN. We discussed sanctions against Russia and the next sanctions package. We also talked about cooperation in protecting sports and the Olympic movement from propaganda of terror. And one more thing. Now there is a certain lull with personnel decisions... But this does not mean that all the necessary steps have been taken. There will be decisions. Those in the system who do not meet the fundamental requirements of the state and society should not linger in their chairs. I thank each and every one who is defending the state! I thank everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! I am grateful for every Ukrainian position held at the front! I am also grateful for every destroyed position of the enemy! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is a fruitful day for our country - a fruitful day in confronting those who are trying to weaken Ukraine even now. We will not allow anyone to weaken our state. I thank all law enforcement officials who have demonstrated the power of law and the power of the state today. I am grateful to the Government of Ukraine for its prompt personnel response. In particular, today the heads of customs service were dismissed. I have been informed that disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against some of those dismissed. Unfortunately, in some spheres, the only way to guarantee legitimacy is to change leaders along with institutional changes implementation. Change as much as necessary to ensure that people do not abuse power. Today, the Security Service of Ukraine, the State Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Economic Security and the Prosecutor's Office have conducted dozens of searches and other actions in different regions and against different individuals in the framework of open criminal proceedings. I do not want to make political assessments that can be used by these individuals in the interests of their defense. But I see from the reaction in society that people approve the actions of law enforcers. Hence, the movement towards justice is tangible. And justice will be ensured. The purity of processes within the Ministry of Defense and the defense forces in general is especially important. Any internal supply, any procurement - everything must be absolutely as clean and honest as the external supply for our defense. Those who interfere with this will not remain in the relevant structures. And today I would like to thank the officers of the National Police of Ukraine, who quickly responded to the disgraceful facts that became known yesterday... Facts of abuse against girls. Criminal proceedings have been initiated. There are the first detentions of the perpetrators. Procedural actions are ongoing. There will be no place for violence in Ukraine. Today was also a rather active day of diplomacy - the President of Austria visited our country together with several ministers of the Austrian government. There are significant intergovernmental agreements, and there is a clear understanding that Austria will not be neutral in the defense of life and Europe. There is a clear Austrian position condemning Russian aggression and willingness to further increase pressure against Russia for terror. I thank Mr. President of Austria, representatives of Austrian municipalities for standing with Ukraine. Of course, today I held several operational meetings with our military. There is a certain increase in the occupiers' offensive actions at the front – in the east of our country. The situation is becoming even more severe. I am grateful to all our warriors who are ready for this and who demonstrate the resilience Ukraine needs. We have steadfastly gone through all this time, from February to February. The enemy is trying to gain at least something now to show on the anniversary of the invasion that Russia allegedly has some chances. In such circumstances, we all need to be especially united, especially focused on the national interest, and, as a result, especially resilient. I am confident that we will stay like that. In the evening, I signed traditional decrees awarding our warriors. 244 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine received state decorations. I am grateful to everyone who fights for Ukraine! I am grateful to everyone who helps us get the weapons we need! I am grateful to everyone in the world who supports us! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Mrs. President of the European Commission, dear Ursula! Dear attendees! Ladies and Gentlemen, European Commissioners, dear government officials, dear Mr. Prime Minister! This is indeed a historic moment, as we have just said - from today you are colleagues in the full sense of the word. My congratulations. Previously, we could say: colleagues in creating a common future for Ukraine and the European Union. Now we say: colleagues in creating a common present reality of Ukraine and the European Union, our life, which is already being united before our eyes. It is being united on completely different, I would say many levels - at the level of our institutions, politics, legal reality, economic life, social life, energy sector, environmental protection, and, of course, our common security and defense. Ukraine and the European Union are no longer separate entities in European life. Our values are common. Our destiny is common. Our enemy is common. Our defense is common. Hence, our life is also being united. Today, Mrs. President of the European Commission, dear Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, handed me a report on the second part of Ukraine's responses to the questionnaire provided by the European Commission in the framework of acquiring Ukraine's candidacy for EU membership. This report contains a thorough analysis of the state of approximation of law of our country to the EU acquis. But it is also, I think, something more. It is a symbol of the fact that the goal of full-fledged unification of Ukraine and the European Union has already turned into concrete, practical, and rather quick work at your level, Mr. Prime Minister - the level of government officials. Now, based in particular on this report of the European Commission, our Government will begin self-screening - a meaningful self-assessment of what we are already pretty close to and what we still need to work on to bring Ukrainian legislation in specific areas in line with the EU acquis. What is the goal here? I want it to be very clear: This year should be the time when no obstacles remain to the start of negotiations on Ukraine's full membership in the EU. Ukraine will fulfill its part of the job. It has to do it and it will do it. Society really wants that. Ladies and Gentlemen, members of the Ukrainian government! Your work on self-screening of our country should become the basis of the National Plan of Approximation to the EU Legislation. Mrs. Olha Stefanishyna, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine, will be responsible for coordinating the preparation of this Approximation Plan. And I expect that every official of our state will help implement this important and truly historic task at their own level. We must work to adapt Ukraine's legal reality to the norms and practices of the European Union as quickly as we have worked to obtain the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. We expect an important decision this spring already. We would really like to see it from our colleagues at the European Commission exactly this spring. The work of our Government and the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the implementation of the seven recommendations outlined in the European Commission's opinion on our candidacy is about to be completed. Accordingly, in the spring, it will be time for the European Commission to make an interim assessment of the implementation of these recommendations. Ladies and Gentlemen! Mentally, we are already together - Ukraine and the European Union. The routine of our lives is already being united. It is no longer possible to imagine a united Europe, a united European society without Ukraine, without the people of our country. And our institutions are already de facto interacting as they should between an EU member state and the EU. Now we have to confirm all this at the political and legal levels. The key step will be the launch of membership negotiations, and I hope that we will be able to announce this important step very soon. As for today's meeting and negotiations in such a progressive format, the first of its kind in Ukraine – the European Commission Board and the Government of Ukraine, we will be talking about quite obvious economic, social and security specifics. About things that will definitely strengthen us all, both Ukraine and the European Union. So that Ukrainians and all Europeans, our companies and businesses in the EU feel the concrete benefits of our unification. That is, more security, more jobs, more energy sustainability and more economic growth, which is especially important for us in this time of war, a time of ordeals for our society, for our entrepreneurs, for our businesses, surely for the entire European continent. There is an updated Priority Action Plan for enhanced implementation of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area for the next two years. This includes further integration of Ukraine's economic sectors and the EU market. This means industrial visa-free regime, Ukraine's accession to the EU roaming zone, further transport and trade liberalization, and other quite practical things. Our people, our communities, Ukrainian businesses and businesses across the EU should feel an increase in their opportunities. And a real strengthening of Europe. Because the stronger our institutions are, the more practice we have, the more practical cooperation we have, the more results integration produces in Europe, the more guarantees we will have to protect Europe from any attempts by any enemy of Europe to destabilize or destroy our lives. So I wish you all today fruitful work and mutual understanding, which should always be the case between true colleagues. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear President Biden! Vice President Harris! Dear members of Congress! Your Majesty King Abdullah! Each and everyone who has faith! I am glad that for 70 years this tradition of prayer breakfasts, which was started during the time of President Eisenhower, has been preserved to this time. This is a symbol that despite any, even the worst, circumstances, the best in people still prevails, and prayer continues. If you recall the Psalms of David, you will pay attention to how often they ask the Lord to hear the prayer. We never know whether our prayer has come close to perfection, and whether the Lord heard it. And that's why in harsh times – when we lose loved-ones; when people lose their children, which is the worst thing; when life is at risk; when a criminal war is conducted against your people; – faith may stagger. It happens that people think that God doesn't hear and will not hear prayer. And it is important for us, as leaders of nations, to resist despair. \"But you, Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high!.. I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the Lord sustains me; Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear!\". These words – at the beginning of the Book of Psalms, and their determination balances the doubts, that are found later in the Book. Because this is confidence in the Lord, who hears and who sees what is in a person's heart. Millions of Ukrainians are asking for the expulsion of the invaders from our homeland, and so – for the restoration of peace. We believe in God. We do not allow despair. Thanks to the bravery of our soldiers. Thanks to the help of friends of freedom in the world – thanks to President Biden and all of you – the leaders and people who help. And we have that chance! A chance to drive-out the evil that came to our land under the Russian flag. \"We have a chance – a chance to make hope and history rhyme\". These words were said at the prayer breakfast last year. This year, we see in concrete actions – in our joint actions with you – how this chance is realized. We have been standing against evil for almost a year. We are united, as we have not been for a long time. And we are brave – our heroic soldiers have already hit evil on the battlefield. Did it happen only due to the efforts of just people? Or were our prayers heard by God? None of us is allowed to know. And this is one of God's best incentives for people.  One of the best stimuli is that majestic silence, in which the human heart turns to God in prayer. When He gives a person the opportunity to become better. When He enables the actions of people to rhyme their own hopes with their own history. Does He help us with this? I'm sure He does. But people's actions are needed – you have to wake up to say that the Lord is sustaining you. And I thank you all, America, thank you all, our friends in the world, for waking up together last year! We stand together. And we must do everything we can together so that next year – on the first Thursday of February – we will be able to pray simply with thanks for the obtained salvation from evil. May the Lord protect you all!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today there was no shortage of statements and comments throughout the day, no shortage of news, especially in the diplomatic sphere. That's why today's report is brief. I will start with something that has not yet been reported. Today, I held a meeting of the Staff, for the first time in a dual format. First, the traditional full composition of the Staff. We reviewed the situation at the front, Russia's attempts to increase pressure in Donbas. The issue of supplying the army. Training of personnel and other issues of constant attention of the Staff. And then, in the afternoon, an additional meeting of the members of the Staff in a narrow format. For a particularly important conversation. We will not leave any aggressive action of the invader without our response. The enemy is at a specific stage when Russia's strategic defeat is already clear. But tactically, they still have the resources to attempt offensive actions. They are looking for options to try to change the course of the war and are trying to put the potential of all the territories they still control in the service of aggression. We have to continue what we are doing: strengthen our resilience, be absolutely united in our aspiration to provide our army and all defenders with the necessary weapons and equipment - we in Ukraine need to speak with one voice to the world on defense supplies. We also need to tangibly increase global pressure on Russia every month. The enemy must come out of this stage much weaker than they anticipate in the worst-case scenario. This is a difficult task for us. But we must accomplish it. We also continue our fight against the internal enemy. I am grateful to the Security Service of Ukraine, the State Bureau of Investigation, the Prosecutor General's Office and all those who are involved in the cleansing of our country. New steps will follow. Today, in the framework of negotiations with the President of the European Commission and members of the European Commission Board, we have reached very important mutual understandings. That only together a strong Ukraine and a strong European Union can protect the life we value. That Ukraine needs unwavering and full support in its defense against Russia. And that we must, through our further integration, give energy and motivation to our people to fight despite any obstacles and threats. I believe that Ukraine deserves to reach the beginning of negotiations on EU membership this year already. And I thank Mrs. President of the European Commission, her colleagues and our friends in the EU for their tangible support on the path of integration and in protecting our country and people. This includes military, financial, energy and social support. And these are the changes by which we ensure more interaction between our institutions - institutions of Ukraine and the EU. Tomorrow is the second European integration day of the week. The Ukraine-EU Summit will take place. We are preparing. And one more thing. Today I took part in the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC. This is an annual event that brings together the most powerful representatives of the American state and society. President Biden was there, as well as senators and members of the House of Representatives, leaders of religious communities and various political communities. I urged them to do everything we can and as we must in confronting the Russian evil, so that the power of our actions could complement the power of our prayers. Prayers for salvation from evil, for victory over the invaders, and for peace for all our people - in all municipalities of free Ukraine. I thank each and every one of our warriors! All soldiers and sailors, sergeants and foremen, officers and generals! To everyone who is resilient! I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! May all those who pray for our victory be heard! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Another Ukraine-European Union summit took place today. It was held in Kyiv, our capital. We have quite specific agreements with our partners on how Ukraine will become even closer to the European Union. This morning in Ukraine, like many others, began with an air raid alert. This day, like many others, was spent in extremely brutal battles at the front. But all the same, this evening we can say that Ukraine is moving towards its goal. We've preserved Ukrainian freedom. We're protecting the values of Ukraine. And we will achieve the goals of our state. European goals of our state. Today, there was a lot of confidence in this during the summit. We spoke and are already speaking as members of the European community. And we are working to fix this de jure. What exactly did we agree on today? There is an understanding that it is possible to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union this year. The partners also understand that this year, as last year, we have to continuously strengthen the defense support of our country and the pressure on Russia, in particular the sanctions pressure. We talked today about the tenth EU sanctions package, which is currently being prepared. There are our proposals for this package – we announced them to our partners today. We discussed changes in the institutions of our state, which we are implementing. And which we are still preparing to implement. Financial cooperation was discussed. Of course, we discussed the restoration of infrastructure, primarily social and energy. Also, the implementation of our Fast Recovery Plan, what needs to be restored now. I thank the European Commission for the decision on EUR 1 billion, which will be sent specifically to Fast Recovery. We are preparing for greater integration of Ukraine into the internal market of the EU – it means more income for Ukrainian companies, more production and jobs in our country, and more income for state and local budgets. That is, it is what makes Ukraine really stronger. And for me, it is very important that there are specifics regarding such areas as, for example, replacing the children's boarding school system in our country with another one. More civilized and friendly to children who, unfortunately, do not have parental care. Children should have a family. Raising children in family-type orphanages is definitely much better than the old boarding school system. We will make this reform together with the European Union. An appropriate office will be created to be responsible for this reform. And preliminary agreements regarding this reform have already been outlined. I have already reported on the various arrangements regarding our Peace Formula. These are specific ten points, the implementation of which will definitely make it possible to restore our territorial integrity and security, not only of Ukraine but also of the whole of Europe and the international legal order. That is, to restore everything that Russia's aggression is destroying. Today, the European Union officially supported the Ukrainian Peace Formula. This was recorded in the final statement of the summit. And we agreed on concrete assistance from the EU in implementing our Peace Formula. This is a significant diplomatic achievement. And we are doing everything to make Russia's aggression suicidal for it. The situation at the front remains very difficult, especially in Donetsk region. I thank all our soldiers who withstand the harsh pressure of the occupiers and who clearly and completely fulfill the task of defending our positions. And who, even in such difficult conditions as on the front lines now, bring Ukraine good news. In particular, I thank the 10th mountain assault brigade for successful counteroffensive actions in Donetsk region! Thanks to the fighters of the 54th separate mechanized brigade – for their bravery and true Ukrainian resilience in the battles for Donbas! The 81st separate airmobile brigade and the 66th separate mechanized brigade – I thank you, guys, for the protection of Luhansk region and steel strength! And I would like to single out our National Guardsmen – the 3rd operational brigade of the National Guard. Guys who successfully destroy enemy aircraft in Donetsk region. Thank you! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps us defend ourselves from the occupier! Thank you to everyone who strengthens our international positions and helps get weapons for Ukraine! Today, I spoke with the Minister of Defence of Poland in Kyiv – he, together with other partners and the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, took part in the third meeting of the states that are members of our tank coalition. We are doing everything to ensure that our soldiers receive modern tanks as soon as possible. And today, the United States announced another large package of defense support for our country. I thank President Biden, all friends of freedom in Congress, and every American for this tangible support! Now, we must work together to deliver this aid to Ukraine as quickly as possible. And one more. There are other sanctions decisions of the National Security and Defense Council of our country against those who work for Russian aggression. The decrees on the implementation of the decisions of the National Security and Defense Council have already been prepared. And separately, I thank the employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBI, the National Police, and the Prosecutor General's Office for taking new steps to restore justice after the actions of those who did not understand that in public positions one should work only for the interests of the state. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today, we have good news. Another 116 Ukrainians were released from Russian captivity. Of them, 114 are privates and sergeants, and two are officers. Soldiers of our army, the National Guard, territorial defense, Navy, border guards, and the State Emergency Service. We are constantly working to bring home all our people held in Russian captivity. And I'm happy every time it succeeds. I thank our entire team that prepares exchanges, the Coordinating Staff of the Defense Intelligence. Budanov, Usov, Yermak, Klymenko, Maliuk, Lubinets – I thank everyone! Thanks to everyone who helped. Of course, it is worth mentioning Denys Monastyrsky... He participated in preparing this exchange. And his death is really a big loss for our country. Since February 24, our team has managed to return totally 1,762 Ukrainian men and women from Russian captivity. I also thank all those involved in helping these people after their return. Everyone who treats, restores documents, helps solve problematic issues of those released from captivity. It reflects the basic meaning of what we do. We restore and protect the normality of life for our people in a free country. I spoke today with Rishi Sunak, Mr. Prime Minister of the UK. A very important conversation. We prepare pivotal things with him. I thanked the Prime Minister and all the British people for helping our country. Now, in the UK, our guys have already started training on Challenger tanks. It's a good vehicle. And it will be a big thing on the battlefield. Together with our partners, we do everything daily to ensure that our soldiers have sufficient strength to defend against the terrorist state. We also discussed other promising things that can strengthen our defense. The issue of the threat to the international Olympic movement, which arose due to the weakness of the international sports bureaucracy, due to those who are trying to actually allow Russia to use sports for propaganda, was separately touched upon. I am glad that the world hears our position that the Olympic principles must be unequivocally protected from the terrorist state. Today, I signed the relevant documents to take another step to protect and cleanse our state from those on the side of the aggressor. There is a request from the Security Service regarding persons with records that they have Russian citizenship. Tomorrow, another legal step will be taken to implement the sanctions decisions of the NSDC. And we are working to synchronize our sanctions decisions with partner jurisdictions. The enemies of the free world have no right to use the free world for their own interests. And one more thing. During the 346 days of this war, I often had to say that the situation at the front was tough. And that the situation is getting tougher. Now is that time again. A time when the occupier throws more and more of its forces to break our defenses. Now, it is very difficult in Bakhmut, Vuhledar, near Lyman, and other directions. But now, as every day of these 346, the resilience of our soldiers decides everything. Our resilience! It's not about the efforts and plans of Russia. It's about the courage and determination of our soldiers. The effectiveness and speed of all who support and help to support our defense forces. The attentiveness and persuasiveness of all those who defend Ukraine's international positions. The strength and unity of our people – all those who work for our victory, and all those who support our heroes and the Ukrainian state. To preserve all elements of our resilience is to guarantee victory. Glory to all our soldiers! Thanks to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we have another sanctions step by our country against the terrorist state. The NSDC decision on sanctions against Russia's nuclear industry has been put into effect. This is not the last decision regarding this industry of theirs. The point of our steps is also to bolster the efforts of our diplomats to extend global sanctions to this part of the Russian aggression machine. Russia is the only country in the world that allows its military to shell nuclear power plants and use NPPs as a cover for shelling. Russian missiles have repeatedly followed trajectories over Ukraine's nuclear facilities. The terrorist state uses the nuclear industry as one of the elements of foreign expansion. To put pressure on other states. To create respective threats to the sovereignty of other states. All of these are sufficient reasons for Russia's nuclear industry to be subject to global sanctions. And we are working on this with our partners. We also continue our diplomatic marathon to prevent the Kremlin from using world sports and the Olympic movement for its propaganda. Representatives of a terrorist state should have no place at the Olympics and international tournaments. Ukraine has sent respective letters to the companies that support the International Olympic Committee the most. These are large international companies that are definitely interested in ensuring that their reputation and support are not used for war propaganda. We have already begun preparing for the events of the coming week, which could become quite significant. We are preparing decisions and negotiations that should strengthen our warriors, provide Ukraine with more international support and more weapons. Both public and non-public formats of work are planned. I would like to express my special gratitude to those involved in the recovery from the power accident in the Odesa region. Restoration works are ongoing around the clock. As of today, hundreds of thousands of people in the Odesa region are without electricity supply. And of course, before the Russian terror, there were no such problems with electricity in Odesa and other regions of the country. Now, extraordinary efforts are needed to ensure the normal operation of the energy system. I am grateful to the power engineers, repairmen, officials - each and every one who is working to restore normal technical capabilities of electricity supply and to preserve our generation. By the way, this week we have reached some important agreements with our partners regarding our energy sector. In particular, the European Union is willing to support Ukraine with electricity supplies. I thank our partners for this. We are also stepping up cooperation in the supply of energy equipment. We also have extremely successful examples of energy saving initiatives. For example, just this week alone, people have already received the first million of LED lamps in exchange for energy-consuming incandescent lamps. More than 800 thousand applications under this program are already in Diia, which means it is as convenient as possible. When we fully implement the program - which is 30 million LED lamps - it will result in significant savings in consumption. I am thankful to Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, for supporting this initiative. Separately about the frontline. There are already many reports that the occupiers want to do something symbolic in February. To try to avenge their last year's defeats. We see this increased pressure in various areas of the frontline, as well as pressure in the information field. It is very difficult in the Donetsk region - there are fierce battles. But no matter how hard it is and no matter how much pressure there is, we have to withstand it. We have to use and we do use every day and every week to reinforce our defense at the front, to strengthen our international position, to increase pressure on Russia and to give our people new opportunities to get through this difficult time. We have no alternative but to defend ourselves and win. I am grateful to each and everyone who is focused on strengthening the state! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps our state! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. There are many issues. The key is actions on the frontline. In the Donetsk region and other directions. Particular attention is paid to Bakhmut. To our defense. To the occupier's attempts to surround the city and break the defense there. We are countering them. I am grateful to every warrior who ensures counteraction with his resilience! Today, I would like to commend the warriors of the 54th and 93rd separate mechanized brigades, the 15th separate battalion of the 128th mountain assault brigade. Thank you, warriors, for your bravery and steadfastness! For the resilience Ukraine needs so much. Today at the meeting of the Staff we also discussed the supply of ammunition to our warriors. Artillery is one of the key factors. As always, the Commander-in-Chief and the commanders of the directions delivered reports. The head of intelligence reported on the occupier's current plans. We are also strengthening our management positions. In a number of regions - especially in the border and frontline regions - we are appointing managers with military experience. Those who can prove themselves in the most effective way in the defense against the current threats. I will inform you about each such decision. In general, it is worth noting that we will combine the experience gained by our people in defending Ukraine - military experience - with specific managerial work in positions in local and central government. Today I have heard reports on the situation in Odesa and the region - the one related to the liquidation of the consequences of the energy accident. All services, all officials are working, everyone is involved. The repair work has already yielded part of the required result, and generators and power equipment are being delivered to the region and the city. As of now, there are power outages in a large part of the Odesa region. We are doing everything we can to provide electricity to people. Once again, I thank each and every person involved in this work. Today we have very tragic news from Türkiye and Syria. There was a powerful earthquake there. There are many casualties. Thousands of homes have been destroyed. My sincere condolences to Mr. President of Türkiye Erdoğan, as well as to those in Syrian society who have lost loved ones, who have lost their homes. Ukraine immediately responded and offered Türkiye support in the rescue operation. And one more thing. The formation of new brigades of the National Guard, police, and border guards - the Offensive Guard - continues. The beginning is powerful. The process will be continued. I thank everyone who has shown interest in the formation of brigades. I thank everyone who has applied! Good motivation plus good training equals the ability of our defense and security forces to regain what belongs to Ukraine. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to each and every one who works for our country! Glory to everyone who helps! Today, by the way, we have a very important decision from Norway - the five-year aid package for our country in the amount of NOK 75 billion. This is an extremely significant contribution to our victory, which we are preparing. A joint victory of all those who really value freedom and value life. I thank all Norwegians and Mr. Prime Minister personally! Thank you to all our partners! Thank you, people of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report on this day - another day of our defense. First. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has approved the new Head of the Security Service of Ukraine on my submission. I consider such a path to the appointment a signal to all government officials and employees of our law enforcement agencies. Vasyl Malyuk has been the Acting Head of the Service for some time. He passed the test of war. He proved his effectiveness. He was appointed. I am grateful to the people’s deputies of Ukraine for their positive vote on the candidacy of Ihor Klymenko for the post of Minister of Internal Affairs. It is important that the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is an element of the overall defense and security system, has quickly received a leader who has been defending our country since the first minutes of the full-scale invasion together with everyone else. Now we have people who have gained experience in such a war. They have clear results in their work for the state that is fighting for its people and its independence. There should be more such people on posts of various levels in central and local government. The relevant appointments have been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regional administrations will be headed by specialists who have real experience in defending the state right now. Today I met with the German Minister of Defense, who has arrived in Kyiv. The topic of our conversation is obvious. We are doing everything for our skies to be clear, for our warriors to have powerful tanks and for our artillery not to be inferior to that of the occupier. I thank Germany and all partners for the respective support. Today, as usual, I held several meetings with the military and a meeting with the head of intelligence. We are paying maximum attention to what the occupiers are preparing. And to what our warriors need to effectively resist – in all directions. The Donetsk region and the east, where the situation is the hottest – I mention them every day in such addresses. The south sounds less often, although the strategic meaning of these directions is no less significant. And we are strengthening the state along the entire perimeter. And today I want to praise the warriors in two directions. Our border guards who are fighting in Donbas. For their daily bravery and resilience in battles. For the results. Luhansk and Kharkiv border guard detachments - I thank you guys! I am thankful to all our defenders who defend the north of our country! Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Volyn. Operational and Strategic Group \"North\". Every direction matters. We are working on all enemy scenarios. We are defending the state. Today I met with the ambassadors of our United24 charity platform - our athlete Elina Svitolina and French director Michel Hazanavicius. Michel has joined the ambassadors and will help us with rebuilding. This is our first United24 voice in France, and I believe it will be a powerful one. I was pleased to hear that our state charity platform has already managed to accumulate almost $300 million from ordinary people and companies from over a hundred countries. I spoke with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. I expressed my condolences. I told him about our steps to help the people of Türkiye pull through this ordeal. Ukrainian rescuers have already left for Türkiye to bolster the rescue operation after the earthquakes. I hope they will be able to save as many lives as possible. Thank you to everyone who saves lives! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "The people of the United Kingdom and their honorable representatives! All the people of England and Scotland, of Wales and Northern Ireland! Of all the lands which have been home to brave souls since Europe came into existence! I have come here and stand before you on behalf of the Brave. On behalf of our warriors who are now in the trenches under enemy artillery fire. On behalf of our air gunners and every defender of the sky who protects Ukraine against enemy aircrafts and missiles. On behalf of our tank-men who fight to restore our Ukrainian border. On behalf of our conscripts who are being trained now, including here in Britain. Thank you, Britain! And who will be then deployed to the frontline – skilled, equipped and eager to win. On behalf of every father and every mother who are waiting for their brave sons and brave daughters back home from the war. Mister Speaker! You may well remember as roughly more than two years ago we met with you here in the Parliament. It was a great honor for me. We enjoyed tea, we talked a lot about our people, our countries, the British and Ukrainian political traditions. Mister Prime Minister! Rishi! When we had our meeting earlier today, I said to you I would tell a story in my address to the Parliament. A story about my feelings on my first visit to London as president in autumn 2020. The programme was packed. Royal Highnesses William and Catherine. Buckingham Palace. The aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy. Westminster. Downing Street. And, of course, the War Rooms. There is an armchair in the war room. The famous Churchill’s armchair. A guide smiled and offered me to sit down on the armchair from which war orders had been given. He asked me – how did I feel? And I said that I certainly felt something. But it is only now that I know what the feeling was. And all Ukrainians know it perfectly well, too. It is the feeling of how bravery takes-you-through the most unimaginable hardships – to finally reward you with Victory. Ladies and Gentlemen! I thank you for your bravery. Thank you very much from all of us! This applause is for you! London has stood with Kyiv since day one. From the first seconds and minutes of the full scale war. Great Britain, you extended your helping-hand when the world had not yet come to understand how to react. Boris, you got others united when it seemed absolutely impossible. Thank you! You all showed your grit and character back then. Strong British character. You didn't compromise Ukraine. And hence you didn't compromise your ideals. And thus you didn't compromise the spirit of these great Islands. Thank you very much! Our countries knew different times. Our nations defended freedom in the Second World War. The iron curtain divided us. Our people went through crises and growth, inflation, and periods of social losses and social gains. It was tough but we always found strength and stamina to move ahead and achieve results. This is the bedrock of our and your traditions. Ukrainians and Brits defeated the fear of war and had the time to enjoy peace. No matter what we encountered on different stages of our and your formidable history, you and us and the whole mankind achieved similar result – evil lost. We will always come out on top of evil. This lies at the core of our – but also your – traditions. However, the horizon never stays clear for a while. Once the old evil is defeated, the new one is attempting to rise its head. Do you have a feeling that the evil will crumble once again? I can see it in your eyes now. We think the same way as you do. We know freedom will win. We know Russia will lose. We know the Victory will change the world! And this will be a change that the world has long needed. The United Kingdom is marching with us towards the most important victory of our lifetime. It will be a victory over the very idea of the war. After we win together, any aggressor – big or small – will know what awaits him if he attacks international order. Any aggressor who will try to push the boundaries by force. Who will inflict destruction and death on other peoples. Who will try to endure his dictatorship at the expense of other people's blood in criminal and unprovoked wars, as the Kremlin does. Any aggressor is going to lose. Ladies and Gentlemen! We have already achieved remarkable results. And we must make every effort to turn our achievements into the foundations of the future global security architecture. The world needs your leadership, Britain, just as it needs Ukrainian bravery. When the full-scale invasion began, we, together with you and the US and other allies, formed a true coalition of friends. This is very important. You were among those very few who had helped before the large-scale invasion began – exactly as it will be necessary every time in the future to prevent aggression from happening. Your help was preventive. We must take these principles of preventive aid to those, who are threatened with aggression, and preventive sanctions – against those, who threaten aggression – as basic principles of the world anti-war policy. We created a coalition of NLAW and Javelin that stopped the advance of the Russian army from the first day of the invasion. We built a coalition of artillery rounds and a coalition of air defense, which allow us to save the lives of civilians, our women, children and elderly, in our cities from Russian atrocious occupation and missile terror. We put together a powerful sanctions coalition. Your leadership in protecting international legal order through sanctions against a terrorist state – cannot be questioned. And we have to steadily continue along this way until Russia is deprived of any possibility to finance the war. Most importantly, together with the G7 we brought about a coalition of values. A coalition that protects the rule-based world order and human rights.  A coalition that will work in such a way, that over time there will simply be no gray areas in the world in which human life does not matter. In order for it to be so, there must be justice. Anyone who invests in terror must be held accountable. Anyone who invests in violence must compensate those who have suffered from terror, aggression or other forms of state violence. Our proposals for the creation of a Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine and a Special Compensation Mechanism, which will compensate war losses at the expense of Russian assets, are based on such principles. Justice is one of the ten elements of the Peace Formula proposed by Ukraine and supported by Britain. I thank you for your readiness to invoke the Formula!  As I already mentioned, Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in Britain. In particular, to operate \"Challengers\", your main battle tanks. It’s a tank coalition in action, and I thank you, Rishi, for this powerful defensive step - for tank assistance. The coalition of long-range missiles is the latest of all. It will allow us to make the evil completely retreat from our country by destroying its hideaways deep in the occupied territories. And it's not just about weapons. We proved together that the world truly helps those who are brave in defending freedom. And thus, paves the way for a new history. A history of a world that knows how to be quick in help. Who knows how to be effective in defense. Who knows how to remain principled in dark hours. Who implements its treaties and arrangements in good faith. Who does not allow perpetrators to enjoy impunity. Who knows how to overcome veto when it is abused. Who knows no fear. And who knows how to win. This shall be the new reality of the free world! I’m sure of that. However, evil is still around today and the battle continues. Yes, we know how it is going to end and how we are going to feel on the day victory comes. Everyday we continue to pay with lives, pain and tears for bringing the victory closer. With the lives of our heroes, whom we lose in battles. With the lives of our heroes who take life and death risks every day to save as many of our soldiers and civilians as possible. Today, I will have the honor to be received by His Majesty the King. It will be a truly special moment for me. In particular, because I will convey to him from all the Ukrainians the words of gratitude for the support His Majesty showed to them when he was still the Prince of Wales. I also intend to tell him something that is very important not only for the future of Ukraine but also for the future of Europe. In Britain, the King is an air force pilot. And in Ukraine today, every air force pilot is the king for us, for our families. Because they are so few, they are so precious that we, the servants of our kings, do everything possible and impossible to make the world provide us with modern planes to empower and protect pilots who will be protecting us. I am proud of our air force. And I brought a present from them to you, Great Britain. Open, please. I will explain. It's the helmet of a real Ukrainian pilot. He is one of our most successful aces. He is one of our kings. And the writing on the helmet reads: \"We have freedom. Give us wings to protect it.\" I trust this symbol will help us form our next coalition – coalition of the planes. I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet most important words: Combat aircrafts – for Ukraine! Wings – for freedom! Great Britain! You and us both struggle for peace, but instead we are forced to face the rage that seeks to deprive us of peace and everything else that is valuable in life. Unfortunately, it is in human nature to allow evil mature. It then stands up against humanity. It then destroys and kills. It launches aggressions and breaks people's lives. You and us have already fought together against such evil. You and us already have the experience of defeating the evil that is generated by human nature. I am not saying there will be no more wars after this war ends. It is impossible to completely erase evil from human nature. Yet, it is in our power to guarantee with words and deeds that the light side of human nature will prevail. The side you and us share. And this stands above anything else. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Leaving the British Parliament two years ago, I thanked you for delicious English tea. I will be leaving the parliament today thanking all of you in advance – for powerful English planes. By the way, it's almost five o'clock. God bless Great Britain and long live the King!"

  "speech": "Dear Mrs. President, dear Roberta! I thank you for these powerful words and I thank you for your personal attention, an extremely important attention for Ukraine. I thank you for your integrity and energy, two qualities that we see invariably in the current struggle for Europe and whose combination is always a prerequisite for progress. Europe is fortunate that in this hall, in the largest parliament in Europe, the European Parliament, principled and energetic people are an absolute majority. I thank you. Dear representatives of Europe! Dear leaders of Europe! All of us, Europeans, each and every one of the hundreds of millions of people on our continent, combine these two statuses - representatives of Europe and leaders of Europe. This combination reflects what our Europe, a modern Europe, a peaceful Europe, gives to the world. European way of life. European path of life. European manner of life. European rules of life.  When everyone matters. When the law rules. When states strive to be social and societies strive to be open. When diversity is a value and the values of the different are united by fair equality. When the borders are inviolable, but their crossing is not felt. When people believe in tomorrow and are willing to take to the streets to fight for their tomorrow. When there is only one single barrier between the president and the protesters, and that is fair elections. This is our Europe. These are our rules. This is our way of life. And for Ukraine, it's a way home. Now I am here to protect the way home for our people. All Ukrainian men, all Ukrainian women. Of different ages and different political beliefs, different social status, different views on religion, with different personal stories, but common European history with all of you. There is an attempt to destroy the Ukrainian European way of life by all-out war. But what for? For the destruction of the European way of life as such after the Ukrainian European way of life is destroyed. For each of all twenty-seven elements of the European way of life. The twenty-seven countries of the European Union. We will not allow that. This total war that has been unleashed by Russia is not just about territory in one part of Europe or another. Its threat is not only in the fact that there is a dictator with huge stockpiles of Soviet weapons and weapons inflow from other dictatorships, in particular the Iranian regime. In order to be able to wage this war, the Kremlin has been consistently destroying, step by step, year after year, what we see as the basis of our Europe. The sacred value of human life has been completely destroyed in Russia as well. No one matters to the authorities there, except those inside the Kremlin walls, their relatives and their wallets. For them, for the Kremlin, all others, all one hundred and forty million citizens are just bodies capable of carrying weapons - carrying weapons to Ukraine, carrying weapons on the battlefield, keeping others in line or being in line themselves. The rule of violence and obedience are the rules there instead of law. The Russian regime not only hates everything, any sociality and any diversity, but also deliberately invests in xenophobia and tries to make all the inhuman things that happened in the 1930s and 1940s part of the norm on our continent. But will it last forever? This is a question for all of us. The answer is no! No! Europe! We are defending ourselves against the most anti-European force in the modern world. We are defending ourselves. We, Ukrainians, are on the battlefield with you. I thank you for the fact that we are defending ourselves together! And we must defend ourselves! And this is important not only for European countries. Not only for the communities of Europe. No matter who we are, we always fight against contempt. Wherever we live, we always rely on good faith. Whatever we dream of for our children, for our grandchildren, the unconditional background for these dreams is peace - peace and security. Will all of this be possible if we do not defeat the anti-European force that seeks to steal Europe from us, from all of us? No. It is only our victory that will guarantee all of this - each of our common European values. Our imperative victory! Dear representatives of Europe! Dear leaders of Europe! Dear ladies and gentlemen of the parliament! Dear employees of the European Parliament and other European institutions! Dear journalists! Dear security officials, military! Police officers, rescuers! Dear municipal employees! Diplomats! Teachers! Professors! Scientists! Dear doctors, drivers and port workers! Farmers! Dear industrialists and workers of industrial enterprises! Owners of small and large businesses, banks! Dear power engineers and railway workers! Dear students, pupils! Trade union activists, representatives of non-governmental organizations! Dear directors and artists! Lawyers, judges, environmentalists, human rights activists! The fate of Europe has never depended on politicians alone. There should be no such illusion now as well. Each and every one of you is important. Each and every one of you is strong. Each and every one of you can influence our common result. Our common victory. This applause is definitely not for me. This applause is for gratitude – I want to thank everyone in Europe, in hundreds of cities and towns, who supported Ukraine in this historic struggle. Thank you! I want to thank you - everyone who has helped our people, our ordinary people, our displaced persons. Those who called on their leaders to increase support for the protection of these ordinary people. Who took to the streets, who asked questions, who spread the truth about Russian aggression. Who refrained from the temptations of Russian disinformation and who stand with us in the fight for life. In the fight for Europe. I thank you! I thank everyone who is helping Ukraine with vital supplies. Weapons and ammunition. Energy equipment and fuel. Thousands of things that are essential to survive this all-out war. I thank you, dear ladies and gentlemen of the parliament, and you personally, Roberta, for consistently defending the European way of life with your decisions. For consistently defending the Ukrainian European way of life. You have made bold decisions and strengthened the European ambition to be the home of justice and freedom. I recall the first days of the full-scale invasion, when Russia's ambition to break us and the whole of Europe was still audacious. When Russian aggression was just beginning to break its teeth on our defense. Already then, on March 1, on the sixth day of the full-scale war, the European Parliament adopted a resolution supporting not just our country, but the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union for our country. It was a vision that motivated us to be resilient and stay on our path. Thank you. Today, at a meeting of the European Council, I will have the opportunity to personally thank the heads of state and government of Europe, whose decisions over the past year have allowed our continent to do what the previous wave of leaders thought impossible. Europe is finally freeing itself from destructive dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Europe is cleaning itself of the corrupt influence of Russian oligarchic business. Europe is defending itself against the infiltration of agents of the Russian special services, who have even considered Europe as a place to hunt for opponents of the Russian dictatorship already. For the first time in its history, the European Union is providing military assistance of such magnitude. And for the first time in history, I believe, it is preparing a positive assessment of internal reforms in a European country that is defending itself in this all-out war and at the same time - while fighting - modernizing its institutions. We are getting closer to the European Union. Ukraine will be a member of the European Union! A victorious Ukraine! A member of the European Union - a victorious European Union! Dear friends! Perhaps some of you have not experienced the full power of the European way of life before. But now, together, Ukraine and the EU countries have made our power evident. Why is this possible? Because we combine integrity and energy. We are all equal in representing Europe, and we are diligent as each of us is a leader of Europe in our own particular life. We do not rely on words - we act. We do not cower before the enemy - we stand. We do not waste time - we change ourselves and we implement changes. Europe will always remain free. As long as we are together and as long as we care about our Europe! Care about the European way of life. I thank you all! I invite you all to Ukraine! Glory to all Ukrainian men and Ukrainian women who are in combat! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Mr. President, Charles! Dear colleagues! Ladies and gentlemen, presidents and heads of government of Europe! I am happy to greet you all personally and to thank you all personally for your support for Ukraine, our people and our aspirations. The aspirations to live freely in a united Europe. I will repeat these words once again: freely and in a united Europe. It may sound routine and familiar somewhere. And somewhere else it means something completely different. I want to tell you now about just one episode. I think it is important. One of the many episodes of current life on our continent. Each of these episodes is designed to deprive us both of these fundamental characteristics. Freely and in a united Europe. I recently spoke with the President of Moldova, Mrs. Sandu. I informed her about what our intelligence has managed to intercept. A detailed Russian plan to undermine the political situation in Moldova. A Russian document that shows who, when and through what actions was going to break Moldova. To break the democratic order of this country and establish their control over it. I did not hesitate for a single minute when I received this document and heard about its origin. I immediately warned about all these threats. I warned Moldova to protect it. And each of you would have done the same, each of you. We don't know whether Moscow gave an order to act according to this plan against Moldova. But we saw what they were going to do, and we recognized it as exactly what they had already tried to do against Ukraine and against other states, particularly in Europe. There is nothing new. You have seen other attempts at such Russian subversive and destabilizing activities. We, my friends, are protecting Europe from a regime that has proven that it has only one ambition: to destroy Europe's freedom and to be an authoritarian master on the continent. Yes, for this regime, our common European home is just a space, just a territory with resources and assets that can be allegedly conquered or otherwise brought under control. So that they can dominate wherever they want and plunder or exploit whatever they want. Aggression, deliberate mockery of nations or artificially provoked crises... Russian air strikes or Russian disinformation attacks... Russian politicians or saboteurs... Russian dirty money and corrupt influence... Attempts to undermine the political or economic situation... Missile attacks, cyber attacks... Isn't it too much? Russia has different tools. And these tools are not only against Ukraine, Moldova, the Baltic States, Poland, or those neighboring Russia. We saw this, in particular, in the Balkans. Unfortunately, we can see it again any time in any region of Europe, if someone in Moscow comes up with an idea to draw up another illegal violent or aggressive plan. A plan for new aggression - hybrid or direct. Will we always have time to defend ourselves? This is my question. We all need speed in decision-making and reliability! Dear colleagues! Here in Brussels, and in the European Union as a whole, everyone can feel the weight of two personalities. Everyone can understand why everyone respects Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet so much. In particular, their leadership created our current freedom and allowed Europe to become as united as we have long dreamed of. Now we need to add one component to our freedom and unity. A component without which everything else is fragile. This component is security. And if we manage to provide Europe with the security it needs right now and guarantee its reliability and durability, your names, colleagues, will be written in the history of Europe alongside the names of Schuman and Monnet. The European Union is already on the way to such security! Fundamental steps have already been taken. But we have to go all the way! I know we can do it. I thank each and every one for consistently becoming stronger during this terrible year, when Russian aggression has become the most intense. Europe is getting stronger thanks to your actions and decisions. And even when there were hesitations and disputes, you still found the possibility of these joint decisions. Strong decisions! I thank you for them. I thank you for understanding that there should be no gray areas anywhere in Europe. Not a single part of our continent that for some reason is closed off from the common European destiny. Which for some reason is left in danger. The course of further European unification is a fundamental security course. A free Europe today cannot be imagined without a free Ukraine. I thank you for the fact that we have jointly prepared Ukraine's acquisition of the status of candidate for accession to the European Union. I thank you for jointly preparing a positive assessment of our transformation on the way to the European Union. I thank you for the fact that the launch of negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union this year will become another strong pillar of our common security. For the first time in its history, the European Union is providing such large-scale and consistent military assistance as we are receiving. Together with the appropriate leadership at the level of member states, this security interaction with Ukraine has created a historical example for any aggressor. An example of why one should not start aggression against Europeans. That is why Russian aggression must inevitably fail. As soon as possible! The sooner and stronger the return of freedom and the real power of European values to the entire territory of Ukraine, which remains occupied by Russia, is, the more reliable and lasting peace in postwar Europe will be. And I am grateful to all of you who help us. I am grateful to all of you who understand how much Ukraine needs such capabilities, artillery and ammunition, modern tanks, long-range missiles, and modern aircraft. And I am grateful to all of you who provide such military assistance! We must strengthen the dynamics of our cooperation more than the aggressor can mobilize its potential. I am grateful to every nation of Europe who feels that the Ukrainian people and the heroic Ukrainian warriors on the frontline, with appropriate support, are able to destroy the terror that Russia is carrying and any aggression, any aggressive actions against people and against Europe. I am grateful to you for your economic and energy solidarity. For helping us to maintain financial and social stability in Ukraine - even in such difficult conditions of a full-scale war. I thank you for all the financial and energy assistance packages you have provided us. And this is also about security. Not only the security of our people. It is about the security of the entire European community. Finally, Russian energy carriers will never again be a weapon against Europe. Finally, everyone in Europe saw how Russia really treats Europeans and the energy system on the continent, our markets, and our finances. For the Kremlin, all this is just an opportunity to wage wars. I thank you for your determination to gradually deprive the Kremlin of such aggressive capabilities. I thank you for the sanctions packages that have already come into force. But have they sufficiently limited Russia's aggressive potential? This is a path that needs to be completed. We can analyze how these sanctions are working. So that they have neither the opportunity nor the desire to make efforts to destabilize any country in Europe or elsewhere. Or to provoke any crises – energy, migrant, you can see what is happening with grain, i.e. food crises, radiation crises. Think about it: Russia has created the threat of a radiation catastrophe in Europe! And the Russian nuclear industry is still free from global sanctions. Is this normal? I do not think so. There are steps that still need to be taken. For example, sanctions against the entire Russian missile and drone industry, the relevant part of the IT sector of the terrorist state. After all, Russian missile and drone terror will remain a threat until the source of the threat is destroyed. I believe Europe has this determination. And the last thing. Without which the kind of Europe we are defending is impossible. Justice. It is impossible to live without justice, and you do not see any future in this. There must be a tribunal against Russia for this aggression. There must be a compensation mechanism for all the damage caused by Russian terror. There must be fair accountability for Russian terrorists for everything they have done - from the destruction of the Malaysian Boeing in the skies over Donbas in 2014 to every other manifestation of this appalling terror. Thousands of victims of Russian terror and the memory of thousands of our warriors who gave their lives fighting this terror demand justice. When it is ensured, it will be another part of the security foundation of a peaceful Europe. Dear colleagues! Everything I have said today is already part of our Peace Formula or directly corresponds to it. Ukraine never wanted this war, never sought this or any other war. Ukraine never provoked it and always tried to maintain peace. You know this very well. History knows this very well. You know the potential of our Formula and our unity. I urge you to realize this potential to the fullest! Europe is free and will be free. Europe is united, and I am sure that we must do everything to make sure that Europe is united with an independent Ukraine, with an independent Moldova, with an independent Georgia, with independent Baltic states, with Poland and with all the other states that are members of our modern Europe. We must guarantee security to all European countries! Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Fellow Ukrainians! A brief report. Today, the enemy launched at least 70 missiles in another massive attack. At least 60 missiles were shot down. Their targets were civilians, civilian infrastructure. Unfortunately, there were hits. Unfortunately, there are victims. My condolences to the relatives and friends! Several Russian missiles flew through the airspace of Moldova and Romania. Another proof that terror does not know and will never know any borders. Another proof that the protection of Ukraine is the protection of the whole of Europe and the world, of every country that simply wants to live. Today's missiles are a challenge to NATO, collective security. This is terror that can and must be stopped. Stopped by the world. And I thank everyone who understands this. I thank everyone who helps. And, of course, I thank our Air Forces, all our anti-aircraft fighters, everyone who protects Ukraine and our people. Another air alert is currently underway. And please pay attention to the alarms. Please stay tuned for official information. Take care of yourselves. We will defeat everyone! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Our team had a very good visit to Great Britain. Then we had very good meetings in the EU and Brussels with all our partners. Thank you very much for your support and all your words and deeds since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia. But we have challenges every day. Ladies and Gentlemen! Another missile attack on our country has just taken place. This is our morning today. At least sixty-five rockets. All – against civilian infrastructure. This follows a night of air raid alert. Before this morning missile strike – an attack with deadly drones and rockets too. Their targets were power plants and power transformers – that is, the basis of normal life of people. Energy. If the Olympic sports were killings and missile strikes, then you know which national team would occupy the first place. And it's not important – whether this national team would have its official flag, the state tricolor. Russian terrorists use different symbolics. The Russian military forced Ukrainians in the occupied territory of our country to wear a white armband. Allegedly not to be killed. But they were tortured and killed even with these white armbands. Russia uses certain letters of the Latin alphabet on flags of different colors – and all of them symbolize the genocidal ideology of rashism, whatever the specific color is used. It also happens that the Russian occupiers destroy normal life without any symbols at all – this is how the Russian aggression began. Our Crimean peninsula was occupied by Russian soldiers without any insignia. So, I want to ask you: if representatives of a terrorist state appear at international sports competitions or the Olympic Games, will it matter if they are there without their national symbols? The mere presence of representatives of the terrorist state is a manifestation of violence and lawlessness. Dear friends! I know you do not want to allow the Olympic principles to be distorted. It is a fundamental thing for Ukraine and, I believe, for each of your states – to protect the value basis of normal life that we cherish with you. Peaceful life! A life based on respect for different people. The Russian state has chosen the path of terror, and that is why it has no place in the civilized world. The world isolated Russia. To be protected. The Russian presence is being removed. To encourage an end to aggression and terror. This is the self-defense of the world – a world that takes care of its values and protects life. 228 Ukrainian athletes and coaches died during the year of Russian aggression against Ukraine! 228! And how many Russian athletes have spoken out to condemn the terror unleashed by their state? In fact, there is almost no such condemnation. There are only a few isolated voices that are quickly fading away. We know that many Russian athletes associated with the sport clubs of the Russian army and of security state agencies. Including athletes who applied for championships and the Olympic Games. We are aware that many Russian athletes have a military or other special rank. We know that Russia is trying to use any attention of the world to the Russians for war propaganda. If, God forbid, the Olympic principles are destroyed and Russian athletes are allowed to participate in any competitions or the Olympic Games, it's just a matter of time – before the terrorist state forces them to play along with the war propaganda. Ladies and Gentlemen! Sports community! Each of us knows what the Olympic principles are. Terror and Olympism are two opposites. They cannot be combined. Probably someone wants the \"Schröderization\" of sports and the presence of a terrorist state – in one form or another – on the world's sports fields. Probably someone wants to disregard the Olympic spirit in order to help Russia by manipulating the mere letter of the Olympic principles. However, we must protect life. We must protect our values. We must stop aggression and fight against those who choose the road of terrorism. We must safeguard the Olympic movement. I believe that we will! Ukraine has launched a marathon of honesty, and I urge you to join. While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of the terrorist state have no place at sports and Olympic competitions. And it cannot be covered up with some pretended neutrality or a white flag. Because Russia is now a country that stains everything with blood – even the white flag. It must be recognized. And this must be recognized, in particular, at the level of the International Olympic Committee. The International Olympic Committee needs honesty. Honesty it has unfortunately lost. Honesty that will help stop Russian terror and bring peace closer. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Let life win!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! The fifth day of this week is coming to an end. In some ways, a very hard week, but a very meaningful one for sure. I want to emphasize a few things after the results of this week. He held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. It was a busy meeting. The situation on the front line was examined in detail, in particular in Donetsk region –Bakhmut and other hot spots. Tough areas. We reviewed the situation with the supply of weapons, the general situation with the defense of the state at the Staff meeting. We are already preparing for the new \"Ramstein\" – in particular, we talked about it. About new defense options that we should open for Ukraine together with our partners. The second important thing this week is our diplomatic marathon. London, Paris, Brussels – everywhere these days I spoke about how to strengthen our troops. There are very important agreements and we have received good signals. This applies both to long-range missiles and tanks, and to the next level of our cooperation – combat aircraft. But we still need to work on this. I was very pleased to hear and see that our boys in the UK are rapidly learning to drive the Challengers. I was very happy to see how eager the British were for us to win. All this is inspiring. I am grateful to the Prime Minister, the British Parliament and all British people. And, of course, His Majesty the King. A fundamental meeting was held in France with President Macron and Chancellor Scholz. The three of us had a conversation, and it's the right conversation. It's wrong to disclose its details, but we can say we heard each other. France – Ukraine, Germany – Ukraine. Partners have heard our position, our arguments. There will be more support. And I thank Mr. President and all the French, Mr. Chancellor and all Germans for that. Understanding that the protection of Ukraine is the protection of the interests and our partners is felt. Brussels. The meeting of the European Council and our special format of negotiations after the meeting. The negotiations with EU leaders not only within the framework of the European Council, but also within the framework of ad hoc meetings that took place after the summit. In general, I met with all the leaders of the European Union. And now, our joint task is to take all that we talked about and agreed upon and transform it into concrete delivery, concrete documents, and concrete new lines of cooperation. The third is the European Parliament. It was not just my address as the President of Ukraine, but it was a symbolic moment. A certain valuable summary of the path we have taken in relations with the European Union. And the beginning of the new stage. When Ukraine is no longer a guest or partner from outside the EU in the European Parliament, the European Council and other institutions of the European Union. When Ukraine becomes a full part of the European Union. This week I said many words of gratitude to our allies and partners – everyone who helps us. And now I want to say words of gratitude to you, Ukrainians. It is always an honor for me to represent Ukraine, and I am proud of our beautiful and strong people. You have heard and seen how Ukraine is welcomed. It's what we all did together. It's how you are welcomed. I'm proud of Ukrainian courage. I'm proud of Ukrainian resilience. I'm proud of Ukrainian effectiveness. I'm proud of all of you who fight and work for our country! Who supports the front and the state. Thanks to all of you! Of course, today, I want to mention our pilots, all our Air Force fighters, everyone who defends the Ukrainian sky. So far, unfortunately, we cannot shoot down all Russian missiles. But all those dozens of missiles that we shoot down every time during heavy airstrikes are hundreds of lives saved every time and it is saved infrastructure. That which gives life to the people. I thank you, Air Force! And we will do everything to ensure that you have modern and efficient wings! Historical results for Ukraine are always closer than they might seem. Glory to our troops! Glory to our beautiful people! Glory to everyone in the world who is determined to fight for freedom together with us! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians! Today, I started the day by visiting the Turkish Embassy. With condolences to the Turkish people after the terrible earthquakes. As of now, more than 21,000 dead are known. Debris removal continues. And, unfortunately, the death toll may be higher. The team of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine is currently working in Türkiye, helping with debris removal. The Embassy of Ukraine is finding out all the information about Ukrainians who could stay in the disaster zone. We share the pain of the Turkish people. And we wish all those affected a speedy recovery. In the afternoon, I held several meetings with representatives of the defense sector and law enforcement agencies. The topic is common to these meetings. It is the strengthening of the public institutions of Ukraine and the protection of institutions from any attempts from outside or inside to reduce their effectiveness and efficiency. This applies to various areas: both personnel policy, interaction between public institutions, and the clarity of how the public structures work. For example, at a meeting law enforcement officers presented a report on the detection and blocking of shadow schemes at customs. You have seen during these weeks appropriate investigative actions and detentions. The Security Service of Ukraine, the State Bureau of Investigations, and the Prosecutor General's Office have achieved significant results in protecting our country from those who worked for the aggressor state. There will be corresponding steps by the National Security and Defense Council, continuing our line of defense of the state. And all this activity is not only these or other episodes or these or other criminal proceedings. Not only what concerns certain individuals. And what concerns institutions. The state will continue modernizing the institutions, their processes and procedures. The clarity in the work of the public structures should be guaranteed not only by what depends on the people but also by the creation of transparency and accountability functionality. And I want to thank all the workers of our defense and security sector and all law enforcement officers who care about the state, who strengthen the state with their work, and who not only suggest how to enhance Ukrainian institutions but also give results in such strengthening. Of course, I want to thank our defenders of the sky for the result today. For another page of success in defending our state from Iranian drones used by Russia. I would especially like to mention the fighters of the 160th Odesa, 208th Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades, and the 302nd Kharkiv anti-aircraft missile regiment. Thank you guys! Thank you to all our soldiers for the latest results that Ukraine needs in terms of resistance and repelling enemy assaults in Donetsk region – near Bakhmut, Avdiyivka, and other directions. Thank you to the soldiers of the 80th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade, the 5th Separate Assault Regiment, the border guards, and the National Guardsmen, who are fighting together in Donetsk region. Air reconnaissance and intelligence, aviation, mortars, gunners, infantry, tankers, and anyone and everyone who helps. Thank you all! Glory to all who make Ukraine stronger, the enemy weaker, and our victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! This is another sanctions step by our state against the nuclear industry of the terrorist state. By my decree, I put into effect the decision of the National Security and Defense Council to impose sanctions on 200 people working for the Russian nuclear industry. We are doing everything to make sanctions against the Russian nuclear industry part of global sanctions against Russia for the war. It is not easy. There is some resistance. But there was a time when other restrictions against Russia seemed difficult to implement as well. They did. Now they are already in place. For example, on oil and oil products from Russia. All elements of the Russian system that are involved in the war, in providing terror and financing aggression must be isolated from the global system. This will be done! This is all the more true for those who participated in the seizure and illegal actions at our Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russia's radiation blackmail of the world must be punished. This is also something we will be discussing at various diplomatic levels next week. This will be an equally important week for our international positions. We are already preparing for the planned communications and negotiations. We will not interrupt the diplomatic marathon we have launched to strengthen armed and other support for Ukraine for a single week. Today I would like to personally praise everyone who is restoring the energy capabilities of our country. Today and yesterday, the majority of Ukrainians spent without many shutdowns. Of course, unfortunately, there were still restrictions in some districts and cities. Where the degree of destruction is too significant. Of course, with the start of the new week, consumption will increase, and therefore there will be outage schedules. But the very fact that we can have such calm days in terms of energy after the constant terrorist attacks with missiles and Shaheds, after the massive missile attack this week proves the professionalism of our power engineers and the extraordinary dedication of everyone who works on the provision of our energy system. I am grateful to all Ukrainian power engineers, all repair crews, employees of the State Emergency Service, utility workers, regional and local authorities who helped. And to the businesses that have been involved in the relevant work. We must realize that this is not yet a decisive victory on the energy front. Unfortunately, there may be new terrorist attacks from Russia. There may be new restrictions if there is new destruction and consumption growth. But today and yesterday are yet another proof that by working together and helping each other, Ukrainians are doing great things. So let's stay united! Do not waste a single day or a single week! All for the sake of Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who works for our country! Glory to each and every one who is in combat! Glory to all those who are defending Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Chasiv Yar, Maryinka, Avdiivka and all other directions in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as along the entire frontline! Resilience, unity and mutual support are our strength! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a very busy day - both in terms of domestic issues, primarily defense and security, and foreign policy. I held a meeting of the Staff. We heard reports from the direction commanders, the Commander-in-Chief, and intelligence chiefs. The defense of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the south of our country, Odesa and the region. Constant attention is paid to the supply of weapons, ammunition and everything that gives our warriors strength and resilience. Today I introduced the new heads of the Security Service of Ukraine and the Ministry of Internal Affairs - Vasyl Malyuk and Ihor Klymenko. I am confident that both of them are in the right place. Where they are really useful for the state. I thanked them for being at war from the first minutes of the war. Together with their colleagues. They have already achieved significant results in protecting the state, and they will definitely have even greater achievements in their new positions. Today I spoke with the Prime Minister of Norway. This country is one of our largest partners. I expressed gratitude for the new defense package and for the new unprecedented support program from Norway, which is being prepared for approval and will last 5 years - 5 years of stable support for Ukraine. Norway truly helps us strengthen ourselves on land, in the sky and at sea. Thousands of Ukrainian lives have been saved thanks to timely and powerful Norwegian assistance. But the energy, political and other support from our Norwegian friends is also important. Thank you again for all this help! I spoke with the President-elect of the Republic of Cyprus. I congratulated him on winning the election. We discussed the relations between our countries and agreed to work together for the sake of common security - of our countries and of the whole of Europe. I spoke today with the President of the Philippines for the first time in the history of bilateral relations. I thanked him for the support in international organizations, and we agreed to develop our relations. It is extremely important for Ukraine to have meaningful relations with the entire Southeast Asian region and with every country in the region. We will move on in this direction. In general, Ukrainian diplomacy has a clear task: to reach all regions of the world where our position is not yet well represented, to make Ukraine and Ukrainian interests understandable to all those states and nations with whom we do not yet have stable ties. This concerns Asian destinations, as well as Africa and Latin America. Today, I held a meeting with the international bloc of the government and the Office to discuss the interim results of our diplomatic marathon. Our activity is really high now. We reach new agreements almost every day. Last week was particularly intense. But the key thing is to ensure that each agreement reached turns into concrete supplies for our defense, concrete interaction between states and concrete signed documents as soon as possible. We have reached an important mutual understanding with the UK on long-range weapons and the need to speed up the delivery of tanks. We have a good agreement on artillery and ammunition. We have a full understanding of each other's positions on modern fighter jets. And I thank all our British friends, I thank Mr. Prime Minister Sunak for the work that has been started, particularly in the aviation sector. Our talks in Paris with President Macron and Chancellor Scholz were also significant. The three of us spoke very frankly, and this allowed us to find a common understanding of the prospects in this war. I think this will make it much easier to resolve defense issues. We have a common vision of the path to victory. I would also like to separately thank Mr. President and Mr. Chancellor for their consolidated support of our European integration. The visit to Brussels was unprecedented for the history of our relations with the European Union. For the first time, there was such attention to Ukraine, for the first time, there was a meeting with all European leaders at once, and a series of conversations with European leaders that were as dynamic, meaningful, and free of excessive politicization as possible. With each leader, we discussed only those things that are important for our relations and for the European community as a whole. There was not a single empty conversation. I thank all our partners for this. I would also like to emphasize the negotiations with Poland. With President Duda, when I was returning to Ukraine. And I had a separate conversation with Prime Minister Morawiecki in Brussels. We discussed tanks and other weapons for defense on the ground; aircraft and other means of defense in the sky. We discussed the situation in the region in general, the prospects for this year... As always, we have full understanding with our Polish brothers. And it is very important that we enjoy clear support from European institutions and European leaders for our goal of preparing for and starting negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the EU this year already. Now, more than ever, it feels like Ukraine's European goals are becoming a reality. Finally, there are more real achievements than political declarations. For decades, Ukraine and the European Union have been moving towards this. These weeks, our diplomatic marathon continues. Tomorrow is another Ramstein. We are preparing for it. And we are working to ensure that all our negotiations are reflected in the defense decisions of our partners both at Ramstein and during the time period before February 24. New bilateral talks and meetings are also planned. We are preparing. And we are making this intensity of diplomatic work the new minimum standard for Ukraine. I thank everyone who works for our country! I thank everyone who helps! I thank everyone who is in combat! I thank all our warriors who prevent the occupier from surrounding Bakhmut, who destroy the enemy in the Vuhledar sector, leaving nothing but scorched marks on the ground, and who hold our other crucial frontline positions. Following these days, I would like to praise the warriors of the 66th separate mechanized brigade, 95th separate air assault brigade and 81st airmobile brigade who are extremely steadfast in defending the Luhansk region. And also the warriors of the 5th separate assault regiment who are heroically defending the Donetsk region. Thank you all, guys! Let's remember: every new result achieved for Ukraine means a shorter time to victory. In the evening, I signed decrees awarding our warriors. 186 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state decorations. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is the day of another Ramstein, a meeting of the group of military support for Ukraine. 54 partner countries. This is the ninth such meeting. We have got regular strong decisions on protecting our country and strengthening our warriors. Our partners have confirmed more air defense systems, more tanks, more artillery and shells, and more training for our military. As we heard today, Ukraine must be successful. And here we agree: there must be success. Of course, not everything about Ramstein can be reported in public. Much of the agreements and discussions should be kept behind closed doors of the Contact Group. But I can say for sure that the basic trends remain unchanged. Ukraine and its partners are doing everything together to make the terrorist state lose. And to make it happen as soon as possible. We can see now that the Kremlin is trying to squeeze all possible aggression potential out of Russia. They are in a hurry. Because they know that the world is still stronger, but it takes time to accumulate its strength. Therefore, speed is very important. Speed in everything. In decision-making. In the implementation of decisions. In delivery. In training. Speed saves lives, speed brings back safety. And I thank all our partners who realize that speed is important. I thank all of our American friends for their leadership and systematic coordination of the Ramstein meetings, as well as for the personal participation of Mr. Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense of the United States, and Mr. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in the meetings. Today I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada, who was on a visit to Ukraine. The topic of our conversation was also, so to speak, \"Ramstein-based\". First of all, defense support, new weapons for Ukraine, and new sanctions against Russia. I thanked Canada for the support it has already provided. And we discussed in detail with the Minister what is needed now to continue to oust the occupier from the Ukrainian land. We are actively preparing for the foreign policy events of the second half of this week. We have to go through the week in the tone set by Ramstein for it. Accumulating results for Ukraine. Today we have very good news from a group of our rescuers working in Türkiye. On the ninth day after the devastating earthquake, they managed to rescue a woman. Our SES rescuers pulled her out of the rubble and handed her over to doctors. It is very important not to lose hope under any circumstances and continue to fight for life. I am thankful to our entire rescue team! And, of course, today, just as every day, I stay in touch with our military, with the commanders. I had several meetings. The situation on the frontline, especially in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, remains extremely difficult. It is literally a battle for every meter of Ukrainian land. We must understand the significance of these battles. Every meter won there is a defense of our entire country. Every day that our heroes endure in Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Maryinka and other cities and communities in Donbas means the reduction of Russian aggression for weeks. That is where the unprecedented destruction of Russian potential is taking place now. Everything that the enemy loses in our Donbas, it will not be able to restore. And this is exactly the potential of Russian aggression that the leadership of the terrorist state expected to destroy our entire Ukraine. Glory to everyone who is now fighting for Ukraine! We are doing everything to give our warriors more weapons, longer-range weapons and greater might for the offensive we are preparing. And... today is Valentine's Day. I sincerely congratulate everyone who is in love on this holiday, on this day. And I congratulate all those in love with Ukraine! Together we will win! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we had a day that can be called preparatory. Preparatory for international events that will take place tomorrow and the day after. These days. As always, Ukraine's position must be heard. Hence, we are preparing our position so that it is guaranteed to be heard. This day was also preparatory for a longer-term perspective. Defense issues, economic issues - both with an eye to the spring of this year. We have to ensure that this spring it is truly felt that Ukraine is moving towards victory. This applies to the training of our defense forces, the supply of weapons for our country and our strategic initiative in the war. Any attempts by Russia to retake the initiative must be thwarted. And I am confident that we will do so. The enemy is already losing so many of its people, so many of its forces, that it will soon be difficult to find, for example, a \"marine\" throughout Russia. And our task is to make sure that there is less and less desire there to keep Ukrainian territories under occupation. The liberation of our land is the goal we are working on every day. Today I held an economic meeting, also to prepare for spring. We discussed many issues. All of them relate to the economic recovery of Ukraine, creating economic opportunities for our people and industries. The agricultural sector – there is a very acute issue of humanitarian land demining. An interagency working group has been set up at the Cabinet of Ministers level to ensure that this activity is intensified – the clearing of soil from mines and unexploded ordnance. The government is preparing new significant steps to deregulate the Ukrainian economy. Business will benefit from simplification in dozens of areas, including the abolition of various bureaucratic permits and licenses. Steps are also being prepared to create jobs. Every job in our country now is a contribution to our resilience. And it is a way to bring our people back to Ukraine. The relevant details will be presented at the government level. Of course, we also had a very meaningful conversation today about European integration. We are doing everything to prepare the start of negotiations on EU membership. In particular, this was discussed during the visit of the Prime Minister of Sweden. It is Sweden that currently holds the EU Presidency, and we have both the necessary leadership and the necessary will to start membership negotiations this year. Ukraine feels the support of its partners in this, and I am grateful for it. Today we also spoke in great detail with Mr. Prime Minister of Sweden about further defense assistance, about weapons for us, for Ukraine. Our defenders are very much looking forward to the Swedish Archers, one of the most powerful artillery systems. And Archers will definitely help our warriors. Today I spoke with the President of Azerbaijan. I thanked him for the sincere desire for peace for Ukraine, for the humanitarian support for our country and for his wise view on the protection of international law. We agreed to cooperate in global institutions. And, as it has become a tradition every evening... I want to thank our warriors. To each and every one of them, who with their resilience and bravery on the frontline enable us to prepare our next defense steps. The 54th separate mechanized brigade named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa, the 10th separate assault brigade \"Edelweiss\" - thank you guys for the effective defense of the Donetsk region! The 25th separate airborne Sicheslav brigade, the 81st separate airmobile brigade and the 95th air assault brigade - thank you guys for defending the Luhansk region! Every day of your defense now allows us to prepare the future liberation of our cities and communities. We cannot leave a single chance to all the occupiers. And we will not. I thank everyone who helps our country!  Glory to each and every one who is in combat! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you very much! Mr. Prime Minister, Jonas, thank you for your kind words about Ukraine and for your leadership. This is what strengthens both our countries. And of course, I am grateful for the globally important precedent of resilience that Norway is setting. Ladies and Gentlemen! Mr. President of the Storting, members of the Parliament and the Government! Mr. Prime Minister! People of Norway! I am grateful to all of you for your principled and unwavering support. For the thousands of Ukrainian lives saved. For the things that became a reality due to the Norwegian assistance to our defense. I first addressed the Norwegian Parliament and all Norwegians on the 35th day of this war. Today is the 358th day of the war. And the main difference between March last year and February this year is confidence. Confidence that the free world will not betray the values of freedom. Confidence that Ukraine will not be left alone with such an enemy. Confidence that Europe will not give up any of its rocks to the enemy, as every part of our Europe makes us all stronger. Norway's contribution to this confidence is truly historic. You help us with air defense systems, and this protects our cities from Russian terror. You help us with anti-tank weapons and artillery, and this saves Ukrainians from the expansion of Russian torture chambers and abuse on our land. You help us with the restoration of energy after missile strikes and Iranian drone strikes, and this returns people to normal life. And now you are setting a precedent of long-term financial support for a state that defends its independence and the right of every nation to live in accordance with generally recognized international norms. Why is this precedent important? Because it not only gives you the feeling that you have a tomorrow. It gives you the feeling that tomorrow, just like today, you will have a reliable partner by your side. A partner who values life and people as much as you do. A partner who, like you, understands the importance of social stability. A partner who, like you, wants states to border not with aggressors but with good neighbors. Ukrainians and Norwegians are exactly such partners. We share the same values, and therefore we are united in defense. United in defense, and therefore united in future victory. And it will be a solid basis for the security of everyone in the world if your view of resilience becomes a guideline for other defenders of freedom. Ladies and Gentlemen! The support program that Norway is approving for our country, which sets a precedent for guaranteed sustainable support for the struggle for freedom, is designed for five years. No one on earth today can say what exactly will happen during this time. Five years. But we all understand exactly what will not happen. Russia will not defeat our unity - all of us who value freedom. The Kremlin will not make intimidation and terror the new norm for Europe. A terrorist state will not convince anyone that killing and robbing is better than living by the law and cooperating. And the Russian flag will not take root in the occupied territory of Ukraine. This is just as sure as your NASAMS protect our skies. I especially thank you for them! Because every day and every night we need air defense - it is a matter of life for Ukraine. Just one example: last night there was another Russian missile attack, 36 missiles. Against people again, there were victims again. But still - half of the missiles were shot down! And we are doing our best to ensure that one hundred percent of Russian terror ends in failure. We've come a tremendous way since my first appeal to Storting. And we still have to work hard to win, this is obvious. We still have a lot to do on the battlefield in Ukraine. And we still have to remain vigilant in order not to lose the unity of the world and to constantly strengthen the resilience of our partners. But we are already confident that at the end of the road, no matter how long it may be, we will remain free, we will definitely gain peace and we will retain respect for ourselves and for each other. Because we do not betray our principles, and this is the most important thing. We are acting systemically and in a long-term manner, and this is the most effective manner. Thank you, Norway! Thank you again, Jonas, Mr. Prime Minister, and thank you to everyone here for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We have another piece of good news - we are bringing Ukrainians home from Russian captivity. Today we have brought back 101 people more. Most of them are Mariupol defenders, privates and sergeants. Navy, border guards, National Guard, ground troops, territorial defense. One civilian is the first deputy mayor of Enerhodar. I am happy for each of the more than a hundred Ukrainian families whose sons, brothers and husbands are returning. I am grateful to our Coordination Center, our entire team. Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Malyuk, Klymenko, Lubinets. And to everyone who is helping. Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff, and all the commanders of the operational directions took part in it. We heard detailed reports about the situation in each of the areas and the prospects for each of the operational directions. The supply of weapons, the supply of ammunition, training of our military. The enemy's plans and capabilities. The potential of the Ukrainian response. Keeping the situation on the frontline under control and preparing for any escalation steps of the enemy is a priority for the nearest future. Moving forward with the further liberation of our land is a priority that we are carefully preparing. I had several important international conversations today. Exactly those that strengthen us. Of the things I can talk about publicly, I will mention the following. In the morning, I took part in a meeting of the Norwegian Storting, the parliament. They were just working on a historic support package for our country - for five years. More than 7 billion dollars. Norway is one of our most consistent and energetic partners. This applies to weapons as well, in particular the powerful NASAMS air defense systems. And many other aspects of support. But what is especially important is that this package of long-term, five-year support is an example, a benchmark. This is the level that other partners see. I once again thank all Norwegians for the assistance packages already provided to our country and for today's decision. This is what really strengthens us. Today I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Israel, who was on a visit to Ukraine. We had a detailed conversation. I informed him about the situation on the frontline and our efforts on international platforms. In particular, I presented our Peace Formula and invited Israel to join its implementation. I met with the Leader of the British Labour Party and the Official Opposition. The British are a sincere and strong ally of ours, they are among the strongest defenders of global freedom. It is important that representatives of the entire political spectrum of the United Kingdom see with their own eyes what the Russian war has brought and how Ukrainians are determined to win and rebuild their country. It was a meaningful and useful meeting today. I once again thank Britain for all the support provided to our people, for all the defense power that we have gained with the help of the British. I spoke with the President of Kazakhstan. First and foremost, we talked about cooperation on international platforms - what we can do together for the sake of our common interests and the protection of international law. I thanked him for the humanitarian support for Ukraine. And a few other very important things. Today our Lithuanian brothers celebrate the 105th anniversary of the restoration of the Lithuanian state. This is a holiday whose importance is especially felt right now, when we, together with Lithuania, are defending our freedom and our right to Europe. I want to emphasize this again now: Lithuania started helping us even before Russia started its full-scale invasion. And I constantly feel this support - both from Mr. President Gitanas Nausėda and from the Lithuanian state as a whole. I am absolutely sure that we will celebrate the days of our statehood together many more times - and always in our free countries. I have just taken part in the opening of the 73rd Berlin Film Festival. As always, it is principled. As always, it is relevant. And this year, it is as much in solidarity with Ukraine and our struggle for freedom as possible. This year's blue and yellow colors of the Berlinale's symbol, the famous bear, are really touching. And powerful. Together we prove that even a bear can be the right one. I am grateful to all the filmmakers who did not remain indifferent and support us with the power of their works and their influence. I thank all the organizers and participants of the festival. And of course, I am thankful to Sean Penn, who was in Ukraine on the first day of the full-scale invasion and who has been only more determined to support Ukrainians since then. And praising our defenders, honoring our heroes. Paratroopers of the 79th separate air assault brigade and artillerymen of the 55th separate artillery brigade - thank you guys for your bravery and precision. Thank you for your skillful and steadfast defense of the Donetsk region. Zaporizhzhia direction - I thank all the warriors of the 129th separate Kryvyi Rih territorial defense brigade. They firmly hold the line of defense. And, of course, I thank our Air Forces, all the air defense fighters and pilots who ensured the result in shooting down the Russian missiles today. 36 missiles and drones during today's attack. Half of them were shot down. We do our best to ensure that our warriors are capable of shooting down the enemy's entire arsenal in our skies. I thank everyone who helps! Glory to each and every one who is now in combat! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear organizers, participants, friend of Ukraine Sean, and guests of the 73rd Berlin Film Festival! Ladies and Gentlemen! In preparing for this address, I remembered a phrase that you are all well familiar with. “Break the fourth wall.” An imaginary border between the one who is on the screen and a viewer. At the same time, cinema is able to overcome other walls and barriers existing in the world. Both real and ideological. It is enough to mention the story of the great German director Wim Wenders. In my opinion, in a certain sense of the word, he broke the Berlin Wall two years before its actual fall. In the outstanding film Der Himmel über Berlin, where the divided city is united by Angels flying freely over the wall. At that time, Wenders could not even imagine that one day, in basically the same place, he would open the 50th Berlinale. Where once there was a wall and emptiness – now life is booming and the heart of the Berlinale beats. And it seems very symbolic to me. For many years, Potsdam Square was \"cut through\" by the Berlin Wall. Formally, it divided West and East Berlin. It divided the free world and the totalitarian one. And it is not only about state borders on the map. The wall divided different worldviews, philosophies, different values. Today, Russia wants to build the same wall in Ukraine. A wall between us and Europe.  To separate Ukraine from its own choice and its own future. A wall between freedom and slavery. Between the right to life and missile attacks. Between progress  and the ruins that Russia leaves behind. A wall between civilization and tyranny. A logical question comes up: On which side should culture and art be? Are they still out of politics? Russia has been waging a full-scale war against us for almost a year. For almost a year it has been shelling and destroying peaceful cities, for almost a year it has been killing people, killing women and children, threatening the world with a nuclear attack, provoking food, energy, environmental, migration and other crises on all continents. Can art be outside of politics? Should cinema be out of politics? This is an eternal question, but today it is again extremely relevant. I think about it when I hear strange calls for representatives of Russian sports, read about strange invitations to perform for Russian musicians, discussions about scientists, cinema, and culture in general. I was thinking about this... last night when Russia launched yet another massive missile attack on Ukraine. 36 rockets and Iranian drones! Culture and cinema can be outside politics. But not when it is a policy of aggression. Not when it is a policy of mass crimes, murders, terror, the desire to destroy other countries and other peoples. When it is a policy of total war. That is, the politics of today's Russia. Under such circumstances and at such times, art cannot be neutral. Cannot be \"out\". Culture makes choices in times like these. Culture chooses the side. Or speaks out in different ways fighting and standing against evil. Or – ovelooks and remains silent – and, in fact, helping the evil. When art is indifferent and its voice is not heard, in this silence the loud speakers of evil sound stronger and more convincingly. Of course, in a global sense, cinema cannot change the world. But it can influence and inspire people who can change the world. A good movie evokes emotions. Cult cinema causes change. In humanity's struggle against any evil, there are always two voices – truth and propaganda. For a while, propaganda can muzzle the truth. But it is not able to win completely. If art does not stop the struggle and understands that standing aside means being close to evil. The Berlinale made its choice. And confirmed the truth of my statement. Professing the principles of openness, equality, dialogue without borders and the cinema from all over the world, the Berlinale made a choice. Institutions and persons supporting the Kremlin and films made with Russia’s support are not admitted to this year's festival. We appreciate it and are grateful for it. This is really important. This is not a formality. This is justice. We are grateful for Ukraine's support, attention to Ukraine, solidarity with Ukraine. Proof of this is the official badge for participants and guests of the Berlinale – the Golden Bear, which this year has become blue and yellow. These are the colors of Ukraine. The colors of our flag. We will do everything to return him to his rightful place and free all our lands. Your support in this is important and invaluable to us. Now there are thousands of kilometers between us. But we are side by side. We speak different languages, but there is complete understanding between us. Only a virtual border separates us. But there is no wall between us. Ladies and Gentlemen!  In 1951, the first Berlin Film Festival took place. You all know the slogan and purpose of the first Berlinale. This is the Showcase of the free world. Today, Ukraine is the Fortress of the free world. A fortress that has stood for almost a year. A fortress that protects itself, Europe and the world. A fortress that cannot fall. A fortress that will definitely stand. And will win. I believe that you will all be convinced of this, after seeing our \"Superpower\" – the superpower of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Ladies and Gentlemen! I greet all of you and would like to remedy one injustice right away. This panel discussion is called ‘David on the Dnipro’. I consider it as a rightful respect to Ukraine and to everything our people are doing. But this year determination was shown on different banks – and not only of the Dnipro. Spree and Seine, Thames and Potomac, Vistula and Tiber – David is now all of us, he is a whole free world. David is everyone who felt that there is no alternative but to defeat Goliath, who came to destroy our life. Being David is fighting. And we are fighting. Being David is having a sling to win. We do not have yet the David's Sling from Israel. But I believe it is just temporarily. Now I would like to thank for the powerful support and mighty weapons. I thank Olaf and Emmanuel who are present here on this panel. I thank all our partners present here in Munich – the United States, Britain, all the countries of the EU and all from the world. I am grateful to everyone who gives the sling to Ukrainian David, thanks to which Russian Goliath has already started to lose his ground. We saw it last year. And he will definitely fall. Already this year! We can make it. All of us together – just as David did. We can make sure that there is no alternative to our victory. But then – there should be no alternative to our determination. To the determination of all of us – on Dnipro and on Spree, on Seine and on Thames, on Potomac and on Vistula, on Tiber, on Danube and on Jordan – and in every part of the world where freedom is valued more than the mercy of a tyrant. Last year, when I was here in Munich at the Conference, I was looking for such common determination. Ukraine was clearly telling the world: we will fight for ourselves if Russia starts a full-scale war. I wanted to hear from the world: Ukraine, we will be with you. Unfortunately, I heard it only after Russian missiles struck our land. Already after the Russian tanks started moving. Already after Putin destroyed all alternatives, leaving just one – who will win? He or us? In fact, you have already responded with the name of this Conference’s panel discussion. Goliath has no chances. But, unfortunately, he has potential. Unfortunately, he tries to buy additional time for his aggression, trading with the world. Unfortunately, he can still destroy many lives. That is why we need to hurry up. We need speed. Speed of our agreements. Speed of delivery to strengthen our sling. Speed of decisions to limit Russian potential. There is no alternative to speed. Because it is the speed that life depends on.  Delay has always been and still is a mistake. While we negotiate how to strengthen our defense with modern tanks, the Kremlin is thinking about ways to strangle Moldova. While we are trying to convince that Ukraine needs modern combat aircraft, the Kremlin has already convinced the Iranian regime. The result is not only lethal Iranian drones in Ukrainian skies. But also something, with which the Kremlin paid for it. Are you sure it's just money? Or, maybe, the world will face the \"enriched Iranian regime\"? And to what extent – 90%, 92% or 100%? I am sure none of us wants to let the region of Middle East and the Gulf taste it. While we spend weeks to agree on new sanctions against Russia, the terrorist state is looking for ways to adapt to the restrictions already in place – through parallel imports, shadow fleet of tankers and the like. Where shall we see the impact of this illegal profit of Russia? In the efforts to corrupt your political systems and international institutions. In attempts to destabilize your social life and in disinformation campaigns against your people. In escalations in those regions that are sensitive to you. What awaits, for example, Libya, Mali or the Central African Republic, while Moscow has the power? What awaits Syria? Nothing good. Just like many other nations. So, you will have no rest as well. So, it's not just about Ukraine. The point is that Goliath must lose. There is no alternative to this! Because the Kremlin can break the security and peace of all, who are now represented here in Munich. Delayed decisions of the world are a resource Putin's dictatorship lives on. It's been that way for years. The longer the talks about the enlargement of the European Union dragged on, the more destructiveness the Kremlin brought to the – then – gray zone between the European Union and Russia. The louder it was said that it was necessary to wait before Ukraine was allowed to enter NATO's \"open\" door, the more aggressive Russian policy became. The longer the silence on Crimea on the global agenda lasted, the more vigorous Russian revanchism became. The more the world argued over what sanctions and when to impose against Russia, the more shameless the Kremlin's ambitions became. The longer we in Ukraine, in Europe and in the world had no unity, the more illusions Russia had. Now all this is being corrected. Just like last year, I now propose to act immediately. But unlike last year, now I have the most convincing argument – our achievements. Can we deter Russian strikes? Yes. Can we protect our cities from Russian missiles? Definitely. Can we liberate our land? There are one thousand eight hundred and ninety-one proofs of this. That is exactly how many cities, towns and villages we managed to liberate from the Russian occupation. Can we restore security in the Black Sea region, and food security in the world? The Black Sea Grain Initiative and the humanitarian initiative “Grain from Ukraine” are convincing. Is it time for Ukraine to be a full-fledged part of the European Union? Most Europeans support membership for Ukraine. We have already gained the status of a candidate country. We are already preparing to start membership negotiations. We are already united with the European economy, logistics and energy. There is no alternative to Ukrainian victory. There is no alternative to Ukraine in the EU. There is no alternative to Ukraine in NATO. There is no alternative to our unity. Hence, there is no and should not be any alternative to completely get rid of Russian aggression. To liberate the land, to liberate people. Because every city, town and village that remains under occupation means people staying in captivity. May people be the subject of compromise? No. We have to liberate Ukraine – and Europe. Because when the Russian weapon shoots at us, it is already pointed at our neighbors. May Europe be the subject of compromise? No. We have to liberate from Russia's aggressive potential every international institution and every sphere of the world economy. Because only then there will be a chance for freedom to pass-through our border – further to the East. May freedom be the subject of compromise? No. And it’s a rock-solid No. I am confident that we can gain victory not only over Putin, but also over putins; not only over putins in Russia but all around the world. Wouldn't this be proof of the power of the idea of freedom? It will definitely be. Ladies and Gentlemen! Determination is never abstract. David defeated Goliath not by the power of conversation, but by the power of his actions. By courage and sling. Courage is what we have. There is enough of it. Not only in Ukraine, but in our entire coalition of victory. The sling should get stronger. Right now. So that the next year we would gather here in Munich for the first security Post-War Conference. Under the condition of free Ukraine. Free Europe. And the free world. Olaf, Emmanuel, all our friends – I think you've got me right. I thank you for your attention! You – Davids of the free world! We, united Davids shall prevail over putins scattered all over the world! Glory to everyone who is now on the battlefield! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Prime Minister Davis, dear colleagues! Each and everyone in the Caribbean Community who loves peace and enjoys living in line with the law! I am honored to address your community of states for the first time. It is a special mission – to thank you for your support of Ukraine and the international order. An order that is vital for everyone in the world – both for the largest and the smallest ones. Because all in the world are equal and deserve to live with dignity and independence. Ladies and Gentlemen! The modern world is always on the edge – between the force and the law. The force – like in the old days of inhuman invaders. And the law – to maintain freedom and security for everyone. Whatever part of the world you take, anywhere it is noticeable. This confrontation, this brink that defines destinies of nations. Ukraine values the power of law. Just like you. And we defend ourselves from those who believe in nothing else but brutal force. This is the meaning of the war that’s happening now, now and here – in Europe. But the war here is affecting not only our region. All-in-all, this is a war in which the world will cross that line between the force and the law. Ukraine is fighting to make the law prevail. The UN Charter – to prevail. The international conventions and treaties – to be effective. So that everyone in the world has guarantees – guarantees that no crime of aggression will be committed against him. Ladies and Gentlemen! As of this day, about eighteen percent of Ukraine's territory is occupied by Russia. One hundred and nine thousand forty-five square kilometers. Is normal life possible there, on that part of our land? No, it is not. Human life is worthless there. This is what Russia has brought to our land with its occupation. Russia's domination means no human rights but the rule of militarized gangs. When Russia comes, it means that repressions and murder come. If the Russian flag appears, it means that torture chambers and total looting will appear. And when we finally manage to liberate the land from Russian forces, we see a humanitarian disaster area where everything has to be rebuilt. One hundred and nine thousand forty-five square kilometers of human rights violations, looting, humiliation, and death. Death. This is the reason why we are fighting so hard to drive Russia out of our land. This is the reason why we are trying so hard to restore the power of international law. This is the reason why it was Ukraine, who proposed the Peace Formula, that can end this war and restore everything destroyed by the Russian aggression. Our Formula covers all aspects of damages: from damage to international law – to environmental harm. Russia is not just burning down cities, killing people and stealing property. Russia is destroying the environment. Russia is shelling chemical plants. Its aggression brings about destruction and flooding of coal mines. Mines and hostilities in the Black Sea resulted in death of tens of thousands of living creatures. All these damages are to be fixed by our Peace Formula. And I know that Russian propaganda – and in your region in particular – draws a completely different picture of what is happening on our land and in Europe. But I warn you that if Russia, God forbid, is successful in any way, the balance in the world will change. Not in favor of law. But in favor of violence. The aggressor must always lose. The law must always prevail. The truth must always spread throughout the world. And every state in the world – big or small – should have the right to its independence and to the respect of all others for this independence. These are the principles of Ukraine. These – I know, are your principles. I thank you for being on the side of the law. I thank you for your efforts to bring stability to your region and the world. But real stability is possible only when we all together protect the world from state thuggery. So I encourage you to further cooperation! Next week we will present at the UN General Assembly a resolution on a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace in Ukraine, and hence the restoration of the full force of the international rules-based order. Your votes matter! I have presented the Peace Formula and your leadership can help to implement it. And of course, I invite you all to visit Ukraine. Peace is a value that must be cared-for together! Thank you for your attention! And I wish you a lasting peace! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! A brief report on this day. Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, visited Kyiv. A leader who greatly helps us protect freedom. The leader of the state helping us a lot to protect Ukraine and all of Europe. The Netherlands is among Ukraine's leading partners. It is manifested in defense, political, and legal support. Today, we had, as always, meaningful negotiations with Mark. There will be more weapons for our soldiers, more pressure on the terrorist state, and more opportunities to restore justice. Together with the Netherlands, we are working to punish Russia for this aggression and to compensate for the damage caused by the war. There is already a concrete solution – to place a register of damage in The Hague. It is the first important element of the future compensation mechanism. I am sure we will reach other necessary solutions. Russia will be held fully responsible for everything it has done against Ukraine and the Ukrainians. Today, I had the honor to present our people, our defenders at the opening of the Munich Security Conference. It is one of the most important international gatherings, and this year's conference represents the significant powers of the modern world. Thanks to all of you, Ukrainian men and women, who defend our state, there is no Russia in Munich. The key message of Ukraine at the security conference is obvious: we must do everything to ensure the collapse of Russian aggression already this year. It is possible. It is necessary. But it is possible if Ukraine gets the weapons necessary for this. Therefore, our diplomatic marathon continues without a break – since my visit to Washington in December. A tank coalition has already been created for Ukraine, the taboo on the supply of long-range missiles has already been lifted, there have already been new successes in strengthening our artillery, and the world has already heard how necessary the creation of an aviation coalition for Ukraine is for global security. I talked about it today with Prime Minister Rutte, and during the week – with other leaders. I will continue these negotiations next week. I will continue consolidating support for our country's initiatives in the UN General Assembly. Next week we will introduce an important resolution, and today I presented its essence, particularly to the heads of government of the Caribbean Commonwealth. Ukraine always bases its foreign policy on respect for all participants in international relations. All nations are equal and deserve an independent life, and peaceful cooperation with other nations. This principle of ours meets understanding in all parts of the world. And I thank every state, and every nation that supports Ukrainian efforts to stabilize international relations. And the most important thing. Of course, today, like any other day, I am in constant contact with the commanders. I held a meeting with representatives of the defense sector. We are doing everything to strengthen our soldiers on the front line – our heroes who inspire the world by how they bravely and steadfastly defend the freedom of Ukraine, our land, our values. Again and again, I mention our fighters who defend Donetsk and Luhansk regions. 54th Separate Mechanized Brigade, 95th Separate Assault Brigade, 25th Separate Airborne Brigade – I thank you, soldiers! I thank you all who hold our positions at the front, who destroy the enemy, and who give us all faith in victory. The victory of Ukraine! Glory to each and every one who is now in battle! Thank you to everyone who helps our country! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! This day began with preventive power outages in some regions of our state. These outages were required to protect networks and generation facilities from another Russian missile attack. And we end this Saturday without power outages in almost the entire territory of our state. Apart from Odesa, where the recovery continues after previous attacks and some areas where networks were damaged by wind gusts. Most of the territory of Ukraine has power. Most of our people have electricity. And it is another confirmation of our resilience, the strength of Ukraine, and the colossal work that was and is being done by many people. By everyone who restores and protects energy. By all who work to strengthen our air defense. By all our partners who help. And, of course, by all our soldiers who defend Ukraine every day, every night as part of the Air Force and all our defense and security forces. I thank everyone who contributed to the defense of the Ukrainian sky and the state's power system! It is a very important result for Ukraine. The result we achieved together. We will continue doing everything possible and impossible to give Ukraine more air defense, more guarantees of stability, and more protection against any Russian strikes. Today in Germany, in Munich, the security conference continued. It is the second day of the conference. Not just the Ukrainian topic, but the topic of Ukrainian victory, which we are approaching, obviously dominated the discussions at the conference today. There are important statements by world leaders in support of our state, and there are signals about strengthening weapons for our defense. It applies, in particular, to long-range missiles, other weapons, and the long-term support of Ukraine. I am grateful to all the leaders for their support and for what happened yesterday. And for the signals that were in Munich today, which confirm that Russian aggression will have only one final, namely the defeat of the terrorist state. And we must do everything to hasten the Russian defeat. The pressure of the world should be such that Russia does not have time to find new forms of terror. By the way, our diplomatic work next week will be devoted to exactly this – the acceleration of our movement. We expect important news for Ukraine, and for our security. Traditionally, I want to thank all those, who are currently defending the state on the battlefield. I especially want to note everyone, who defends Donetsk region. The most brutal and principled fighting is going on there. Confrontation, which a lot of what we are preparing for the near future depends on. I thank the paratroopers of the 79th Separate Assault Brigade, the Marines of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade, the infantrymen of the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, the soldiers of the 55th Separate and 27th Rocket Artillery Brigades. Thanks to all of you, warriors! Today, there is something to celebrate with the fighters who fight near Zaporizhzhia. The 128th Separate Brigade of the territorial defense forces – thank you, guys, for repelling the attacks! I would also like to thank all our signalmen today for their excellent service! To everyone who efficiently and timely provides logistics for our troops, and to all the Support Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Thank you! Thank you to everyone for whom the stability of Ukraine and our positions are an unconditional personal, official, and professional priority! And one more. This week, we received strong signals from our partners, and concrete agreements regarding the inevitability of holding Russia accountable for aggression, for terror against Ukraine and its people. Every Russian attack on the city of Kharkiv and the region, Sumy region and Donetsk region, Khmelnytsky, our Nikopol, and every corner of our state will have concrete legal consequences for the terrorist state. It applies not only to the evil that Russia has brought since February 24 but also since 2014. We remember everything. We remember Ilovaisk, we remember the Donetsk airport. We remember the battles for Debaltseve – especially today – and every attack on our people. We have to restore justice. We will do it. Let's do it together with the whole world. Glory to each and every one who is in battle today! Eternal memory to all those, whose lives were taken by this war, this state – Russia – and its aggression! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! It’s Sunday today, yet it is a very meaningful and, as always, a working day for the state. I held a meeting of the Staff in a new format, an expanded one. Both the Commander-in-Chief and the commanders of directions reported, there were also reports directly from the frontline. We are leveling the situation, doing everything to prepare our actions planned for the future, for the nearest future. And also what is being done now, these days, on the frontline. The Commander-in-Chief reported on the overall situation at the front, with a special emphasis on mobilization, the specific situation, on how and what is being done. I heard detailed reports at the Staff’s meeting on each combat position, each hottest area. General Syrskyi reported on the Bakhmut direction, Khortytsia operational and strategic group of troops. How we are defending our positions, how we are strengthening this particular direction and how much enemy forces we are eliminating. General Sodol reported on the Vuhledar direction, Donetsk operational and tactical group. The situation is very difficult. We are fighting. We are breaking the invader and inflicting extremely tangible losses on Russia. I repeat again and again: the more Russia loses there, in Donbas – Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Maryinka, Kreminna, the sooner we can end this war with Ukraine's victory. I heard a report on the situation in the south. In particular, General Hnatov reported on the Odesa direction. The situation is unchanged, we are controlling all potential prospects. General Tarnavsky reported on the specific results of the defense of Tavria operational and strategic group of troops. Thanks to all our warriors who are defending Zaporizhzhia and this entire area! The northern direction, Kyiv, is a must. There was a report by General Nayev. The General reported that the situation is completely under control. As well as along the entire northern border. The Minister of the Interior reported on forming new Offensive Guard brigades. There are great results. It is a very useful experience showing how people can and should be motivated. I will continue this format of work both at the Staff and in informing on defense management. I want our people to know and understand what we prepare and control, and how we do that. Of course, military issues, details of intelligence actions cannot be told in full. But I want our people to have predictability right now. And a feeling that Ukraine is moving towards its goals. Budanov, Malyuk and Lytvynenko delivered reports on that. Today we have a new sanctions step by our state against all those who fuel Russian aggression. I have signed a decree enacting the NSDC decision on sanctions against Russian financial entities. These are Ukraine's sanctions. But each of our sanctions packages becomes the basis for working on sanctions with our partners. The next EU sanctions package - the tenth one already - is now being prepared. We are working with our partners to strengthen it. But we are also working with other actors in global relations. Sanctions for terror are something where the efforts of every responsible state can push the global process forward. And it will be so. Today I spoke with President of France Macron. We talked about further defense support, about protecting our people and the whole of Europe. I thank Mr. President for his understanding of our needs and for our shared feeling that we cannot waste a single opportunity and a single week in defending ourselves against Russian aggression. We discussed our joint diplomatic efforts with France, our cooperation on international platforms. We also discussed important decisions that we are preparing for this week - for the year of our invincibility. Today I also held several meetings with government officials and with our international bloc - of the Office and the government. With representatives of the defense sector. There will be new initiatives, new results for Ukraine, new achievements in relations with partners. I thank everyone who defends Ukraine! I am grateful to each and every one who is now in combat! I thank everyone who helps our country! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "My dear people! Ukrainians know what it means to fight for their freedom and defend it. In the squares. On the barricades. On the frontline. In difficult and pivotal moments of history, we never give up and always show bravery and selflessness. Ukrainians stand up for their brothers, and everyone who is Ukrainian is a brother. This is the basis of our unity. The unity that gives our country and people a future despite everything. The unity that gives us indomitability. And this is the basis of our connection with the world, with all those who value freedom and are ready to defend it. The time comes when the voices of millions merge into a single voice of the people, saying that Ukrainians want and will live only in a free state. In their own Ukraine. Which will certainly survive. And which will certainly preserve freedom. Today we honor the heroes who gave their lives for Ukraine and Ukrainians during the Revolution of Dignity. The Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred. People of different ages and professions, from different regions, but with the same and true values. This is respect for every person. Freedom and equality. Democracy. Ukraine's openness to the world and the unity of our country with the whole of Europe. And, of course, it is Ukraine's independence. What motivated the Maidans to gather and defend themselves. What motivates us to fight and liberate our land now. Dear people! As we defend Ukraine today, we remember that our strength and fortitude are based on the strength and fortitude of many Ukrainians who did not give up, who dreamed and acted for Ukraine to live. Nine years after the Revolution of Dignity, the battle for our independence continues. For an independent, free and powerful Ukraine, European and democratic, independent and united. And there is no doubt that we will protect all this, that we will make the dream of Ukrainian heroes come true. Slaves are not allowed to paradise. This is the essence of the Ukrainian interpretation of freedom. This is the reason why there will be no enemy left on our land. Glory to each and every one who is now fighting for our country! May the memory of all those who gave their lives for Ukraine and Ukrainians live forever! Eternal honor to the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a symbolic day. The 362nd day of a full-scale war, and we, in our free capital of our free country, are hosting a visit from our powerful ally, the President of the United States of America, and talking to him about the future of Ukraine, our relations, the whole of Europe and global democracy. This is an indicator of how resilient Ukraine is. And how important Ukraine is to the world. The ninth anniversary of the most horrific days of Maidan, the anniversary of the beginning of Russian aggression against our country, when there was very little time left before the occupation of our Crimea. And now, nine years later, we are more confident than ever that justice will be served. The aggressor state, which has consistently been moving towards becoming a terrorist state, will be held accountable for its crimes. It will be held accountable thanks to the efforts of Ukraine and all our partners, the entire free world, and all those who are now helping us to defend our independence, freedom, and international law and order. We will prevail in this historic confrontation. When President Biden - then Vice President - addressed the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in December 2015, he emphasized a very important point: it is no exaggeration to say that the hopes of all freedom-loving people around the world are with us, with Ukrainians, because so much depends on the success of our fragile experiment with democracy. For our country, for the whole of Europe - free and peaceful. For the whole world, where democracy is under threat. We are now absolutely certain that there is nothing that can undermine our democracy. No element of Ukrainian life is fragile anymore and will never be fragile. And our resilience is a powerful contribution to the resilience of all freedom-loving nations in the world. It is now and in Ukraine that the fate of the world order, which is based on rules, on humanity, on predictability, is being decided. And today, President Biden and I talked, in particular, about how to do everything to ensure our common victory this year in the war that Russia unleashed. Unleashed nine years ago. The full-scale war has been ongoing since last February. We have to do everything to put an end to Russian aggression this year, to liberate our still occupied territories and to guarantee reliable security for our country and for all the peoples of Europe who want to live in freedom and peace. The specific steps for this are known. Our defense needs for this are known. The active actions required for this - the actions of our warriors at the front first of all - are also well known to our partners. All we need is determination. Today I saw such determination of President Biden and the United States of America. And I want to thank Mr. President for this visit and for the talks - really useful talks - that actually continued our conversation that we started in Washington during my visit in December. We are working on the supply of long-range weapons and other types of weapons that were not previously included in the support packages. And I am grateful for another package that will definitely strengthen our guys on the frontline. I am also thankful, on behalf of all Ukrainians, to all Americans - ordinary people and community leaders, members of Congress from both parties, and all members of President Biden's team - for bringing our relationship - between Ukraine and America - to a historically most meaningful level. We can be called true allies, and our alliance with America truly strengthens the world. This week we will continue our diplomatic work with representatives of the United States. There will also be significant developments in relations with our other partners both in Europe and around the world. A year of full-scale war, a year of our invincibility, which was a response to the Kremlin's illusion of \"three days for Kyiv\"... A year! And we are organizing a truly Ukrainian global week. Today I held talks with the IMF Managing Director who arrived in Kyiv. I was very pleased to hear a positive assessment of the resilience of our institutions, the efficiency and effectiveness of our country in the face of such brutal and total aggression. There are situations when states fail even in much easier conditions. The Ukrainian state has passed terrible challenges and retained its full functionality. This is another achievement of our people - all those who work for the state. An achievement that is worth commending right now - on these days, on the eve of the anniversary of the invasion. Ukrainians are capable of very significant things, and every day we see new evidence of this. Today I would like to praise our heroes on the frontline traditionally. Those who demonstrate extraordinary courage, incredible resilience and the efficiency Ukraine needs in destroying the enemy every day. Paratroopers of the 79th separate air assault brigade. Infantrymen of the 72nd and the 110th separate mechanized brigades. Units and maintenance forces of these brigades. Gunners of the 55th separate artillery brigade. Thank you, guys, for your bravery and precision in the Donetsk region! Also, the 128th separate mountain assault brigade and the 1st artillery division of the 44th separate artillery brigade. Thank you guys for the worthy response to the enemy's attacks against our Zaporizhzhia! The 66th and the 92nd separate mechanized brigades, the 81st separate airmobile brigade, and the 95th separate air assault brigade. Thank you, guys, for not only inflicting significant losses on the enemy in the Luhansk region, but also for giving faith in our movement to liberate our land. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps! May the memory of everyone who gave life for the freedom of Ukraine live forever! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I started this day with an extended and detailed meeting of the Staff. Including reports from the frontline from our commanders in the hottest directions. Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny reported on the overall frontline situation and enemy missile attacks on our positions. Of course, the reports on the Donetsk and Luhansk regions evoke particular emotions. We are doing our best to deter enemy attacks there - constant intense assaults, which Russia does not stop, even though it suffers huge losses there. General Syrskyi reported on the Bakhmut and Lyman directions. Fierce battles are taking place. Principled battles. We are doing everything to support our guys. General Tarnavskyi reported on the fighting in the Avdiivka and other directions. The invaders are using the entire range of weapons against our guys there, including CS gas grenades. But very importantly, despite all the pressure on our forces, the frontline has not changed. I am grateful for this to all our warriors, all soldiers and sergeants, officers and generals who are defending the respective frontline areas. Other commanders of our Defense and Security Forces also reported to the Staff. Nayev, North, and Odesa operational and strategic group of troops, Moskalyov – I heard their reports, the situation has not changed significantly. Intelligence - Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate Budanov - on the real essence of Russia's trifle with rhetoric about strategic weapons. Foreign intelligence. The Security Service of Ukraine. Forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the National Guard, the Border Guard Service. The Minister of Defense. Other representatives of the government. We pay full attention to every detail of our Defense Plan and the enemy's ambitions. There was also a report by Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal on the situation in the energy sector and the process of restoring our energy system after the Russian strikes. I would like to note that we have good news, good results, and this is the achievement of all our power engineers, repairmen, central and local authorities who have been performing the relevant tasks. We meet the energy needs of people and businesses in most of Ukraine. We continue our diplomatic marathon to strengthen Ukrainian warriors and our entire country. Today I met with the Italian delegation headed by Prime Minister Mrs. Giorgia Meloni. Italy has been supporting us in our struggle for independence in a principled and powerful way. There is a new package of defense support, including air defense. Italy is ready to work with us to implement the Peace Formula. And this includes such an important point as justice. This means a tribunal for the aggressor and a compensation mechanism for Ukraine. Today we also discussed new sanctions against Russia. I am grateful to all Italians for their historic support of Ukraine on its way to the European Union. When we were applying for the candidacy, Italy's position gave a very important impetus to the position of the entire European Union. This year, I believe we will be able to make even more progress and do everything we can to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership. Today I also met with a delegation of the U.S. Congress. This is a very important signal for our country, the entire region and the world. Yesterday, President Biden was in Kyiv. Today - representatives of the Congress, namely members of the Republican Party. Our cooperation with America does not stop for a single day or a single minute. Together we are effectively strengthening global security. And, by the way, the bewildered complaints coming from Moscow are just another proof of our effectiveness - of Ukraine, the United States, and the entire free world. One more thing. The Russian army has once again brutally shelled Kherson today. There are wounded and dead. My condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones... This Russian shelling did not and could not have any military purpose. As well as thousands of similar Russian attacks, which are a real message from Russia to the world. The terrorist state is trying to tell the world by firing missiles at city streets, at residential buildings, at schools, at pharmacies and hospitals, at churches, at bus stops, at markets, at power plants that terror is allegedly something to be reckoned with... I am confident that we will put the terrorist state in its place. All together: Ukrainians and the world. Our army, our intelligence, our Security Service and other Ukrainian forces will find and destroy those who are carrying out these brutal attacks on Kherson, on our other cities and regions. And more broadly, we will prove that only humanity, only the UN Charter, and only the right of every nation to live freely and securely from terror and insane aggressions like Russia's are to be reckoned with. I thank everyone who defends our country! I thank everyone who is fighting for Ukraine on the frontline right now, who protects our borders, who protects our skies and our sea, who produces and supplies equipment and ammunition for our soldiers, and who provides us with high-quality intelligence information! Glory to our warriors! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russia and this war! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Glory to Ukraine! Dear officers, generals! Dear graduates and lecturers of Lviv and Odesa Military Academies! Everyone who dedicated life to the defense of our state and independence! Congratulations on the opportunity to make the historic Ukrainian victory part of your destiny! A victory that our people have been dreaming of for many generations. A victory that the Ukrainian people and our statehood have lacked for so long. It is now and in this war, which Ukrainians did not start, but which we have to end with our joint victory, that Ukraine will gain guaranteed protection. Protection for generations. There will be no enemy on our land. There will be no shackles on our people. There will be no humiliation on Ukrainians. There will not even be a thought somewhere in a foreign land that it is allegedly possible to attack Ukraine and get something for yourself. This is the result you have to achieve in battles. You have to achieve it together with your soldiers, together with your brothers and sisters in arms, together with our entire country. Ukrainians are proud of their army, of our entire Defense Forces, and this is an honest pride. Thousands of Ukrainian warriors have earned it with their bravery, resilience, and precision. I am confident that you can become just such warriors. I would also like to address the parents and educators of our young officers. For the second time in the course of the full-scale war, our military educational institutions are sending worthy new officers to the officer corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations. Choosing this life path is a sign of a person's strength, and thus the strength of the family, the strength of the characters of those close to this person. I thank you, dear mothers and fathers of our young officers, dear educators, for the kind of upbringing that allows them to become a strong pillar for the army, the state and the people at such a crucial time. Dear officers! Soon, you will join the active army, our Defense Forces. You will join the teams of combat brigades - mechanized, motorized infantry, tank, artillery, air assault, mountain assault, assault and marine infantry, as well as special forces units. Some of you will lead units in the new offensive brigades that are being formed. Always and everywhere - be brave and take care of your soldiers. Always and everywhere - take care of the honor of your units, believe in yourself and believe in Ukraine! Be worthy of the heroism of all those who have already shown themselves in the battles for Ukraine and Ukrainians! Be worthy of our victory. The victory will happen! Glory to the graduates of the military academies of Ukraine! Glory to our Armed Forces! Glory to all the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report on this day. I had the honor to address the graduates of our military academies in Lviv and Odesa. The young officers who will soon go to the active army. To the combat brigades fighting for our country and to the new brigades that are being formed. It is a special mission to receive military education right now and to know that tomorrow this education will be needed directly on the battlefield to protect the state and to lead soldiers and units. I am happy that Ukraine's higher military educational institutions have no shortage of those who really want to be a Ukrainian officer, who want to be an educated and effective Ukrainian officer, who want to make the story of the Ukrainian victory in this war their own life story. I wished our young officers to be worthy of the heroism that our warriors are already demonstrating on the battlefield and that Ukrainians have always demonstrated in their struggle for freedom. I wished victory to the graduates of our military universities and I am confident that this victory will come. Today, we continued our diplomatic marathon to strengthen Ukraine and protect international law, which gives our country more security. I spoke with four leaders of states. In a conversation with the President of Pakistan, we emphasized the absolute importance of maintaining full force and respect for the UN Charter, the independence of nations and the territorial integrity of states. We discussed our efforts to ensure food security and the existing threats to such security. By the way, our grain export initiative has been operating for seven months already. Over this time, 43 countries have already received more than 22 million tons of food through our sea exports. This is a significant Ukrainian contribution to global food security and stabilization of the global food market. If it was not for this initiative of ours, unfortunately, there would be political and social chaos in some countries in Africa and Asia, and the cost of living crisis that various nations experienced last year would be much more acute. But if this initiative of ours had worked at full capacity, if Russia had not tried to slow it down, we would have been able to export more food products. That is, there would be significantly more guarantees of food security in the world. Our partners know exactly what Russia's deliberate actions are undermining food security. Still we are working to provide the necessary stability. We must understand that this is not only a contribution to global security. Our seaborne food exports benefit Ukraine. About a million Ukrainians work in industries related to agricultural production. And for them, the fact that we unblocked maritime exports last year is a guarantee of personal and family social security. Today I spoke with the President of Estonia. I thanked him for the unwavering support for Ukraine at all levels. This includes support with weapons and sanctions against Russia, as well as political support, in particular in European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Today we discussed the upcoming NATO Summit in Vilnius and our expectations in the context of Ukraine's integration. We are already preparing for these upcoming events. We also had the first conversation in the history of bilateral relations with the President of Uganda. I informed him about our peace initiatives, which we are promoting at the UN, and about our principled position on the protection of international law. We discussed the potential of bilateral cooperation. In the evening I spoke with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. We are working in a very powerful manner together with the UK to strengthen our warriors, to bring our common victory closer, to implement our defense agreements reached during my visit to London. And it would be great if all our partners, like the UK, understood how the speed of defense supplies affects concrete successes on the battlefield. We also discussed important political issues that need to be resolved this week. The second half of the week will be even more active in terms of international relations. We are maintaining our diplomatic pace. As always, I received reports from our military, defense and security sector leaders throughout the day. In particular, today, Minister of Internal Affairs Ihor Klymenko reported on the formation of new brigades of the \"Offensive Guard\". The results are good. I have held several preparatory meetings in the context of further sanctions steps by our country. We will not reduce pressure on the enemy - both external and internal. I'll share the details. Of course, I was in touch with the commanders and our intelligence throughout the day. Today I would like to praise the warriors of the 15th regiment of the National Guard who are defending the Luhansk region and not only defending our positions, but also destroying the enemy in such a way that they are really limiting the offensive capabilities of the invaders in a particular direction. Thank you, guys! In the area of Maryinka in the Donetsk region, the warriors of the 79th separate air assault brigade are particularly effective, holding off enemy attacks every day and night. Almost half of all attacks in this area take place in that area. Our warriors stand strong. Thank you! Over the past day, the 5th separate assault regiment and the 80th separate air assault brigade have achieved results, bravely destroying the enemy south of Bakhmut. Thank you, warriors! I thank everyone who is now defending Ukraine in battles! Thank you to all those who are holding all our northern, eastern and southern directions! Glory to the Ukrainian warriors! Glory to all who strengthen our state! Glory to our beautiful people! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a very eventful day. First - the Staff. Extended format, detailed reports. Zaluzhny, Syrskyi, Tarnavskyi, Moskalyov, Nayev. The situation in the key directions. The east - very difficult. Hurtful. But we are doing everything to endure. The south - in some areas the situation is quite dangerous, but our warriors have means of response to the occupier. Odesa and the Black Sea area - the situation is under control. North - all our warriors in this area can see every intention of the enemy. We are reinforcing where necessary. There was a report by Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate Budanov on the current intentions of the occupier. There are decisions on our counteraction. Separately and in great detail, we addressed the issue of production and supply of ammunition and weapons. Of course, I cannot publicly disclose the details of this. But this is meaningful work. And I am glad to hear at the meeting of the Staff that even in such conditions we have the appropriate potential. During the evening I’ve been receiving detailed reports on the situation in Kherson. Another Russian strike damaged the main pipeline that provided heating to about six hundred houses - more than forty thousand people! Repair work will continue without pause until the heating supply is restored. And we will restore it! No matter what these Russian terrorists and bastards do, we will restore everything. Today I held talks with the Prime Minister of Spain, who arrived in Kyiv. I thanked him for the very important Spanish defense and political support. For the fact that during a year of full-scale war, Spain has stood with us in defense against Russian terror. This is a very valuable and value-based cooperation. It is here, on our land, that we are protecting the very values that underpin the life of not only our people, but also the vast majority of European nations. Of course, the life of Spain is based on these values too. That is why we understand each other very well. Spain has become part of our tank coalition. Spain helped us to protect our skies. There are many other parameters of support, both already provided and planned by us. Today I also met with a delegation of the global parliamentary network \"United for Ukraine\". These are representatives of 13 parliaments of European countries and the European Parliament. The topic of the meeting is quite clear: weapons for our warriors, sanctions against the terrorist state, and the implementation of our peace initiatives, including the Peace Formula. I spoke with the President of Egypt, including about the defense of international law, our work to restore food security, and some aspects of bilateral relations. It was a good conversation. I devoted a significant part of this day to preparing for tomorrow's diplomatic events. We must do everything to make them fruitful for Ukraine. Really significant not only in terms of symbolism, because it will be February 24. But also in terms of real benefits for our defense. Glory to our warriors! Glory to each and everyone who is now in combat! Thank you to everyone who helps us! Glory to Ukraine!"

It contained the two most important things, then and now. That Russia started a full-scale war against us. And that we are strong. We are ready for anything. We will defeat everyone. Because we are Ukraine! That is how February 24, 2022 began. The longest day of our lives. The hardest day of our modern history. We woke up early and haven't fallen asleep since. Some people were afraid, some were shocked, some did not know what to say, but everyone felt what to do. There were traffic jams on the roads, but many people were going to get weapons. Queues were forming. Some people stood at the borders, but many went to military registration and enlistment offices, and territorial defense units. We did not raise the white flag, and began to defend the blue and yellow. We were not afraid, we did not break down, we did not surrender. The symbol of this was the border guards of Zmiinyi Island and the route they told the Russian warship. Our faith has grown stronger. Our morale has been reinforced. We endured the first day of a full-scale war. We didn't know what would happen tomorrow, but we realized for sure: every tomorrow is worth fighting for! And we fought. And we fiercely fought for every day. And we endured the second day. And then - the third. Three days that we were predicted to last. They threatened that in 72 hours we would not exist. But we survived the fourth day. And then the fifth. And today we have been standing for exactly one year. And we still know: every tomorrow is worth fighting for! I am grateful to all those who make our resistance possible. These are all our defenders. The Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ground Forces, our infantry and tank-men. Air and Naval Forces. Artillery, air defense, paratroopers, intelligence, border guards. The Special Operations Forces, the Security Service, the National Guard, the police, the territorial defense units - all our security and defense forces. Thanks to you, Ukraine stands. And we endured the furious month and the furious beginning of the war. And then came spring. New attacks, new wounds, new pain. Everyone saw the true nature of our enemy. The shelling of the maternity hospital, the drama theater in Mariupol, Mykolaiv Regional State Administration, Svobody Square in Kharkiv, the train station in Kramatorsk. We saw Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka. The whole world clearly realized what the Russian world really means. What Russia is capable of. At the same time, the world saw what Ukraine is capable of. These are the new heroes. Defenders of Kyiv, defenders of Azovstal. New feats performed by entire cities. Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Mariupol, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Hostomel, Volnovakha, Bucha, Irpin, Okhtyrka. Hero Cities. The capitals of invincibility. New symbols. And with that, new assessments and forecasts for Ukraine. The first month of the war. And the first turning point in the war. The first changes in the world's perception of Ukraine. It did not fall in three days. It stopped the second army of the world. We took new hits every day, learned about new tragedies every day, but we endured thanks to those who gave it all they got every day. For the sake of others. These are our medics who rescue wounded soldiers on the frontline, perform surgeries under fire, deliver babies in bomb shelters, and stay on duty for days and weeks. Like our rescuers and firefighters who pull people out of the rubble and fire 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And our railroad workers who have been evacuating hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians since the beginning of the war without sleep or rest. And then there were the first offensives, the first achievements, the first liberated territories. The first and not the last Chornobaivka. Expulsion of the occupiers from the Kyiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions. Our Stuhna. Vilkha. Our Neptune and the sinking Moskva cruiser. The first Ramstein. And the second ever Lend-Lease. Ukraine has surprised the world. Ukraine has inspired the world. Ukraine has united the world. There are thousands of words to prove it, but a few will suffice. HIMARS, Patriot, Abrams, IRIS-T, Challenger, NASAMS, Leopard. I thank all of our partners, allies and friends who have stood side by side with us throughout the year. I am glad that the international anti-Putin coalition has grown so much that it requires a separate address. I will deliver it shortly. Definitely. I also thank our foreign policy army. Divisions of our diplomats, ambassadors, representatives in international organizations and institutions. All those who are fighting the occupiers with fire and sword of international law, achieving new sanctions and recognition of the terrorist state as a terrorist state. The war changed the fate of many families. It rewrote the history of our families. It changed our customs and traditions. Grandfathers used to tell their grandchildren how they beat the Nazis. Now grandchildren tell their grandfathers how they beat the Rashists. Mothers and grandmothers used to knit scarves, now they weave camouflage nets. Children used to ask Santa for smartphones and gadgets, but now they give pocket money and raise money for our soldiers. In fact, every Ukrainian has lost someone in the past year. A father, a son, a brother, a mother, a daughter, a sister. A loved one. A close friend, colleague, neighbor, acquaintance. My condolences. Almost everyone has at least one contact in their phone who will never pick up the phone again. Will never answer a text message \"How are you?\". These simple words have acquired a new meaning during the year of war. Every day, millions of Ukrainians have written or spoken this question to their loved ones millions of times. Every day, someone did not receive an answer. Every day, the occupiers killed our relatives and friends. We will not erase their names from the phone or from our own memory. We will never forget them. We will never forgive that. We will never rest until the Russian murderers face deserved punishment. The punishment of the International Tribunal. The judgment of God. Of our warriors. Or all of them together. The verdict is obvious. 9 years ago, the neighbor became an aggressor. A year ago, the aggressor became an executioner, looter and terrorist. We have no doubt that they will be held accountable. We have no doubt that we will win. In the summer we felt it. We passed 100 days of war. We received EU candidate status, returned Zmiinyi Island, heard the first \"Bavovna\" in Crimea, saw fireworks at the occupier's warehouses and Antonivskyi Bridge. August was the first month when the occupiers did not take a single Ukrainian city. Threats and ultimata about denazification were replaced by gestures of goodwill. And we felt then that our victory was inevitable. It is close. It will come. And then came the autumn. And our counteroffensive. The liberation of Izyum, Balakliya, Kupyansk, Lyman, the Kherson region and the city of Kherson. We saw how people there met our military. How they cherished the Ukrainian flag. How they were waiting and returned to Ukraine. I want to address those who are still waiting. Our citizens who are now under temporary occupation. Ukraine has not abandoned you, has not forgotten about you, has not given up on you. One way or another, we will liberate all our lands. We will do everything for Ukraine to return. And to all those who are now forced to stay abroad, we will do everything for you to return to Ukraine. We will do everything to make it possible. We will fight and bring back every single one of our captive soldiers. Only all this together will be a victory. We can see it even in the dark. Despite the constant massive missile attacks and power outages. We see the light of this victory. In their memories of their first feelings on February 24, 2022, people mention shock, pain, and uncertainty. A year after the full-scale invasion, the faith in victory is 95%. The main emotion we feel when we think about Ukraine is pride. For every Ukrainian man, every Ukrainian woman. Pride for us. We have become one big army. We have become a team where someone finds, someone packs, someone brings, but everyone donates. I am grateful to our people, grateful to our multi-million army of volunteers and citizens who do care, who can collect and get everything necessary. We have become one. Our journalists and media are a united front fighting against lies and panic. We have become one family. There are no more strangers among us. Ukrainians today are all fellows. Ukrainians have sheltered Ukrainians, opened their homes and hearts to those who were forced to flee the war. We withstand all threats, shelling, cluster bombs, cruise missiles, kamikaze drones, blackouts, and cold. We are stronger than that. It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity. The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Mr. President Gitanas! Dear rector! Ladies and Gentlemen! Lithuanian people! You and us, Ukrainians and Lithuanians, are walking together through the history of Europe. We are united by generations and centuries. We have gone through good times and tragic times, peaceful times and brutal times. Through all the years of our existence, Ukrainians and Lithuanians have always been fighting for freedom, one way or another. Now is a great time. A time when we can win and guarantee our freedom not just for years, not just for decades. Now is the time when we can protect our freedom forever. Russia must lose in Ukraine. Russian revanchism must forever forget about Kyiv and Vilnius, about Chișinău and Warsaw, about our brothers in Latvia and Estonia, in Georgia and in every other country that is now threatened by Russian murderers. We can do it. We have this historic chance. And I thank all of you, Lithuanian people, I thank all of you, friends, for doing everything you can with us to not miss this historic chance. Defense assistance, political, economic, humanitarian - there is no area in which Ukraine has not felt Lithuania's sincerity and determination. Ukrainians will always remember this and will always remain grateful for this. And I believe that this year we can add another milestone to our history: our joint victory in the war against a common enemy. We will preserve our independence. We will definitely preserve it. This means that we must act now to give our nations reliable guarantees of non-return of evil. The Ukrainian Peace Formula consists of ten points that provide just such guarantees. These are obviously necessary security points. This is the obviously necessary de-occupation of Ukraine. And this is obviously necessary justice for all those who suffered from Russian aggression. No person on earth should ever again be threatened by hunger and radiation disasters, aggression and terror, energy sector destruction and blackout of international law, deportation and ecocide. Russia is bringing all this with its aggression. We will wipe it all off. Our heroic warriors will do it. Our cooperation with you and with the whole world will do it. Our Peace Formula will do it. And as a result, we will make our Peace Formula the basis for a new security for everyone in Europe and everyone in the world who values life. I am sure that Lithuania will be on this path with us! Glory to all who fight for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear people of Germany! Mr. Federal President! Mr. Chancellor, Olaf! Today is the year since everything has changed. Changed for Ukraine, for Germany, for the whole of Europe and the free world. What the free world has become accustomed to over decades of peace has turned out to be something that needs to be fought for. Diplomacy did not work. The existing security architecture in the world did not work. The old European hope that economic ties could keep Russian tank columns from moving did not work. But there was something that did work. First of all, unity. Unity of Ukraine, Germany, and the entire free world. And determination. Determination to protect the foundations of our lives. We are fighting on Ukrainian soil for what all of you, dear friends, cannot imagine your lives without. This is basic security. This is freedom and life under the law. This is human dignity and the right of every person and every community to be respected. This is happiness of living in a family and an opportunity to dream of a safe and free future for your children. Simple things that 1877 Ukrainian cities and villages are now deprived of. The occupier seeks to increase this number and add millions more broken lives to the already broken ones. You know, in our Mariupol, occupied by Russia, there are almost no undamaged houses left. Russia has done everything to kill this city. Almost half a million people used to live there. 90% of Mariupol is destroyed. Remnants of houses that were destroyed by Russian bombs and missiles, parts of the city that were burned by the occupiers are being demolished by Russia to turn these terrible ruins into concrete crumbs. The crumbs that are going to be used to build roads. We have to do everything possible and impossible to prevent Russia from turning Ukraine, our neighbors, and the whole of Europe, which Russian revanchism wants to reach, into concrete crumbs. Can we win? Yes, we are capable of it. United. Determined. And unbreakable. We are able to end the Russian aggression this year already. Germany has been with us since the first minutes of the Russian invasion. Germany is helping us protect Ukrainians from Russian terror. And Germany will be with us on the day of the victory of freedom, will be with us when we save our cities and villages, now occupied, from Russian captivity. The people of Germany! Mr. Federal President! Mr. Chancellor Olaf! Now is the time when our bravery and our weapons can restore peace and create a historically important deterrent to any aggression. No one will dare to start aggression against another nation when they know that the free world will protect that nation. No one will ever again encroach on freedom when they know that the free world is determined enough to defend freedom. No one will repeat February 24 last year when they know that there is not a single occupier left on the entire territory of Ukraine. We can ensure that - together with you! Together with everyone in the world who values life. I thank you for your support! Thank you for being with us throughout this year! Thank you, President, thank you, Olaf, for your faith in Ukraine, in our people, and in our shared values of a free, united, and peaceful Europe! Glory to everyone who fights for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! The tenth package of EU sanctions against Russia for starting the war was approved today. The tenth and obviously not the last package. Sanctions will continue to be introduced so that nothing remains of the potential of Russian aggression. Now, new sanctions steps are in the tenth package, powerful, against the defense industry and the financial sector of the terrorist state and against the propagandists who drowned Russian society in lies and are trying to spread their lies to the whole world. They definitely won't succeed. Our diplomats and the entire state are working to extend global and, in particular, European sanctions to the Russian nuclear industry, Rosatom, all those involved in the missile program and nuclear blackmail of the terrorist state. The partners – the United States, the UK – have already made relevant steps. We expect the appropriate steps from the European Union. Of course, we will continue working on Ukraine's sanctions against Russian entities and all those who help them. The appropriate decisions will be made. Our resolution, adopted at the UN General Assembly, gave a very good diplomatic impetus this week. The resolution on peace for Ukraine, on the territorial integrity of our state, and protection of international law against Russian aggression. In fact, we see that the essence of our Peace Formula is becoming the basis of specific international political and legal decisions, and the world majority supports them. I thank each of the 141 states that supported our resolution. I thank every leader of the states and every nation who value freedom and international order equally with Ukraine. Of course, every success of our diplomats, every foreign policy opportunity for our state, and every manifestation of world attention to Ukrainians is based on the resilience of the people of Ukraine, the resilience of our soldiers. On the fact that Ukraine is strong and constantly getting stronger. The world loves the strong. And helps the brave. The global center of strength and courage is now right here, in Ukraine, right in our people who defend our state. Who defend our land, our Donetsk region, our Luhansk region, all our lands, where very tough and painful battles continue. I thank each of our soldier, everyone who steadfastly, strongly, and bravely defends our positions in Donbas, destroys the enemy, and I thank you for such a powerful result in the east. The result in the east, so that, consequently, we have the result in all other directions as well. Today, I will honor the fighters of the 56th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade and the 77th Separate Mobile Airborne Brigade for their heroism and effectiveness in the battles near Bakhmut. Well done, guys! Gunners of the 55th Zaporizhzhia Sich brigade, marines of the 35th Separate Brigade named after Rear-Admiral Ostrogradsky, infantrymen of the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade named after Handziuk, and the 72nd Separate Brigade named after Black Zaporozhians, as well as paratroopers of the 79th Air Assault Brigade – all in Donbas – I thank you, guys, for the worthy repulse of the enemy! I especially would like to thank today all servicemen of the Engineering and Aviation Service of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. All those who work on the ground, so that Ukraine wins in the sky. Today is a professional holiday of our military aviation engineers. These are people, whose expertise and reliability fully confirmed our ability to defend the sky. I thank everyone who makes this engineering aviation contribution to the approach of our victory! Glory to everyone who is now in battle! Thank you to everyone who helps defend Ukraine from Russian aggression! Bright memory to all the heroes who gave their lives for us, for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Free people of a free country! I can address you, the people of Denmark, in this way. I can address the people of Ukraine in this way. I do so, and that's a luxury in today's world. A luxury that many people only dream about. Our peoples, Ukrainians and Danes, breathe freely. We have freedom, like most Europeans. And we will not lose our freedom, because we not only dream about it, we fight for it. We have not missed the moment that was pivotal. Last year, when the Russian evil started an all-out war against us, we were not afraid. We did not lose our grip. Ukrainians stood up to defend the state. The free world stood up to defend Ukraine. And I thank you, the people of Denmark, for not wavering in your commitment to our defense. I thank you for realizing that freedom cannot be just a dream, it must be actions. Actions in defense of life and people, rules and respect, justice and security. Thank you, people of Denmark, for your actions! For the weapons that help our defense. For the policy that helps isolate the aggressor. For your willingness to join our reconstruction after hostilities. And, of course, for your belief that the project of a united and free Europe cannot be complete without Ukraine's full integration. I know that there were many Ukrainian flags on the streets of many cities in Denmark during this year of our unity. I am grateful to you for every such flag of Ukraine in your cities, in your squares. The blue and yellow colors of Ukraine have always been a freedom-loving sign. They always indicate the presence of freedom. And therefore, they indicate the presence of bravery. Your bravery, people of Denmark, is a fact already. Your bravery, Mrs. Prime Minister, is a fact already. Your bravery, dear members of the Danish Folketing, is also a fact already. Just as our Ukrainian bravery is a fact. Hence, our freedom will never cease to be a real fact of our lives. Thank you for your support! Thank you for every day that we have gone through and will go through together! I am sure we will be with you on our major day - the day of our victory. Mange tak, Danske folk! Glory to all who fight for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, we are ending this week with a strong diplomatic event - for the first time in 32 years, a high-level delegation from Saudi Arabia visited Ukraine. This is yet another sign of respect for Ukraine, for our invincibility and strength. Respect of the world. Monday – the leader of the United States of America, President Joe Biden, was in Kyiv. Director of the International Monetary Fund was in Kyiv. Tuesday – Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was in Kyiv. And a powerful delegation from the U.S. Congress - representatives of the Republican Party - was also in Kyiv. Wednesday - a conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The first conversation in the history of bilateral relations with the President of Uganda. A conversation with the President of Pakistan. A conversation with the President of Estonia. Thursday - Spanish Prime Minister Sánchez was in Kyiv. A conversation with the President of Egypt. A visit of representatives of the global parliamentary network \"United for Ukraine\". These are 13 European states’ parliaments and the European Parliament. Finally, a historically significant vote of the UN General Assembly in favor of our resolution on peace and territorial integrity of our country. 141 countries endorsed it! Friday, the anniversary of invincibility - Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki was in Kyiv, and Leopards, modern battle tanks, arrived in Ukraine. The result we have been working on for many, many months. The meeting of the G7 leaders and Ukraine's participation in this meeting. Over the past year, Ukraine has become a traditional participant in top international formats. Now I had another good meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It was the first official visit of such level by a representative of this country. Of course, we are working on a higher level of visits and relations. But now we have finally reached an interaction. And this, by the way, brings concrete and sensitive results for Ukrainians, in particular with regard to the release of prisoners of war. I thank our Saudi partners for their cooperation and assistance. This is one week. And again and again, it's about strengthening our state, our soldiers, our steadfastness, our international positions. Today, I met with representatives of our Ukrainian television, the Ukrainian telethon \"United News\". Journalists, editors, producers. It was a meaningful online meeting. The reason for the meeting is the anniversary of the telethon and gratitude to everyone who works in it. But the content was much broader. We talked about intensifying the information work of our state and society. This especially concerns those parts of the world where our diplomacy has not been represented for many decades for various reasons. And now we have to make sure that we are as powerful as possible in terms of information and diplomacy. We need to make Ukraine's position absolutely clear in all parts of the world. This is important in our work to ensure the de-occupation of the territory and our planned active actions. The more people know about Ukraine, the more they understand Ukraine, the more they support Ukraine, the closer our victory becomes. I once again thank everyone who works in the telethon, who creates this information foundation of our national unity. Thank you for your dedication to the Ukrainian cause, for your sincere desire to find and develop formats that will strengthen the telethon and, therefore, Ukraine. And I thank you for your constant search for new methods of work for those who are now in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, for finding new ways to access our people in Donetsk, Luhansk, the south of the country, and Crimea. It is very important that Russia has not succeeded in closing off our people and our land informationally in the part of Ukraine where the terrorists' tricolor is still present. We have to do everything we can - and we will do everything to ensure that our people have more access to truthful information. Today, on February 26, we mark the Day of Resistance to the Occupation of Crimea and Sevastopol. And today this conversation is especially important. It is about ensuring an understanding through information and all other means that Ukraine will not abandon anyone, will not leave anyone to the enemy. We will return all our people and everything ours from Russian captivity. In 2014, Russian aggression began with the seizure of Crimea. It is logical that by liberating Crimea, we will put a historic end to any attempts by Russia to ruin the lives of Ukrainians and all the peoples of Europe and Asia that the Kremlin once claimed to conquer. International law will prevail here, on the lands of Ukraine: in Donbas, Pryazovia, Kherson region and Crimea. I thank everyone who brings this victory closer! I thank everyone who helps our people in the temporarily occupied territory! Glory to each and every one who is now in combat! By the way, today I am especially grateful to our guys from the 110th separate mechanized brigade who shot down another enemy aircraft near Avdiivka! Glory to all our heroes of resistance in the temporarily occupied territory! All of Ukraine will be free! And one more thing. Today we have new decisions of our state on sanctions against those who are involved or help Russia wage war and destroy lives and people. I signed three decrees to implement the NSDC decisions. Against those Russians who are involved in the abduction of Ukrainian children. Against those representatives of the Russian sports sector who are trying to put sports in the service of aggression. And against those who help maintain mercenary structures in Russia for the war against Ukraine and all free people. Ukraine's pressure will continue. The world's pressure on the terrorist state will continue. Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on this day. The day began with an attack by Iranian drones. Most of them were shot down. Eleven out of fourteen. Unfortunately, there were also hits. Three employees of the State Emergency Service in Khmelnytskyi were wounded, two were killed. My condolences to the families. The second drone hit just as the fire was being extinguished after the first hit. In fact, that is why we need the aviation component of air defense - modern combat aircraft - to protect the entire territory of our country from Russian terror. Air defense is complete only when it is backed by aviation. Modern aviation. Our pilots, together with our anti-aircraft gunners, together with all the warriors and specialists of our Air Forces, are already doing a great job. But we will be able to fully protect the sky when the aviation taboo in relations with our partners is lifted. The elimination of consequences of the power grid accident in Odesa and the Odesa region lasted all day. There was a large-scale power outage, but the power supply was restored within a day. As of this evening, all critical infrastructure and the vast majority of consumers have electricity. I am grateful to all power engineers and repair crews who ensured a quick result. Ukraine demonstrated and will continue to demonstrate that our resilience is higher than anyone's expectations. Today, I held several meetings with representatives of the government and security agencies. In particular, a meeting with Head of the Security Service of Ukraine Vasyl Malyuk. We discussed current issues and our steps to protect the state in the near future. We will not leave any chance to any internal threats, just as we don’t leave it to external ones. Of course, I am constantly in touch with our commanders. Special attention to the situation in the east, of course, in the Donetsk region. Bakhmut direction - the situation is getting more and more difficult. The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions, to gain a foothold and ensure defense. Our warriors defending the Bakhmut sector are real heroes. I am grateful to each and every person who is heroically holding this direction and other directions in Donbas. I thank each and every one who helps our warriors and does everything to ensure that our defenders have as many weapons, long-range weapons, powerful weapons as possible. Today, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury paid a visit to Kyiv. I thanked her for the vital financial support for our country. We discussed our current cooperation both at the level between Ukraine and the United States and at the level of global financial institutions, including the IMF. We discussed the needs for reconstruction in Ukraine and the restoration of justice for our people and the entire free world, which means launching a real mechanism of compensation for the damage caused by this war... compensation at the cost of Russian assets. This is not an easy task. But fulfilling it and directing Russian assets to compensate for the war damage will be one of the most powerful hits of the free world against this aggressor and against any aggression in general. I think a format for compensation will be found and Russia will pay for its war. In every sense. Glory to each and every one who is now fighting for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps! May the memory of all those whose lives were taken by Russian terror be eternal! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Thank you so much! Thank you, Mr. President, thanks everybody! Thank you for your kind words and support! Ladies and Gentlemen! I greet you from free Ukraine, and thank you for your attention and support of our struggle for freedom and independence. And I am sure that none of you doubt that we will win this fight. Ukraine is indeed the place where democracy will defeat tyranny. The united democracy – Ukrainian, American, all our allies and partners. But what will our joint victory mean? This is not a purely ideological battle.  Yes, we will prove that democracy is stronger than tyranny. When Russia loses, we will prove that terrorist states cannot overcome the power of a united democratic world. And when we restore our territorial integrity, we will also restore the full power of international law, which is equally important for everyone in the world. However, the battle is for much more, and there will be more winners in it. The human nature is yet another battlefield, where the confrontation continues. Right now. In what will the creativity of the human mind be more successful? In serving good or evil? What will give more prospects – hard work or complicity in making money from the aggression? This confrontation is going on right now. And that is why right now we are calling on all businesses to come to Ukraine and to leave the Russian market. It is obvious, that post-hostilities reconstruction of Ukraine will give an extraordinary moral advantage to all businesses that will be in. And it is also obvious that every business that is now helping the Russian tyranny, in any way, will not be able to avoid problems and a reputation crisis. The American business has every opportunity to take leadership positions both in the reconstruction of the Ukrainian economy and infrastructure, and in demonstrating to the world that human nature should serve worthy goals and that it produces – and will always produce! – the best result. The Ukrainian life will inevitably get a new start after this war. We need to rebuild the energy system of Ukraine based on new security principles. It is in Ukraine that we will combine green transformation with security transformation and create an example for the same transformation in other countries. Such as to protect a specific country from any aggression against the energy industry. And such that protects all humanity under the framework of a smart climate policy. For example, on the Virtual Power Plants market, 7 out of 15 key companies are American. This is the experience that Ukraine needs. And Ukraine is an opportunity that will give a historic impulse to the entire industry. Plus solar power plants, wind power plants, small hydroelectric power plants, biomass burning plants... Our modernized and decentralized energy system is a project worth hundreds of billions of dollars and with the potential of replication for other nations. We need to restore hundreds of thousands of industry, infrastructure and social facilities, residential buildings. Whole cities, industries, productions. This is a colossal task, but realistic. Ukraine is interested in projects to create a full production cycle of titanium, lithium, aluminum and  ferrous metallurgy. Ukrainian oil refineries, which were destroyed by Russian missile strikes, and a capacious domestic market provide the opportunity to restore this industry on a modern technological basis. Machine building in Ukraine, agricultural processing in Ukraine, weapons production in Ukraine, including modern drones, IT in Ukraine, infrastructure and transport in Ukraine, localization of business in Ukraine and convenient logistics with other markets from Ukraine, human capital of Ukraine – all these are not just investment opportunities, not just industries and not just growth. This is a wide space for victories. Your victories, American business! And I urge you to prepare for these victories now, to come to Ukraine now. So that by the time we restore peace, your hard work has already yielded results. I believe that it will be so! Thank you for your attention! I invite all of you to Ukraine! Glory to our brave soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!"

  "speech": "Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is the day when, in various formats, we worked for justice for Ukraine and Ukrainians in one way or another. Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan is on a visit to Ukraine. These are an institution and a person who undoubtedly play a historic role in bringing Russian criminals to justice. Russia's genocidal policy against our people will definitely have inevitable legal consequences for all those who conceived, approved and implement such a policy. And I want to emphasize: this isn’t only about the executors, but also about the top political and military leadership of the terrorist state. Today we discussed this with Karim Khan during a meeting in Kyiv. Of course, this is not an easy job. But responding to Russian crimes in the face of this aggression exactly in terms of the rule of law and exactly with the power of an international court is what will serve as one of the guarantees of the long-term future security of both Ukrainians and other nations. We will ensure this. We are approaching the opening of the Ukrainian office of the International Criminal Court. There is already effective cooperation in Ukraine between the International Criminal Court and the Office of the Prosecutor General. We pay special attention to such Russian crimes as the deportation of our people and the deportation of Ukrainian children. We will dismantle this entire Russian genocidal system, from the cogs to the architects, and bring them to legal verdicts. Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. Again in an expanded format. The Main Intelligence Directorate, the Ministry of Defense, the Commander-in-Chief, and the commanders of directions delivered reports. We are dealing in detail with the situation on each of the frontline directions. The most difficult situation is still Bakhmut and the battles that are important for the defense of the city. I'll give you just one example. Nowadays, the meetings of the Staff are held quite often - at least twice a week. The last meeting was on Thursday. And today, General Syrskyi reported that since the last meeting, about 800 enemies have been killed in his direction alone. Russia does not count people at all, sending them to constantly storm our positions. The intensity of fighting is only increasing. I thank all Ukrainian warriors who, despite this insane pressure from the occupier, are defending our positions and destroying the Russian army! I thank each and every one who supports our warriors! Of course, we also considered other areas in Donbas, as well as the areas of responsibility of the Tavria and Odesa groups. General Moskalyov reported on the situation around Kherson and the region. This day there were more than 30 Russian shelling occasions in the Kherson region! They were shelling just streets, just people. My condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones. Today we have already lost four people. We will do everything to suppress the terrorists. General Nayev reported on the situation in the north and along the border - our forces are in control of the situation. As always, we reviewed in detail the logistics for the frontline and the coverage of deficits. We are preparing for the return of our warriors to actions for the liberation of our land. We keep in mind this just goal of ours, and every day we are getting closer to its fulfillment. Ukraine will be free. All of Ukraine. Today I met with the Secretary-General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This is one of the most powerful global organizations that brings together the world's leading countries. Those countries where people really want to live. Our goal is for Ukraine to fully join the organization and to use the OECD experience to modernize our country. Tomorrow we are opening the OECD Office in Kyiv. Today we talked, in particular, about a fair tax system for Ukrainians - transparent, simple, and one that will strike a balance between stimulating business and economic growth and ensuring social justice. I also offered the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to join the work on directing Russia's assets to compensate for the damage caused by Russian aggression. If someone thinks that this is an unrealistic task, today, on February 28, we have very concrete evidence that there are no unrealistic tasks for Ukraine. A year ago, on the fifth day of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine applied to join the European Union. This was the first step in obtaining the candidacy. We have done a tremendous and tremendously fast job and have secured candidate status for Ukraine. This year, we should reach a decision on membership negotiations for Ukraine. Another example. Today, there was no shortage in our energy system. There were no power outages across the country. Thousands of people have been working every day to achieve this result. They restored what could be restored after the Russian strikes. They protected the energy system. They helped cities, communities, and people. Of course, the threat still remains. Of course, we will fight and defend ourselves. We will definitely endure, no matter what the enemy does. I thank each and every one who contributed to this task! One more thing. Today is the Day of Air Navigation Service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is the day of those specialists of our defense forces on whom the effectiveness of Ukrainian combat aviation directly depends. Thousands of successful sorties and successful air strikes on enemy positions are their merit, the merit of our navigators. I congratulate you, warriors, on your holiday, and wish you complete dominance of the Ukrainian Air Force in the Ukrainian sky! Absolutely fair dominance. Glory to each and every one who is now fighting for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!"
